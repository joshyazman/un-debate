"1",32,"AFG",57,2002,"﻿Not very far from here stoodtwo towers that symbolized freedom  prosperity andprogress. Halfway around the globe stood twomagnificent Buddhas that represented a culture oftolerance and a nation with a rich history. Thesesymbols have now been linked together through theglobal scourge of terrorism. Terror may havedemolished these physical structures  yet it served tostrengthened the resolve of the internationalcommunity never to abandon the spirit anddetermination with which these icons were built.Terrorism and violence are against the teaching ofIslam; a religion that stands for peace  respect forhuman dignity  dialogue  and tolerance. The Taliban who destroyed our country and cultural heritage  didnot represent Afghans  nor does the Al-Qaida representthe Arab world. Even more  neither one representsIslam.The Afghan people  as the prime victims of warand violence  and the front line fighters againstterrorism  particularly appreciate  honour and admirethe friendly hand extended to them by the United Statesof America and other members of the anti-terrorcoalition  the International Security Assistance Force(ISAF)  the United Nations Organization  particularlythe Secretary-General Kofi Annan  whom I mustthank for his kind remarks and support of Afghanistanthis morning  as well as Ambassador LakhdarBrahimi  the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  for their tremendous support to Afghanistanduring this critical juncture of Afghan history.Sir  I am honoured to have this opportunity tohighlight some achievements of my Administrationduring the brief course of the past eight months. First the implementation of the Bonn Agreement and thepeace process in my country are quite on track. Inaccordance with the terms of the Bonn Agreement  thepeople of Afghanistan manifested their robustresolution and solid consensus for democracy and therule of law by gathering under one tent to convene theemergency Loya Jirga  that is the Afghan GrandCouncil  held on 11 to 17 June 2002. The success ofthe Loya Jirga  with broad and unprecedentedparticipation of women  was a significant milestone inthe recent history of Afghanistan  and a major stepforward in the process of peace  stability and nation-building. During the proceeding of the Loya Jirga hundreds of delegates exercised their right to freespeech and expressed their desire for security  peace national unity  reconstruction  democracy and goodgovernance.The people of Afghanistan told me univocally oftheir disdain for war and violence. The Loya Jirgademonstrated that after 23 years of imposed wars foreign interventions  violence  bloodshed  repression destruction and subversion  Afghans are on the way toenjoy peace and benefit from reconstruction. Hence they are determined to take every measure to avoid arelapse into warlordism and lawlessness.Secondly  as a result of the back-to-schoolcampaign  schools that were closed for over six years when neither boys nor girls went to school  havereopened. Three million children from all over thecountry  both boys and girls  have returned to school.Thirdly  the strong commitment of theGovernment to the eradication of poppy cultivation andthe destruction of narcotics resulted in the burning ofdrugs worth an estimated street value of 8 billiondollars.Fourthly  as a sign of stability and security  weare very glad to have over 1.6 million of our refugees who were mainly living in Pakistan and Iran  returnhome in a period of less than seven to eight months.Fifthly  we have formed a ConstitutionalCommission to undertake the historic task of draftingthe country's new Constitution. We have alreadyestablished a Judicial Commission  to rebuild theAfghan justice system  a Civil Service Commission toreform the entire administration and impose a merit-based system  as well as a Human Rights Commissionto protect human rights  women's rights and civilliberties. We have also adopted a series of laws anddecrees to promote and attract domestic andinternational investments  safeguard property rightsand other pillars of the free market economy  combatnarcotics  and protect the forests and the environment.Sixthly  despite these achievements  we arerealistic about countless challenges and problems thatwe are confronted with. Foremost among them issecurity; a principal demand of the Afghan people  andthe most fundamental requirement for sustainablepeace. It is the position of my Government that the realkey to the restoration of sustainable security lies in thecreation of a national army and a national policeforce  along with a comprehensive demobilizationprogramme.We have established a commission for theformation of a national army. I have also highlightedthe establishment of the national army and police forceas a top priority and the main objective of myGovernment; but the people of Afghanistan need aclear commitment and sustained support from theinternational community to realize these objectives.We appreciate the contributions of our American British  German  Turkish and French friends in trainingour national army and police force  and theGovernment of Japan for its assistance indemobilization programmes. I would like to once againrequest the donor countries to further support ourstrategy for the creation of a national army and anational system for security by translating internationalpledges into concrete contributions.The Afghan delegates from various provinces thatregularly come to Kabul to discuss various matterswith our Administration  strongly request theexpansion of the International Security AssistanceForce (ISAF) to other parts of the country. They wantto be certain that Afghanistan will not be once againleft alone by the international community.We owe particular gratitude to the donorcommunity for its assistance to Afghanistan  but wouldalso like to remind our friends that the majority of thefinancial pledges made to Afghanistan at the TokyoConference are still unfulfilled. We have presented thedonor countries with our National DevelopmentFramework to indicate our priorities  help manage thereconstruction programmes effectively  and channelfinancial resources to national capacity building. It isthe position of my Government that the consolidationof peace and stability depends on the internationalcommunity's sustained engagement in providingfunding for reconstruction.Implementation of labour-intensive projectsthroughout Afghanistan has a direct influence onsecurity and the demobilization of combatants. Despitethese facts  the level of direct financial supportprovided to the Afghan Government can becharacterized as insufficient  especially given thegenerosity of donors at the Tokyo Conference  whereover $4.5 billion dollars were pledged to supportAfghanistan. The Afghan people urgently needs thepledges in Tokyo to be turned into cash.While we agree that there is still a humanitariancrisis in Afghanistan  I would like to request theinternational community to focus more onreconstruction  to support long-term recovery efforts and to treat the causes of poverty  rather than itssymptoms. Building highways and repairing the roadnetworks in Afghanistan is an important undertakingwith significant economic  political and social impactfor the Afghan people. It creates jobs  helps withsecurity and demobilization  provides betterconnectivity  strengthens national unity and assists withthe reintegration of Afghanistan into the regionaleconomy.While the world has now clearly voiced its unityto honour the dignity of life and reconstruction overterror  destruction and subversion  the threat posed bythe terrorist groups requires resolute commitment onthe part of all nations to fight this evil to the end. Iwarned the world before the 11 September tragedyabout the dangers of terrorism. The Afghan peoplehave suffered tremendously at the hands of the Talibanand terrorist groups. They killed many thousands of ourpeople  destroyed villages and burned orchards andvineyards.Afghanistan is a Muslim country and the peopleof Afghanistan truly believe in the teachings of Islam which is based on peace  justice  equality  moderationand tolerance  and reject any abuse and misuse of theholy name of Islam by extremist groups to justifyviolence  death and destruction. My vision ofAfghanistan is of a modern State that builds on ourIslamic values  promoting justice  the rule of law human rights and freedom of commerce  and forming abridge between cultures and civilizations  a model oftolerance and prosperity based on the rich heritage ofthe Islamic civilization.Afghanistan is committed to continuing to havefriendly relations with its neighbours and the12international community and to being a resilientpartner in the war against terrorism. The establishmentof security and prosperity within Afghanistan is ameans of promoting security and prosperity in theregion and the world as a whole. We do not want tolive in the past and are determined not to let the eventsof the past harm our relations with our neighbours. Weextend a sincere hand of friendship to all ourneighbours on the basis of mutual respect forsovereignty  territorial integrity  independence and non-interference in the internal affairs of each other. Wewill never permit our soil to be used for any subversiveactivities against any of our neighbours or countries inthe region  and we expect others to do the same.We are deeply concerned about the loss ofinnocent lives in Palestine and Israel. We stronglysupport the realization of the right of self-determination of the people of Palestine. We alsosupport the relevant United Nations resolutions and theSaudi Arabian-sponsored declarations in Beirut. We arealso concerned about the dispute between our friendsand neighbours  India and Pakistan. We have goodrelationships with both those countries. The people ofAfghanistan know the high price of war and violenceand are yearning for peace  stability and prosperity inthe region. They know that a peaceful resolution of theissues between Pakistan and India is an urgentnecessity to consolidate peace and security in theregion and the world at large.In conclusion  I would like to take thisopportunity to congratulate Switzerland and East Timoron joining the family of the United Nations  and extendmy appreciation to Iran and Pakistan  our neighbouringcountries  for having accepted millions of our refugeesfor over two decades and for having looked after them.We are very grateful to both these neighbours. We arealso very grateful to the donor countries for havinghelped Afghanistan and to the internationalorganizations that have helped us over the past manymonths and years."
"2",71,"AGO",57,2002,"﻿Allow me  onbehalf of my Government and in my own name  tosalute Mr. Kavan on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly. We are convinced that hisknowledge and diplomatic experience will guide us tosuccess in our activities.As the international situation remains caught inthe throes of instability  insecurity  economicbackwardness and the scourge of pandemics andhunger  we nevertheless note with pleasure the greatprogress that has been made since our last session.After decades of conflict  peace was finally restoredthroughout southern Africa and is now slowlybecoming a reality in other regions. The people of EastTimor were finally able to assert their self-determination and independence. Countries such asAngola  which have actively advocated the legitimaterights and interests of East Timor at the UnitedNations  take great pleasure in welcoming that newsister republic to the family of this world Organization.Important advances were also made by theinternational community in the struggle againstterrorism. Thanks to a global and coordinated effort major terrorist networks have been dismembered.Angola reiterates its strong condemnation of terroristacts  such as that perpetrated against the American22people in September last year. Angola continues to becommitted to the strict implementation of SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001). We support strongercontrol measures  particularly in the financial area  soas increasingly to curb the scope of action of terroristgroups.All these advances underscore the fact that  inspite of their complexity  the serious problems thatafflict our world today can be resolved. No country orregion should be doomed to live forever under thescourge of war and terror or be deprived of its rights.Under the auspices of the United Nations  theinternational community must react to crisis situationsexpeditiously and effectively. Experience has shownthat belated and ineffectual reactions lead to theescalation of protracted and intractable conflicts especially in Africa. Fortunately  however  theindividual and collective efforts of many Governmentsin Africa are now easing these tensions  laying theessential bases for a solid  just and lasting peace.The current situation in Angola is a reflection ofthat reality. For the first time since our independence Angola and Angolans are now enjoying a climate ofauthentic peace  thanks to the allaying of factors thatcould have provoked a resurgence of the past war andinsecurity. The efforts of the Angolan Governmenthave blazed the trail from a fratricidal war towardsirreversible peace  thanks to the goodwill and profoundpatriotic spirit demonstrated by all Angolans. Militaryhostilities effectively ended seven months ago. Thepeace understandings reached on 4 April have beenscrupulously adhered to. Armed political parties nolonger exist. Today  there is just one single army  underthe authority of the Angolan Government.The peace process will soon be concluded withthe completion of the political tasks still pending underthe Lusaka Protocol. In Angola  the process ofeconomic and social rehabilitation is well under wayand Government institutions have begun to operatenormally throughout our national territory.Clearly  given the current situation  it will bedifficult for the Angolan Government to riseappropriately to the nation's economic and socialchallenges. Our main challenge now lies in thereintegration into society of thousands of combatveterans  4 million displaced persons  refugees andthousands upon thousands of handicapped  war orphansand widows.On behalf of my Government  I would like toavail myself of this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General  members of the troika of observer nations inthe peace process and all those who  in various ways have contributed to the achievement of peace in Angolaand who have pledged their assistance to solve theproblems caused by the recently ended war.Now at peace  Angola is more than ever readyand willing to take up its role as a sister nation ofAfrica and of the world. In the coming days  it willassume the presidency of the Southern AfricaDevelopment Community  the most important regionalorganization for the economic integration of southernAfrica. Angola is also a candidate for a non-permanentseat in the Security Council in the elections scheduledfor this session of the General Assembly. In thesebodies  Angola intends to contribute actively towardsan environment of stability  fostering the developmentand economic welfare of our peoples. Of centralconcern to Angola is the issue of peace in CentralAfrica  particularly in the Democratic Republic of theCongo. Only over time will it be possible to avert thewidespread destabilization of the region.Angola has been a factor of stability in CentralAfrica  having contributed substantially to thecessation of the wave of violence and to the relativepeace now enjoyed by the population in the area.In the context of these efforts  and underAngola's aegis  the Presidents of the DRC and Ugandasigned an agreement in Luanda on 6 September. Thiswas seen as a crucial step for the complete settlementof the Congolese conflict and for the establishment ofgood neighbourly relations between the two countries.Angola welcomes the diplomatic initiativesundertaken by other countries to resolve the conflict whether or not they are involved in the conflict  underthe Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and theunderstandings reached by the Congolese partiesthemselves. Angola advocates a new regional order ofpeace  security  cooperation and development  to bebased on respect for sovereignty and territorialintegrity  non-intervention in the internal affairs ofother States  democratic values and respect for humanrights. We are willing to work together with othercentral and southern African countries and to offerthem our good offices.The instability in some parts of the world requiresa greater measure of commitment by the United23Nations and the parties concerned for peace andsecurity. Special attention should continue to befocused on the settlement of the Somali conflict fostering unification of the country and consolidationof lasting peace there. In Western Sahara  we areconcerned at delays in the process towards areferendum by those resident in the territory. Angolaurges the parties involved to show flexibility and tocontinue cooperating with the United Nations and theAfrican Union towards a negotiated settlement.In the Middle East  renewed escalation of theviolence may hamper current initiatives towards apeaceful settlement of the Palestine issue and thetermination of Arab-Israeli crisis. We urge the partiesto return to the negotiating table and to find a politicalsettlement that will serve the best interests of allpeoples living in the region and meet their securityrequirements.Last July  the African States established theAfrican Union as a more effective tool to help in theresolution of innumerable problems that are at the rootof underdevelopment  such as poverty  foreign debt lack of know-how and epidemics  among others. Ourpriority is to end the current economic stagnation inAfrica. The establishment of the New Partnership forAfrica's Development reflects the determination ofAfrican Governments to resolve the problems ofeconomic backwardness  poverty and social exclusionthat afflict the majority of their peoples and thecontinuing marginalization of Africa from internationalmarkets in terms of capital  services and goods. Angolahopes that the international community  especiallydonor nations  will lend Africa a helping hand byincreasing official development assistance on the basisof fair and non-discriminatory criteria.In closing  allow me to offer my heartycongratulations to Switzerland as it joins our family ofmembers of the United Nations."
"3",118,"ALB",57,2002,"﻿Allow me to extend my bestwishes to Mr. Kavan on the occasion of his election tothe office of President of the fifty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly  as well as to congratulate hispredecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for presiding withcompetence over the proceedings of the last session. Atthe same time  I take this opportunity to congratulatethe Swiss Confederation and East Timor on their newmembership in the United Nations. I would also like togreet the return of the United States of America to theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization  which we consider an important eventthat will contribute positively to the future activity ofthat Organization.During this year  Albania witnessed manypositive developments in the political  institutional andsocio-economic areas. The new climate of dialogue thathas recently prevailed in Albanian politics isencouraging the reforms aimed at accelerating thecountry's integration into Euro-Atlantic structures. Thepolitical and social stability of the country is beingconsolidated  thus creating the conditions for positivedevelopments in all fields. The continuousimprovements in democratic standards that characterizeAlbanian society today are a result of the reformsundertaken to strengthen the rule of law and thebuilding of new democratic institutions.In the process of implementing the commitmentsof the Millennium Summit Declaration  the AlbanianGovernment is taking the necessary measures tointegrate the Millennium Development Goals into itsnational development goals. The national strategy foreconomic and social development  drafted recently bythe Albanian Government  with the support of theWorld Bank  has appropriately accommodateddevelopment indicators from various fields to theMillennium Development Goals. We have the politicalwill to continue on the long and difficult road ofimplementing these objectives. We consider this to bean indispensable process for the country's sustainabledevelopment. Albania has already presented its reporton the implementation status of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.For these stated purposes  the AlbanianGovernment is undertaking an extensive campaigntargeting the State administration  civil society and thewhole of Albanian public opinion  with the purpose ofmaking them aware of their role in implementing theseobjectives. We highly appreciate the cooperation andsupport of the Secretariat  the Department of Economicand Social Affairs and the other specialized agencies ofthe United Nations in implementing these objectives.The Albanian Government has recentlyundertaken comprehensive action against thephenomena of illegal trafficking  smuggling  corruptionand abuse of power. Being at the crossroads betweenEast and West  Albanian territory has been an attractivevenue for local and international criminal activities andhas been exploited as a bridge for the trafficking ofhuman beings  drugs  arms and goods. The crises andconflicts that our region has been forced to experiencehave contributed to that desirability. To combat this the Albanian Government has made concretecommitments to end human and all other forms oftrafficking coming from  and going through  itsterritory by severely punishing perpetrators to the fullextent of the law  as well as by eliminating the causesthat create the conditions for such phenomena to takeplace.The political stability of the country has alsowitnessed very positive developments. The recentpresidential election  which has been conducted for thefirst time with the broad consensus of all parliamentaryparties  is further contributing to that stability. Theoverall reforms we are undertaking have had as theirpoint of reference the standards of the most developedWestern countries. The ultimate aim is the integrationof Albania into the Euro-Atlantic structures. Joiningthe European Union has been a permanent majorobjective of my country. The expected commencementthis fall of negotiations on the Stabilization andAssociation Agreement with the European Union willbe the best form of encouragement for thecomprehensive reforms being carried out in Albania.The whole Albanian political spectrum  including theGovernment and the opposition  is committed to theachievement of this target.Albania pays special attention to the Atlanticdimension of that integration. Our aspiration for fullmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) is in line with NATO's strategic interest instrengthening peace and stability in South-EasternEurope. We believe that the wider the geographicspread of this organization  the more secureinternational peace and stability will be. We hope thatthe ongoing fruitful partnership between Albania andNATO will be recognized and encouraged at the Praguesummit.8During the last few years  the region of South-Eastern Europe has experienced a new era of positivechanges. The new liberal mentality is significantlytaking hold in the consciences of the citizens of oursocieties. We are confident that this part of Europe willsoon become part of the European common future. But unfortunately  the traces of extreme nationalism andxenophobia that continue to exist remind us that wehave a long way to go before we are able to escape thepast and establish genuine democracy in our region.Albania is strongly convinced of the need to strengthenregional cooperation on the basis of the principles offriendly and good-neighbourly relations  respect forsovereignty and territorial integrity and the protectionof human rights and liberties.Albania has made a valuable and internationallyrecognized contribution towards the strengthening ofpeace and stability in the region. Strongly convincedthat Albania's internal stability is essential to thestability of other neighbourly countries in the region and after having completed our tasks at home  we havesought to promote throughout the region thephilosophy of co-existence and tolerance  instead ofthat of hatred and inter-ethnic and religious differences.With its vision towards the future  Albania has madeserious efforts towards the regional integration of thecountries of South-Eastern Europe on the basis of theEuropean Union model. We believe that this model ofreconciliation and cooperation  which was designedand implemented after the Second World War  is themodel that the Balkans should embrace and implementwith courage while leaving their bloody inter-ethnicconflicts behind.In that context of cooperation and integration  thefree movement of people  goods and capital throughoutour region should become a tangible reality for ourcountries and their citizens. We have to be aware thatwhat we have in common today  and what we will havein common in the future  is more important than thebitter heritage of past differences. This is thephilosophy of building on common values for acommon future.As stated two days ago in Kosovo by the ExternalRelations Commissioner of the European Union  ChrisPatten  Kosovo has undergone important changes thatcould not have been imagined three years ago. Thebuilding of self-governing democratic institutions inKosovo was a tremendous achievement by the peopleof Kosovo and the international organizations led bythe United Nations. The normal functioning of thoseinstitutions  with the participation and representation ofall its citizens  will create the necessary conditions forthe further normalization of political  economic andsocial life in Kosovo. It is our conviction that the localelection to be held this October will be conducted infull compliance with international standards and willcontribute further to the consolidation of institutionsand the democratization and Europianization ofKosovo.The Albanian Government hails the cooperationbetween the United Nations Interim AdministrationMission in Kosovo and Kosovo's elected institutions.We are convinced that those relations will be furtherstrengthened in the future to the benefit of all thecitizens of Kosovo.Albania supports Security Council resolution1244 (1999)  as well as the efforts and commitment ofthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General inKosovo  Mr. Michael Steiner.Albania views relations with Kosovo in thebroader perspective of regional stability  cooperationand integration. Albania encourages and supports astable and sustainable Kosovo as a constructive andcomplementary element of the region's stability andintegration. This means that Kosovo should be open inits relations  not only with Albania but also with Serbiaand all other countries of the region. Albania sees thefuture of Kosovo from the perspective of regional andEuropean integration processes. This future requiresdemocratic standards  such as the consolidation ofdemocratic institutions  the strengthening of the rule oflaw  the return of Serbs and the normal functioning of amulti-ethnic society there.The future status of Kosovo must simultaneouslysatisfy a number of elements and principles  such as theright of all its citizens to express themselves on theseand other matters regardless of their ethnicbackground; the will of the international community;and the need to guarantee the stability of Kosovo andthe region itself. The status of Kosovo depends on itsstability.In accordance with its long-term vision ofregional cooperation and European integration  Albaniahas committed itself to promoting further its relationswith the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The recentupgrading of those diplomatic relations to theambassadorial level and Albania's initiation of a9number of bilateral agreements are concrete examplesof that commitment.We welcome the recent democratic elections inthe Presheva valley  and we strongly believe that thoseelections will contribute to the strengthening ofstability in that region. The integration of Albaniansinto all levels of the central and local administrationsand the protection and respect of their rights will nodoubt bring positive developments to that area  toSerbia and to the region at large.The Albanian Government is interested indeveloping cooperative and good-neighbourly relationswith the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Wewelcome the democratic elections held recently in thatcountry. We look forward to the early creation of astable  long-term government  having as its majorobjective the full implementation of the OhridAgreement  the essential condition for the maintenanceof peace  stability and democracy and for thecontinuation of the reforms in our neighbouringrepublic.The European integration processes haveincreased the awareness of Albania and that of theother South-eastern European countries of the role andimportance of regional organizations and initiatives.They are efficient instruments that bring countriestogether  not only in the form of political cooperation but also by intertwining their interests in many fields such as trade  transport  culture and education.Fighting organized crime is another dimension ofsuch cooperation. In March  Albania successfullyconcluded its chairmanship of the South-East EuropeanCooperation Process  while in April it assumed thepresidency of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.We are confident that  during the meeting of theForeign Ministers of member States of the Black SeaEconomic Cooperation process  to be held in Tirana inOctober  the participating countries will reaffirm theirreadiness to strengthen their political and economiccooperation and to translate it into programmes andprojects.One year after the terrorist attacks of 11September 2001  our hearts still feel the pain of theloss of innocent lives. The endangering of peace freedom and democratic values — a challenge thatfaces all United Nations member countries — calls forthe creation of a unified front. Terrorism has become acommon enemy from which none of us is immune.Nevertheless  our determination to fight that enemy isresolute  and it gives us an opportunity to build a moresecure and more peaceful world.Albania was among the first countries to alignthemselves with the international coalition againstterrorism. This year  in compliance with SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  Albania has takenlegislative  executive and administrative actions tofight against that phenomenon. At present  Albania hasa complete legal framework that provides for thecontrol  investigation and punishment of potentialterrorist acts and of persons who are linked to orsupport such acts. Albania has become a party to the 12United Nations Conventions related to the fight againstterrorism. The Albanian Government has also takenaction to set up and strengthen specific State structuresto prevent and fight against terrorism. Those structuresare also responsible for and capable of offering fullcooperation on an international level.Albania has praised and supported the activity ofthe United Nations peacekeeping Mission inAfghanistan and is currently contributing troops to thatMission.We have followed with deep concern thedevelopments in the Middle East and the threat thatSaddam Hussein's regime poses to security  peace andglobal solidarity against State-backed terrorism. TheAlbanian Government reaffirms its position  whichdemands Iraq's full compliance with the relevantSecurity Council resolutions. Any hesitation orindecisiveness with regard to implementing UnitedNations decisions and resolutions concerning Iraqwould be a challenge to the international communityand could have grave consequences for peace andglobal security. We are convinced that  as PresidentBush said a few days ago in this Hall  we cannot standby and do nothing while dangers gather. We must standup for our security and for the permanent rights andhopes of mankind.Together with the entire international community the Albanian Government is following with concernthe escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ourposition is that a solution to that conflict can be foundthat will bring about a sustainable and lasting peace.Albania welcomes the steps taken by the internationalcommunity to bring peace and stability to the MiddleEast and expresses its confidence that both parties to10the conflict will join the international community in itsefforts to find a permanent solution.Our region faces many challenges that itscountries must confront together. The United Nationshas an important role to play in uniting the efforts ofindividual Members to create the necessary synergiesto deal with those challenges. Armed conflicts terrorism and international organized crime  poverty the violation of human rights  contagious diseases natural calamities and environmental pollution areproblems that require not only the commitment of allour countries  but also coordinated and efficient jointaction by the United Nations based on the principles ofthe Charter. The United Nations must strengthen itsrole in preventing and resolving conflicts as well as inensuring peace and stability. In that respect  itscooperation with regional security organizations shouldcontinue  based on the best examples of the past. Inpromoting peace and development  the United Nationsshould use more efficiently the available financialresources  aiming at their better management but alsoat tailoring its projects and programmes to the specificneeds of beneficiary countries.The Albanian Government welcomes andsupports the efforts of the Secretary-General to reformthe Organization and hence to enhance its efficiency.I should like to take this opportunity to thank theUnited Nations Department of Economic and SocialAffairs  the United Nations Development Programmeand the other specialized agencies of the Organizationfor their efforts to assist the Albanian Government inimplementing its development programmes andprojects.I would like to emphasize that this is a specialyear for the United Nations. Many important eventshave taken place in connection with such issues as therights of children  the ageing of populations  nutrition the fight against poverty and environmental protection.Albania has contributed to those events. On thisoccasion  on behalf of the Albanian Government  Iwould like to pay tribute to the outcomes andinitiatives of the Summit on Sustainable Development held at Johannesburg a few days ago. We are convincedthat the commitments undertaken by our countries inconnection with those initiatives will soon be embodiedin joint efforts aimed at creating a better world foreveryone."
"4",141,"AND",57,2002,"﻿First of all  may I congratulate President JanKavan  well known for his expertise in human rights on his election to preside over this General Assembly.My congratulations also go to the outgoing President Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his hard work  and I commendthe United Nations Secretary-General  Kofi Annan whose stewardship of the Organization in these tryingtimes is particularly admirable. I also congratulateSwitzerland on its admission to membership in theOrganization.This session of the General Assembly  more thanin recent years  seems caught between the past and thefuture — a tragic past  an uncertain future. In NewYork  and in the world  the catastrophe of the attacks of11 September seems so present with us that we feel itsimprint still upon us  as if our souls were marked bythe fall of the towers and the cruel loss of life. We feelthis past as a tangible  palpable weight  and we alsosense the future pressing in upon us.This past year  we have witnessed the war inAfghanistan  the fall of the Taliban and theestablishment of a new Government in Kabul. Willthere be intervention in Iraq  will there be more attacksin America  in Europe  or elsewhere? What will thefuture bring?I ask these questions as Foreign Minister of thePrincipality of Andorra. Andorra is a small andpeaceful country nestled in the protected valleys of thePyrenees. We have lived in peace for nearly a thousandyears. And yet we are not safe from the storms thatbuffet the world. Because of our small size  ourreliance on trade and our relations with our neighboursand the world — our diplomacy  if you will — are ofthe greatest importance to our well-being. As we turnto the world  so  too  the world turns to us in the tens ofmillions of tourists that visit us every year.Our industries  our citizens and our lives are asintimately linked to the world as to the mountains thatsurround us. This link was clear in the profoundsadness of our people over the loss of life in New York Washington and Pennsylvania. We felt it as a visceralblow  a spontaneous expression of true sympathy.The world surrounds us  although we often feelwe can do little to influence the course of events. Andyet what we do know is how actively to seek peace and thereby ensure our future. It is about the future  theidea of the future  that I wish to speak today.The future. In order to understand it  we mustlook not only to those events that are determining it that are forming it even as we speak  but also to its ownhistory as an idea. What is the history of the future?24Here I will only invoke  in passing  two earliermodels that 500 years ago embodied our understandingof the future: God's providence and the wheel ofFortune. In the providential model of the future  Godlooks down on the full history of the world from “thehigh citadel of eternity” in the words of ThomasAquinas. He sees everything  every grain of sand every sparrow that falls. “There is a special providencein the fall of a sparrow” Hamlet tells Laertes inShakespeare's great play. But alongside this Christianunderstanding of God's providence is another figure the pagan figure of Fortuna  who holds her wheel onwhich all men  king and commoner  rise and fall.Hamlet is also aware of her power; he is buffeted bythe slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune  and helongs to end his life  but he fears God's prohibitionagainst suicide. This very prohibition  shared by allthree of the great religions of the West  was broken bythe suicide attacks of 11 September. So  too  theprohibition that “thou shall not kill”. Life is precious: itis given to us  and we cannot take it away.In these two models of the future  humanity ispassive. We are puppets — God or Fortune pulls ourstrings. But gradually we drew away from this passiveenslavement to our fate  our destiny  and we struggledto master the future. The change in the future is firstheard in the writings of that first theorist of diplomacy the cunning Machiavelli. In The Prince  he wrote that aruler must learn to profit from chance  or rather turnchance to his favour. In a typically violent metaphor  hetells the Prince that Fortune must be beaten.Machiavelli counsels him to wrestle with fortune andthereby create the future.Although Machiavelli was advising an absolutemonarch  and indeed his thought presaged a longperiod of monarchical absolutism  he understood thatthe rulers and the administrators could no longer affordto be passive objects of history. They had to consider to think  to attack fortune; to hurl the slings and shootthe arrows back at her  if you will. In this shift  frompassive object to active agent  the idea of the futurebegins its transformation. In this future  Machievelli'sheirs — diplomats gathered here today — advise themodern princes  the democratically elected rulers of theworld  for the general good of the people.The future becomes an idea that we build throughstrategy  thought and action  through laws and treatieswe enter into and must obey. That is the very purposeof the United Nations  the great parliament of theworld's Governments  or in a less poetic but more aptimage  a great  international factory  in that it builds thefuture: a future  not for the wealthy or the powerful not for some nations  but for the world and its peoples.Out of the ruins of the Second World War  thenations of the world joined to create a better future forall humanity. The belief that binds us together is thebelief that together  only together  we can build a betterworld for all: a glorious city on the hill; a newJerusalem; a Jerusalem of all religions  all beliefs; acity of tolerance; a city very much like New York.That is why  I think  the terrorist attacks were sopainful  for New York City is very much an expressionof the United Nations  a place for all of the citizens ofthe world  all religions and all beliefs — the city oftolerance; a city that resolutely looks forward to thefuture; New York: city of dreams  city of the future.Strangely  even as New York was profoundlywounded by these attacks  no other city  I think  hasbeen so resolute in looking forward. The city was not nor is it  spoiled by revenge. New York always looks tothe future. While others may reproach the city for itsindifference to its past  its forward-looking optimism isperhaps its greatest gift to the world.So when we all saw in Andorra and elsewhere theattacks on the World Trade Center  my first responsewas that the suicide hijackers did not know New York.They did not know that this city has brought peoplefrom all countries together. They did not know thepeople who would die in the collapse of the towers:people from many of the religions and countries of theworld.But then I realized that perhaps they did know that perhaps New York was their target  and that theirtarget was the future. Or rather  their target was afuture of tolerance: religious  cultural  personal.Indeed  it seems that the terrorists longed for purity  fora pure vision of the future in which the tolerance — theimpurities — of New York would have no place.They believed  but not in the uncertain future ofNew York  the restless striving for the new. Theybelieved that with their deaths they would enterparadise of the afterlife. They believed  sacrilegiously that they were the means of God's providence.When the terrorists attacked America  they alsoattacked the future. They attacked the future oftolerance  a future controlled not by fate  but by25mankind. We cannot let our notion of the future fallwith the towers  for the future is as fragile as thetowers proved to be  perhaps more so. The future isbuilt not of steel and stone  but of law and humansympathy.In a way  I think  at least for the moment andperhaps necessarily  the terrorist attack on the futurehas damaged it. It demanded a strong response: themission in Afghanistan  the continued destruction of AlQaeda. That is the kind of response that theperpetrators of that violence would understand; aresponse that cannot be seen as a sign of weakness orvulnerability. It is a logical  and therefore necessary response that the terrorists themselves unleashed.But violence breeds violence  and the future ofviolence is simple destruction: nothing — and nothingwill come of nothing. We run the risk of entering anendless war against a shadowy enemy; a war that given the nature of the enemy  might prove very hard towin completely. And yet it must be won.Our first and strongest line of defence againstviolence is the rule of law  with diplomacy to enact it.The United States  founded on the rule of law and onrights for all  understands that. Andorra understandsthat  because without law we would not have survivedas a country for nearly a millennium.That is why Andorra believes in and supportsinternational law and trusts the United Nations particularly its democratic members  to lead the worldfrom its history of violence towards its common future.In relation to Iraq  Andorra supports the role of theUnited Nations  and we shall follow carefully thedebates in the Security Council.Terrorism is not a conventional war: there can beno treaties  no compacts  with terrorists. Law is vitalfor all countries  but terrorists do not care about laws.They are without a country and pose a particulardanger and challenge. In that sense  we must embarkon an aggressive reaching out to all people  anaggressive assertion of our common humanity. Thatmight well be a media campaign  although it needs tocome directly from all elected politicians and ministers.We are not trying to abstract issues or win a war ofwords. We need to pull everybody into the humancompact. We need to recognize our individualvulnerability.It was America's belief in its invulnerability thatwas so profoundly shaken by the terrorist attack. Yet ifthe sudden collapse of the towers and the fear andchaos of that day revealed a weakness  it also revealedstrength: the strength of its citizens' resolve and theprofound sympathy of all the peoples of the world.In the wake of 11 September we recognize boththe need for the rule of law and the cause of that need:the vulnerability of all people to malevolent attack. Themotto of Andorra is Virtus Unita Fortior  which can beloosely translated as “United We Stand”. That is notsimply an appeal to patriotism or for a common frontagainst the enemy. It is a recognition that togetherpeople are stronger  because alone we are weak andvulnerable.Nothing can justify the attack of 11 September2001. It is nevertheless important  here in the GeneralAssembly  to consider the roots of violence. Theterrorists turned their anger and alienation — political cultural  economic and personal — into an abstract actof inhuman cruelty whose “solution” was the attack onthe towers. Only in the cold world of abstraction doesthat attack symbolize anything beyond untoldsuffering. We need to pull violence back fromabstraction into the world of human conversation.If people feel excluded from the future  theiralienation gives them a mad and violent certainty. Wemust get to work to rebuild an inclusive and tolerantidea of the future  an idea that is all too easily forgottenin war  an idea of the future in which everybody isprotected from those who would destroy it  an idea ofthe future so strong that it includes those people whomight otherwise be tempted by the madness of playingGod.That future is premised on awareness  not of thestrength of the nuclear nations or of powerfuleconomies  but of the vulnerability of this compact andof individual nations large and small. We mustrecognize the power of our vulnerability  for in thisrecognition  we recover our strength  our vision of acommon future and the will to act together. It istogether that we will win the war against terrorism."
"5",186,"ARE",57,2002,"﻿I have the honour  on behalf of my country the United Arab Emirates  to extend to you  Sir  and toyour friendly country  the Czech Republic  ourcongratulations on your election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. Weare confident that your great skill and diplomaticexperience in international affairs will assist you inachieving the goals of this session. We wish you andthe members of the Bureau great success.I also would like to thank your predecessor Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his effective leadership duringthe previous session.I would like to take this opportunity to welcomeand congratulate the Swiss Confederation on becominga Member of the United Nations. We also look forwardto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste soonjoining the Organization  which will enhance itsuniversality.We would also like to express our appreciation tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his wiseleadership and his tireless efforts to enhance the role ofthe United Nations in maintaining peace  security andstability in the world.The States of the world are gathered here today atthe beginning of a new session of the GeneralAssembly  hopeful of reaching more effective andtransparent solutions to the world's problems  based onfairness and justice  and of establishing peace in theworld  which is experiencing instability and animbalance in international relations.In addition to civil and regional wars  more thanhalf of the world's population is suffering frompoverty  famine  epidemics and fatal diseases. Somecountries are still occupying the territory of others.This is creating tension and instability in many regionsof the world  which is endangering regional andinternational peace and security.14As the international community faces anincreasing number of challenges  we are becomingmore aware of the importance of complying with theprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and ofrespecting the sovereignty of international law inresolving  by peaceful means  disputes  conflict andinstances of occupation.In this age of globalization and rapiddevelopment in information and communicationtechnologies  the world has become a small village thatcan be reached from anywhere. The different interestsof the world's nations have become intertwined morethan ever. Thus the problems and sufferings of otherpeoples cannot be ignored because of geographicaldistances or differences of culture  civilization andbeliefs.The current events in the world prove  without adoubt  that the outcomes of conflicts and wars and theproblems of poverty  drug abuse and disease extendbeyond their geographical borders  reaching secureregions and threatening their stability. For that reason the establishment of international peace and security inthe world is the joint responsibility of all Governmentsand nations  of their public as well as privateinstitutions. The dire need for a global partnership working under the umbrella of the United Nations witha view to creating a comprehensive and calculatedstrategy that takes into consideration international law human and cultural values and people's needs andsuffering can never be overestimated.The United Arab Emirates is well aware of thestrategic importance of the Arabian Gulf region  and itis aware that the security of the Arabian Gulf cannot beseparated from international peace and security.Furthermore  the United Arab Emirates  guided by thewise leadership of His Highness Sheikh Zayed binSultan A1-Nahyan  the President of the country believes in solving disputes by peaceful means  basedon the principles of the United Nations Charter and theprovisions of international law. On that basis  theUnited Arab Emirates calls upon the Islamic Republicof Iran to solve the issue of its occupation of the threeislands  Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb  and Abu Moussa through bilateral talks or through the InternationalCourt of Justice. We also reaffirm that the United ArabEmirates has complete sovereignty over these threeislands  including their air space  their regional waters the continental shelf and the economic region related tothem  as they are an indivisible part of the United ArabEmirates.The United Arab Emirates has more than onceshown good will and a serious desire to reach apeaceful solution to the issue of the three islands. Thiswas done through two visits by his Highness  SheikhHamdan bin Zayed Al-Nahyan  representing theMinistry of Foreign Affairs  to Tehran  in addition tomutual visits made by the two parties. The United ArabEmirates hopes that those visits will contribute tobringing both parties closer and to reaching a peacefulsolution for the three islands. This will reinforce theprinciple of security and of regional and internationalpeace. In addition  it will affirm the principle ofdialogue  peaceful coexistence  trust and goodneighbourliness.We have witnessed  during this session  new andencouraging developments regarding the Iraqi issueand the security and stability of the region. The UnitedArab Emirates welcomes Iraq's acceptance of thereturn of the United Nations inspectors  inimplementation of the relevant Security Councilresolutions. This decision will spare Iraq and the regionuntold tragedies and catastrophes. We look forward toreal cooperation  one built on the United NationsCharter and international resolutions  in order to reachstability and cooperation among the States of theregion and to resolve all remaining problems thathinder trust  stability and collaboration among thedifferent parties. We call upon the internationalcommunity to support the Iraqi decision  to exertgreater efforts to solve the pending issues between Iraqand the United Nations  and to lift the sanctionsimposed on the Iraqi people and under which they havesuffered for 12 years. We welcome  furthermore  thepositive attitude expressed by Iraq towards returningthe Kuwaiti national archives and properties. We urgeit to show more goodwill and take more effective stepsby freeing the Kuwaiti prisoners of war and those ofthird countries  returning the rest of the Kuwaitiproperties  respecting the sovereignty of Kuwait andnot interfering in Kuwait's internal affairs.We also reiterate the United Arab Emirates'position with regard to the resolution adopted by theArab Summit in Beirut in March 2002. This resolutionrejects the use of force or the threat to use it  alongwith any military attack against Iraq. This positionaims to protect the region from another unnecessarywar. We reiterate  furthermore  the importance of15securing the sovereignty and territorial integrity ofIraq.The United Arab Emirates is very concernedabout the dangerous events in the occupied Palestinianterritories. We express our sympathy and solidaritywith the Palestinian people in their ordeal. We alsodenounce all acts of aggression committed by theoccupying Israeli forces  and we demand that theinternational community  in particular the largeinfluential countries  the United States of America andthe European Union  compel Israel to end immediatelyall acts of murder  destruction  closure anddisplacement of the Palestinian people.The United Arab Emirates renews its support ofthe right of the Palestinians to self-determination andthe establishment of their independent State  withJerusalem as its capital. Accordingly  we reaffirm oursupport of the Arab peace initiative that was endorsedat the Beirut Summit. This initiative comprises aprocess for a just and comprehensive settlement thatensures the rights of both parties. Such a position wasexpressed by United States President George W. Bushin a speech calling for the creation of a PalestinianState.We also call upon Israel to end its continuousviolations of the agreements it made within theframework of the peace process and to resume peacetalks in accordance with General Assembly andSecurity Council resolutions  in particular resolutions181 (1947)  242 (1967)  338 (1973)  1397 (2002)  and425 (1978). These call for Israel's withdrawal from thePalestinian occupied lands  including the city ofJerusalem  to the 1967 borders  from the Syrian GolanHeights to the line set before 4 June 1967 and from theLebanese Shabaa farms  and for the dismantling of allsettlements in occupied Palestinian and Arab lands andfor the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland.Maintaining peace and security in the MiddleEast and the Arabian Gulf region depends  to a greatextent  on applying a more comprehensive andtransparent concept that entails the removal of weaponsof mass destruction. The fact that Israel has theseweapons  including nuclear weapons  is a direct threatto regional and international security. Accordingly  weagain urge the international community and relevantinternational organizations to pressure Israel  by allmeans possible  to abandon its nuclear weapons and tosubject its nuclear facilities to the supervision of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency. This proposalaims to establish a nuclear-free zone  along with a zonethat is free of weapons of mass destruction  in theMiddle East and the Arabian Gulf  similar to otherregions in the world.The United Arab Emirates watches with greatconcern the escalation in tensions between India andPakistan. We call upon these two countries to deal withtheir disputes in a spirit of joint political responsibilitythat ensures the security of the region and the world.We ask them to resume bilateral negotiations to resolvetheir standing disputes peacefully in order to maintainregional and international peace and security.International terrorism is a direct threat to the stabilityof nations and to international peace and the worldeconomy. In denouncing all acts of terrorism regardless of their motives and sources  the UnitedArab Emirates reaffirms its commitment to relevantUnited Nations resolutions on terrorism. It renews itscall for an international conference on terrorism toreach a clear definition of terrorism based on theprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations andregional and international treaties  conventions andcovenants.Political and historical events have proven thateconomic deterioration  poverty  lack of water  debtsand foreign occupation pose dangerous threats to liferesources and the security of human beings. They are amain cause of conflicts  violence  ethnic cleansing andinstability. On that basis  the leaders of the worldinsisted  in the Plan of Implementation and the PoliticalDeclaration of the Johannesburg World Summit onSustainable Development  on the common anddifferentiated responsibility to solve these problemsand on the importance of providing the financialresources to achieve the goals of economic  social andenvironmental development to eradicate poverty  raisestandards of living and achieve global economicdevelopment.The United Arab Emirates calls on theGovernments of the developed countries to honour thecommitments they made in Johannesburg — especiallywith respect to the developing and least developedcountries  as specified in the recommendationsemanating from the Summit — and in particular thefinancial resolutions requiring the developed countriesto contribute 0.7 per cent of their national productionto help poor  developing States to implementdevelopment programmes in their countries.16We call upon Governments and relevantorganizations to comply with resolutions relevant tosustainable development. The United Arab Emirateshas consistently initiated and provided development financial and humanitarian assistance to manycountries  especially developing countries  that sufferfrom civil and regional wars and natural disasters. Wealso call upon the international financial institutions toadopt more balanced and fair financial policies toalleviate the developing countries' external debtburden. This would give them the opportunity toparticipate in formulating decision-making policiesrelevant to the environment and sustainabledevelopment and to help them join the global market thus reviving and enhancing their national economies.They would thereby become productive members ofthe international community  effectively promoting thestability of international economic relations.Finally  we hope that the debates on the items onthe agenda of this session will achieve positive andconcrete results  enhancing the role of the Organizationin maintaining international peace and security andmaking the world a better place for human society."
"6",233,"ARG",57,2002,"﻿First  I wish to congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourelection as President of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. Argentina welcomes the fact that adistinguished representative of the Czech Republic hasbeen given this distinction.The Argentine Republic rejoices with the UnitedNations at the entry of Switzerland as a new Memberof the Organization. The independence of East Timor the formation of its first sovereign Government and itscoming membership in the United Nations are theresult of the struggle of that country for its right to self-determination. We welcome this young nation that isnow incorporating into international life.Argentina wishes to express its special gratitudeto the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  fortranslating  through his actions and his continuingsearch for peace  the aspirations of the internationalcommunity striving to build a more secure and stableworld.26One year after the criminal terrorist attacks in theUnited States  we reiterate our solidarity with thepeople and the government of this friendly country  andwith the victims and their families. Terrorism is thechild of political or religious fanaticism. We areconvinced that international cooperation has to bestrengthened in the fight against any terrorist threat  soas to eliminate that threat  which endangers peace andinternational security  and ensure that those responsiblefor those attacks are tried and punished along withthose who help them and support them. There is nojustification  nor will there be any  for these barbaricactions that bring shame upon mankind.It is not a good thing when some Member Statesdo not abide by United Nations resolutions. It isintolerable that these resolutions remainunimplemented when issues related to the veryexistence of mankind on the planet are involved. Theexistence of arsenals with bacteriological  chemicaland other similar weapons that can be used in atraditional or terrorist war is a matter that affects allmen  women and children of the world.My country  along with the rest of theinternational community  has consistently called on theGovernment of Iraq to accept immediately andunconditionally the United Nations inspectors. Theseinspectors represent all of us inspecting one of us.There are no reasons to refuse the inspections if thereis nothing to conceal.Therefore  Argentina welcomes theannouncement made by the Secretary-General that Iraqfinally agreed to let the inspectors in withoutconditions. We hope that Iraq fulfils its promise ingood faith  and we very warmly congratulate theLeague of Arab States and the Secretary-General formaking this effort towards peace. The main concern atthe United Nations for peacekeeping and formaintaining international security has made significantstrides  even though some situations of extreme gravityand with high potential for conflict still exist and havenot been solved.The promising events related to the establishmentof the New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD) that we discussed yesterday  contrast withthe worsening situation in the Middle East. TheArgentine Government is following with pain and greatconcern the acts of violence in that region. We areconvinced that no possible solution will result from theindiscriminate and brutal use of force throughdeliberate assassinations or through terrorist attacksagainst civilians. The only road to peace and stability isthrough dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.Therefore we reiterate our position in support of therenewal of negotiations between the parties with thehope for coming to a peaceful  fair and definitivesolution to the conflict. This should include therecognition of the undeniable right of the Palestinianpeople to self-determination and to form anindependent State  as well as the legitimate right ofIsrael to live within secure and internationallyrecognized borders. At present  there are several plansfor peace in addition to the efforts on the part of theQuartet. All of these initiatives deserve our urgentattention.At this time  I wish to confirm that  as part ofArgentina's dedication to peace  and its desire tocontribute to a solution of the serious existingconflicts  our country will continue to provide armedforces and police personnel  as well as civilians  for thepeacekeeping operations established by the UnitedNations Security Council.We stress again the permanent commitment ofArgentine democracy to the international protection ofhuman rights and to the United Nations activities inthat field. We wish to mention our satisfaction at theentry into force of the Rome Statute  of whichArgentina is a founding party.Argentina today is going through an exceptionallydeep crisis. As for the opening of the country to theworld  our country will continue to travel along thepath of becoming a part of the concert of nations thatexchange goods and services  as it has doneuninterruptedly for the last 12 years. Therefore we willcontinue participating actively in multilateralnegotiations within the framework of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) and we will implement a newtrade policy  which  as part of an overall State policy will be aimed at giving the Argentine economy a clearexport profile. It is only by generating foreignearnings  as a result of international trade  that it willbe possible to have sustained economic growth overtime  while making it possible to repay our debts.The consolidation of this model demands accessto the currently restricted markets of developedcountries for Argentine products. The objective ofimproving access to markets in industrialized countries27was  during the Conference on Financing forDevelopment held in Monterrey  precisely the subjectof an absolute consensus  since this undertaking wasconsidered essential to eradicate poverty and to start onthe road to development.To bring prosperity to our peoples it is necessaryto see these initiatives enacted and not merelyconsidered as proposals. It is necessary for actions toconform  once and for all  to the principles that havebeen voiced and the commitments that have been made.It is of great importance that tariffs paid foragricultural products be reduced and  simultaneously that protection mechanisms and subsidies beeliminated. Such subsidies rose in 2000  within theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) countries rose to the staggeringfigure of 325 billion dollars with respect to agriculturalproducts alone. Of these  80 per cent were granted bythe United States  Japan and the European Union.It is essential then that the guidelines towards freetrade for agricultural products become a reality allowing the developing countries to stop calling foraid to help them deal with a specific problem  whichleads to a vicious circle. As a result  they only increasetheir already heavy and unbearable debt. They shouldbe allowed to sustain growth by selling their products.In other words  we wish trade rather than aid.The grave economic situation we are facing hasmade it difficult for us to fulfil our obligations to thisOrganization. These difficulties have been presented tothe Committee on Contributions  and we hope that itwill be adopted by the General Assembly  calling forunderstanding from countries that are friends ofArgentina.In an environment of acute economic and socialcrisis  the Government of the Argentine Republic hasreaffirmed its firm commitment  in national andinternational forums  towards the purposes and theprogrammatic principles of the InternationalConvention on the Rights of the Child. Thisinternational agreement  incorporated into our nationalconstitution  is included in the set of values and legalstandards that distinguish the Argentine nation.My country has clearly recognized the rights ofchildren from the time of conception  and stresses theimportance of the family in the child's development.Along these same lines we once again insist on theright of those children abducted by one of their parents.In particular  we refer to the painful situation of Karim Zahira and Sharif  the children of our compatriotGabriela Arias Uriburu. Unfortunately  despite hugeefforts on the part of the family and Argentine officials no answer has been given by the Kingdom of Jordan toour request for some mechanism that would makepossible a stable and permanent relationship betweenthese children and their mother. This position hasreceived the clear support of the meeting ofgovernment experts called by the General Assembly ofthe Organization of American States (OAS) inMontevideo  Uruguay.The Argentine Republic believes that theoutcomes of the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  recently held in Johannesburg constitutes a feasible agreement  upon which it ispossible to move forward in the implementation ofspecific actions in the economic  social  andenvironmental dimensions of sustainable development.I regret to say that the most important statementat that Summit was made by a group of children  whosaid: We ask ourselves whether snow will fall in themiddle of summer one day ' and More than words orapplause  we need actions.' Unfortunately  littlespecific progress has been made to stop the continuingseries of environmental disasters.As the General Assembly knows well  theArgentine Republic has a sovereignty dispute with theUnited Kingdom over the Malvinas and South Georgiaand the South Sandwich Islands  as well as thesurrounding maritime areas. The recovery of fullsovereignty over that part of our national territory while respecting the interests of the inhabitants andinternational law  is a precept enshrined in theArgentine Constitution. The issue was included in theprogramme of work of this Organization  which  inseveral resolutions  asked the Government of Argentinaand the Government of the United Kingdom to resumenegotiations to find a just and lasting solution to thesovereignty dispute  thus ending a colonial situationimposed by the use of force in 1833.Today  in line with that request  Argentina onceagain reaffirms its positive disposition to resumebilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom to finda solution to the question and its support of the goodoffices mission that the General Assembly entrusted tothe Secretary-General to assist the parties to achievethat goal.28Some three decades ago  in this same Hall  PopePaul VI declared from this same rostrum thatdevelopment is the new name of peace. That brief andwise sentence is fully valid today and points towardsthe path that we should follow."
"7",258,"ARM",57,2002,"﻿I would like to beginby congratulating you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventhsession  and to wish you success in your work. I wouldalso like to thank Mr. Han Seung-soo for having soably conducted the work of the fifty-sixth session.It is with special pleasure that I welcome theadmission of the Swiss Confederation to the UnitedNations. That we have the pleasure and the opportunityto welcome such a new Member — a long-standingdemocracy which has only recently chosen to enter thisforum — is continuing testimony to the vitality viability and relevance of this unique body.This time last year  new States and old werethunderstruck by a terror that is still indescribable. Wewere reeling from the enormity of what terrorism hadwrought  even as we sought to understand why it hadhappened. Millenniums of experience of thedevastation of war had not provided us with the toolsnecessary to understand that new form of combat.Today  a year later  as we persevere with thearduous endeavour to eradicate the affliction  we alsocontinue to search for causes. We distinguish  certainly between comprehending and concurring  awareness andacquiescence  understanding and justification. At thesame time  we recognize that diagnosis does not alwaysresult in a cure.We cannot go back to where we were a year ago either in our assumptions or in our actions. Thefundamental question we must all answer is: what is itthat we can and cannot  should and should not  do toother human beings? The answer must include arejection of flagrant injustice and abject poverty. Thatwould go a long way towards alleviating thehopelessness that perpetuates such societal ills.Bearing that in mind  we welcome the targets andtimetables adopted to spur action on a wide range ofissues at the recently concluded World Summit onSustainable Development. Critical among those goalsis the need to provide and manage water as a basicelement of life and a basic requirement for dignifiedliving. Without that  neither economic nor politicalstability is possible. The other two major UnitedNations events of this year — the InternationalConference on Financing for Development and thespecial Assembly session on children — alsodemonstrate that social and economic developmentmust be tackled in tandem in order to attain globalpeace and security.In Armenia  too  we are focusing on both aspectsof development. The Armenian Government's povertyreduction strategy aims to establish an umbrella for theformulation and implementation of sustainable humandevelopment strategies in areas damaged byearthquakes and conflict. We shall do that by buildingdomestic capacities for governance and by restoringsocial services in education and health  agriculturaldevelopment  reforestation and disaster preparedness.Armenia's response to the very special session onchildren is the elaboration and implementation of itsNational Plan of Action for Children. The NationalPlan of Action sets 10-year goals for the protection ofthe rights of the child  outlines principal strategies  andestablishes indicators and mechanisms for monitoringprogress towards the enumerated goals.The past decades of summits and forums on thevariety of social and economic ills that face modernsocieties have amply demonstrated that committedpartnerships are necessary for serious progress. Athome  Government and civil society must worktogether to implement the decisions of such forums but  at the global level  Governments and internationalagencies must also provide the resources and impetusfor their universal agendas.Economic prosperity hinges on internal  regionaland international stability. That stability  in turn depends on cooperation and goodwill. In our region despite the existence of various conflicts  we continueto be hopeful that democratic processes will create civilsocieties with responsible leaders committed to theresolution of political issues.In Armenia  we look forward to a year ofelections: presidential elections — the fourth held since7independence — will be followed by parliamentaryelections  which in turn will be followed by areferendum on constitutional reforms. We are proudthat we have had a working Constitution for more thanseven years  and that that Constitution has seen usthrough difficult periods without leading to domesticturmoil. Nevertheless  we recognize the need — as inany evolving society — to make some changes in orderto reflect more accurately our commitment tobecoming a society that respects the rule of law and therights of individuals.We are equally proud that the Armenians ofNagorny-Karabakh  in the midst of their ongoingstruggle for self-determination  have also completedanother presidential election cycle. Indeed  the peopleof Nagorny-Karabakh deserve to be commended forestablishing the rule of law despite continuing adversesocial and economic conditions.As the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe (OSCE) and the Co-Chairmen of its MinskGroup continue to work with Armenia  Azerbaijan andNagorny-Karabakh towards a settlement that willwisely — i.e. with an eye to the realities on theground — determine Nagorny-Karabakh's final status it is self-evident that only a democratically electedleadership that enjoys a popular mandate will be ableto participate actively and legitimately in the finalnegotiations that affect the status of its own people.With that in mind  in 1992  at the Helsinki Meeting ofthe Council of Ministers of the Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe  it was decided that electedand other representatives of Nagorny-Karabakh wouldbe invited to the Minsk Conference  entrusted withdetermining the final status of Nagorny-Karabakh.Therefore  while elections and democratizationdo not presume a particular status  self-determination isalways more legitimate when accompanied bydemocratic processes. The international communityseems to understand  often welcomes and sometimesassists in electoral democratic processes in areas whoseinternational legal status is still in flux and ostensiblysubject to the sovereignty of an existing State. We donot understand why such wise and non-prejudicialapproaches or strategies should be denied to Nagorny-Karabakh  where de facto self-rule has already been inplace for almost 10 years.Democratization and self-determination becomeboth necessary and inevitable when the formation of anew independent entity takes place inside States thatare deficient in democracy and whose respect forhuman rights and application of United Nationsprinciples is unsatisfactory. Nothing demonstrates thatfact more than East Timor's forthcoming membershipin this body. So it is with pleasure that we express tothat country the heartfelt congratulations of theArmenian Government. East Timor's comingmembership is proof that a blanket rejection of claimsto self-determination is invalid and does not take intoaccount the very real fact that such movements are not by their nature  all alike or even similar. Differentstruggles for self-determination have evolved indecidedly different ways; therefore  each has to betreated differently.The challenge for the international communitycontinues to be to adopt policies that will contribute tothe peaceful solution of each conflict. In order to adoptcorrect policies  criteria must be established by whichto evaluate and judge each case on its own merit realistically taking into account the real situation on theground in order to attain lasting peace.That peace is what the people of Nagorny-Karabakh and the whole region are still waiting for and one would think that it is also what the leadershipof Azerbaijan want. Based on the very hopefulmeetings that are taking place between the Presidentsof Armenia and Azerbaijan  we have reasons to bepositive. However  having followed the comments thatmy colleague from Azerbaijan made this morning fromthis podium  I am not only shocked but also dismayedthat he is not keeping pace with the progress beingmade in the region by the Presidents of both ourcountries.It has been two years since the meetings at Parisand Key West  where the international community putforth their views on this issue. Since then  someAzerbaijani officials  out of desperation or ignorance have used every means at their disposal to discredit theinitiatives of the international community  looking forways to artificially link them to the critical issues ofthe day.After 11 September  the talk of the threat ofinternational terrorism caused Azerbaijan to makeaccusations that went full circle in damaging its ownreputation when  according to Western sources Azerbaijan's own 10-year-long relationship withterrorists came to the surface and it was demonstrated8that Azerbaijan had indeed served as a regionalterrorist hub. So that did not work. Today  as theinternational community speaks of countries'responsibilities under Security Council resolutions Azerbaijan frivolously makes the same accusationagainst Armenia  without considering that Armenia hasdone exactly what the international communityexpected: it has used its good offices  with theleadership of Nagorny-Karabakh  to help find apeaceful solution to the conflict.Azerbaijan has a choice: continue with crudedelusional manipulation and naive wishful thinking andhope for a return to a historical military and politicalsituation that ended long ago  or join the internationalcommunity  through the good offices of the Co-Chairmen of the OSCE's Minsk Group  in order tocontinue in the difficult search for peace. The peopleon the ground on all sides have demonstrated theirreadiness for peace and for political and economicstability. Leaders at the highest level are maintainingthe honest dialogue that will chip away at politicalobstacles. We who are entrusted with transformingthose efforts and desires into a just peace mustapproach our task honestly and responsibly.Let me say that Nagorny-Karabakh has never ever been a part of independent Azerbaijan. Whetherwe consider history or geography  whether we adopt along-term political perspective or face the reality of thefacts on the ground  the men  women and children ofNagorny-Karabakh have earned the right to livepeacefully on their historic lands.I wish to take this opportunity to reiteratePresident Kocharian's statement before the GeneralAssembly two years ago with respect to working forthe recognition of the Armenian genocide andpreventing the repetition of such an atrocity. We extendour profound appreciation to all those Governments legislatures and international bodies that haverecognized the Armenian genocide and pledge ourcooperation to all those that are currently in the processof reaffirming the facts of that crime against humanity.As a signatory of the Convention on the Prevention andPunishment of the Crime of Genocide  the ArmenianGovernment places a high priority on the struggle toprevent future genocide and to stand up against allattempts to deny past genocide. We support allinitiatives that reinforce the international consensusbehind that landmark treaty.It is becoming clear that this millennium  too will not be violence-free. Today  when global peaceappears a distant hope  Armenia observes the volatilityin the Caucasus  the Middle East and elsewhere withtrepidation. To face such challenges  Armenia supportsproposals by the Secretary-General aimed at thestrengthening of the Organization so that it can facenew challenges in a more satisfactory way.Additionally  Armenia is in favour of more equitablerepresentation on the Security Council  as well as moretransparency in its activities.The situation in the Middle East  in Afghanistanand around Iraq remains a continuing example of theneed for a vibrant and strengthened United Nationsable to assert the will of the Organization'smembership and empowered with greater authority toimplement its decisions.As States and Governments continue to search fornew ways to deal with emerging internal conflicts andincreasingly complex interrelationships  Armenia is ofthe belief that the United Nations must stand for all theeasy-to-orate but difficult-to-deliver principles ofeconomic and political justice and equality amongpeoples. Given our uneven history and problematicgeography  it is no surprise that Armenia is an advocateof multilateralism and collective security. From thevantage point of a country with our resources andlimitations  we realize that peace is not possiblewithout social justice  sustainable development andrespect for the rights of all individuals and peoples inthe community of nations."
"8",291,"ATG",57,2002,"﻿Let meexpress my country's delight in having Mr. Jan Kavanpreside over this fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly. Antigua and Barbuda owes much to theCzech Republic and the adherents of the religious ideasof Jan Hus  the Moravians  who arrived in Antigua inthe mid-eighteenth century and administered to theslaves in a manner uncommon at that time. Withhumanity and audacity they provided education tochattel servants  which was certainly one of thefoundations that led to the development of a sturdy progressive  and optimistic people  who this yearcelebrate the twenty-first anniversary of successfulindependence.Let me also pay tribute to Mr. Kavan'spredecessor  His Excellency Han Seung-soo  whoguided the fifty-sixth session through a perilous period yet found time to formulate positions to streamline ourwork and enhance the functions of the President. I wishadditionally to welcome Switzerland into this body; weare mindful of the contributions it has made to ourendeavours over the many years that we wished that itwould become formally incorporated.On 18 June 2001 Antigua and Barbuda ratifiedthe Rome Statute for the International Criminal Courtand was most pleased when on 11 April 2002 ten Statessimultaneously deposited instruments of ratification which brought the number of States that had ratifiedthe Statute to 66  six more than was required to bring itinto force. The reality is that this has been achieved ata remarkably swift pace  demonstrating that theGovernments and peoples of the globe recognized theneed for the existence of such a body. My own countryfollowed the process of development closely andparticipated in many conferences  seminars andpreparatory commissions on the subject.The adoption of the Statute manifested arevolution in legal and moral attitudes toward some ofthe worst crimes on earth. Whereas many developingStates have suffered under the hard yoke ofglobalization  the International Criminal Court  with itsprinciples of justice and the rule of law in internationalaffairs represents a plus for the globalization process.Nonetheless  much work remains to be done inobtaining worldwide ratification of the Rome Statute ensuring that the Court will have the appropriatemechanisms in place to begin functioning as early aspossible and disseminating information to stakeholdersat the national and international levels about the ICC the Rome Statute and its supporting documents.The fears of some States concerning the operationof the Court when it is effectuated next year must beovercome. The Statute has sufficient checks andbalances to allay all fears  and we remain convincedthat the ICC will be a legitimate judicial institution toadequately judge individuals for war crimes  genocideand crimes against humanity. We reiterate ourconviction that this can be done while guaranteeingStates their rights  as they are protected from anyinterference by the Court if they pursue such crimes atthe national level  and that the prosecutor'sautonomous power is accompanied by guaranteesagainst using the Court for specious or politicallymotivated endeavours.Although we are thrilled at the pace ofdevelopment with regard to the Court  if we look closerit reveals the peripheral influence of Caribbean States.27It was Trinidad and Tobago that revived the idea of theICC 41 years after the idea was first discussed. But thespecific concerns that Trinidad and Tobago and otherCaribbean States advanced as reasons for creating theICC have been put on the back burner. We had pleadedfor a court that would try  and sentence  those involvedin the trans-shipment of narcotics  in carrying out actsof terrorism and in committing marine violations including those in our territorial waters. I am sure thatit is not lost on members that in 1989 we wereemphasizing the need for the proposed court to tryterrorists. The Court is an acknowledgement of that. Itemphasizes genocide  crimes against humanity and warcrimes — and we support this. Yet we remain akin toRalph Ellison's “invisible man”.During the previous session  there were threemajor meetings on what can broadly be classified asfinancing for development. At Doha  142 countriesagreed to launch the next round of World TradeOrganization negotiations. Once again developingcountries  particularly those with monocultures  foundthemselves stymied with regard to getting favourableterms for their agricultural products  but weresuccessful in convincing developed countries that itwas acceptable to override patents to stem publichealth crises such as HIV/AIDS. Developed nationsfeared that that would diminish the effectiveness of theAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of IntellectualProperty Rights and discourage pharmaceuticalresearch  but proponents of the change argued forciblyfrom the humanitarian perspective.Delegates from the developing countries left theconference hoping to get better results at Monterrey —a Conference whose title specifically referred tofinancing for development. Unfortunately  mostdecisions were made before the statements of the well-prepared delegates from both developed anddeveloping countries could be structurally evaluated.At Monterrey  there were repeated references byboth developed and developing countries to the factthat half of the world's population lived on less than $2a day. But to any objective observer  it was never clearfrom the pronouncements of the dominant countrieswhether they could best help by significantlyincreasing foreign aid or by more concretely targetingtheir assistance to make it more effective. Many of thedeveloping countries kept signalling that both measureswere necessary and should be undertaken.It appeared that women were particularlydisappointed with the Conference. The ExecutiveDirector of the United Nations Development Fund forWomen  Noeleen Heyzer  declared  “you cannot talkabout halving poverty without looking at thefeminization of poverty”. Heyzer was critical of thefact that the Conference was working with staticpoverty statistics. A member of her staff pointed outthat new ways of financing development had toconsider protecting domestic industries while preparingwomen to take advantage of new opportunities.Ms. Heyzer stated that the meeting should haveconsidered institutional and legal barriers to women'sadvancement  such as banking systems that did notlend to women  and customary laws which preventedfemale ownership of land.In reality  not only aid  but a completeoverhauling of the present unidimensional focus ofglobalization should have come out of Monterrey. Thegoals — halving the proportion of people living on lessthan $1 a day by 2015  accelerating the process ofproviding access by individuals to clean water  andensuring gender equity  particularly with regard toeducation — cannot be considered to have beenadequately dealt with by simply stating that aid fromthe developed world would increase from $50 billion to$100 billion.In addition  it must be recalled that only one thirdof the $50 billion is spent in poor countries  while thelevel of aid and the conditionalities attached to itmakes it difficult to spend the rest effectively. Thestringent conditions set by donors also have an impacton the sovereignty of developing nations. Thus jumping from $50 billion to $100 billion withoutrevamping existing measures of disbursal andimplementation will not have the desired effect.Fortunately  the developing countries  throughtheir perseverance  were able to receive greaterconsideration in Johannesburg. The recent WorldSummit on Sustainable Development represents thestrongest effort by the international community topromote sustainable development through the adoption as set out in the Summit's Plan of Implementation  ofsignificant and concrete commitments to improve thelives of people living in poverty and to reverse thecontinuing degradation of the global environment.As a small developing State  my country soughtto contribute to the overriding theme of the Summit:28the promotion of action. In this respect  we commendthe Summit for the major progress made in addressingsome of the most pressing concerns of small islanddeveloping States  namely  poverty and theenvironment  and welcome the commitments toincrease access to clean water and proper sanitationand to energy services; to improve health conditionsand agriculture  particularly in dry lands; and to betterprotect the world's biodiversity and ecosystems.However the Summit's failure to agree on a target datefor increasing the use of renewable energy was a majordisappointment to all small island developing States.The true test of the Summit's success will be inthe follow-up actions at all levels. While in and ofitself the Summit generated a sense of urgency commitments for action  and partnerships to achievemeasurable results  concerted activity must beundertaken. Antigua and Barbuda therefore calls on allactors to honour their commitments and undertake thenecessary actions to fight poverty and protect theenvironment through the implementation of theinternationally agreed development goals  includingthose contained in the General Assembly's MillenniumDeclaration and Agenda 21  adopted in Rio de Janeiroin 1992. This will require a significant increase infinancial resources  as elaborated in the MonterreyConsensus.Antigua and Barbuda has every intention ofadhering to the time allotment  but must of necessitytouch on a few other issues. Unfortunately  we mustrecall the threat of terrorism. We have been workingdiligently to fulfil the United Nations requirements inthat respect. We must  however  move ahead and planfor the future positively. We welcome the NewPartnership for Africa's Development and are eagerlyawaiting the entry of East Timor into this body.While welcoming East Timor  we must againexpress our deep dissatisfaction that a referendum hasnot been held in the Western Sahara. The question ofthe Western Sahara involves the right of self-determination  a fundamental principle of the UnitedNations. As long as the conflict remains  the regionalsecurity in a significant part of the Maghreb willremain at risk. Clearly  the success or failure of theUnited Nations will enhance or compromise thecredibility of the current international system.A small developing State  such as Antigua andBarbuda  cannot deliver a statement at the UnitedNations General Assembly without mentioning theimperfections of globalization and calling again formeaningful remedies. When we consider the presentthrust toward globalization  we once again see our lackof significance in the global scheme of operations.Clearly  globalization leads to the reduction of thesovereignty of States  with the weakest and thesmallest being the biggest losers. Sadly lacking in thearguments for globalization is mention of the need togive consideration to the pace  direction and content ofliberalization. We must bear in mind the differentlevels of development and the need to build up nationalcapabilities. There is much insistence on free trade forthe developing world and yet exemptions from freetrade are claimed for the industrialized countries.Protective devices are built in for farmers in thedominant economies. These include subsidies guaranteed markets  payments not to produce beyond acertain level in order to maintain means of processing and all of this is done under the most stringent ofguidelines.On the other hand  when former colonialcountries provide preferences to their previous coloniesfor investments  challenges are mounted through theWorld Trade Organization by multinational enterprises.All this is done with the clear knowledge that inmodern times there has never been free trade.Recently  the envoy of a very large country seeking the support of Antigua and Barbuda for hiscandidature to a major international committee  praisedour twin-island state for its prominence  rationality andobjectivity in international affairs. He went on to statethat small States are generally more objective inrecognizing which countries ought to have positions onmajor international bodies. This is  in his view  due tothe fact that small States can consider issues withouthaving to take into consideration the pressures fromlarge armies and the need to maintain internationalprominence. Consequently  small States view issuesfrom the perspective of how policies affect the entireglobe  of how there can be improvements for allpeople  and of what the consequences of certain actionswill be.It was an exchange that sobered and uplifted mefor an entire week. Yes  small States can contributemuch and have a significant role to play in the UnitedNations. But we need to be looked at and to be listenedto. We have much to contribute. We will continue to29speak out  to speak up  to advocate  to plead andentreat. We urge that we be fully recognized  for we arepositive  compassionate and forward-looking.I end by offering to you the motto of my country:“Each endeavouring: all achieving.”"
"9",338,"AUS",57,2002,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. Iam also pleased to welcome Switzerland as a newMember of the United Nations.Let me acknowledge also two other significantdevelopments: the establishment of the African Union and the creation of the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment. Both raise real hope for a new era ofpolitical stability and economic growth for Africa.We meet at this General Assembly in the shadowof the terrorist attacks on this great city one year ago.Those chilling events were an attack on the values ofthe great civilizations represented here today  valuesthat are central to the United Nations Charter and thisOrganization.We can take some comfort in knowing that theinternational community has responded  deliberatelyand resolutely  to international terrorism. The coalitionin the war against terrorism  led by the United Statesand joined by others  including Australia  hasaccomplished a great deal. The Al Qaeda network inAfghanistan has been disabled. The Taliban regime hasbeen defeated. Now the world is a safer and morehumane place.But terrorism cannot be stamped out by militaryeffort alone. Together we must choke off support financial and otherwise  for terrorism. We must stopthe patrons and bankrollers of the trade in terror  andtogether face this insidious threat. The decisiveresponse of the United Nations after 11 September embodied in Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) created a framework for Member States to join forcesin suppressing  prosecuting and punishing terrorist actsand terrorist financing.All Member States must implement thecommitments made in resolution 1373 (2001).Australia has strengthened its counter-terrorismlegislative and law enforcement framework. We areparty to 10 of the 12 anti-terrorism instruments andwill ratify another later this month. Australia is alsoassisting other countries in the Asia-Pacific region toimplement their obligations.We face another grave threat to internationalpeace and security  one that tests the very authority ofthe United Nations. For over a decade  Iraq has floutedlegally binding obligations to disclose and eradicate itsprogrammes for weapons of mass destruction. Iraq hasdefied United Nations resolutions  United Nationsinspections and United Nations sanctions  and it hasignored some 23 of the 27 United Nations obligationsimposed on it under 16 Security Council resolutions.The Secretary-General has been patient  flexible andassiduous in his efforts to get Iraq to comply withCouncil resolutions. But Iraq has refused to work withthe United Nations in efforts to dismantle itsprogrammes for weapons of mass destruction.Until this occurs  Iraq is a grave threat to itsneighbours and to the world. Iraq's well documentedaggression towards its neighbours and its past use ofchemical weapons underline the potency of the threat itposes. Grave concerns remain about Iraq's presentcapabilities.Up until 1998 United Nations weapons inspectorsdid much good work in finding and destroying Iraq'sweapons of mass destruction program. But the work ofthe United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)was never finished  because in 1998 the inspectorswere effectively thrown out of Iraq. Four years later there is little doubt that Iraq has been working hard torebuild its chemical and biological weaponsprogrammes. Moreover  serious questions also remainabout Iraq's nuclear weapons programme.This state of affairs cannot be left unresolved.Iraq must give immediate  unconditional andunrestricted access to inspectors to all areas  facilities equipment  records and Iraqi officials. In short  Iraqmust fulfil the requirements of all relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions. If Iraq has nothing to hide  then ithas nothing to fear. Indeed  by meeting these demands Iraq and its people have everything to gain.Let us also be very clear: Iraq's flagrant andpersistent defiance is a direct challenge to the UnitedNations  to the authority of the Security Council  tointernational law  and to the will of the internationalcommunity.We cannot stand by and allow ourselves to beignored. Nor must protracted negotiations be allowedto weaken and eventually paralyse efforts to allay fearsabout Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. We all mustdemonstrate a clear  collective determination to upholdthe authority of the Security Council  and to ensure thatits resolutions on Iraq are implemented in full.Otherwise  if Iraq's pursuit of these abhorrent weaponsis allowed to continue  we may shortly be askingourselves why we failed to act.The terrorist threat has given new urgency to ourdisarmament and non-proliferation goals  and putsdemands on us for a renewed effort to stop the spreadof weapons of mass destruction  both to non-state25and state actors. We have to be alive to the willingnessof terrorist groups to develop and use chemical biological or nuclear weapons.Australia  for its part  intends to pursue practicaland effective measures through international non-proliferation treaty regimes and export-controlarrangements. These regimes and arrangements havedelivered tangible security benefits  and should besupported strongly.We also need to deal with other transnationalchallenges: not just terrorism but other transnationalcrimes  including the smuggling of arms  drugs andpeople.Transnational crimes threaten all countries. Theyrequire us to cooperate further in law enforcement intelligence and financial controls  much like the waron terrorism.People-smuggling and trafficking  in particular are a truly transnational problem. This lucrativecriminal enterprise undermines the internationalrefugee protection system  and legal migrationprograms  that have enabled millions to build new andprosperous lives in countries like Australia. Combatingpeople-smuggling and trafficking in persons isparticularly important to Australia and to the Asia-Pacific region. This year  Australia co-hosted aregional ministerial conference with Indonesia.Ministers from thirty-eight countries committedthemselves to stopping the people who deal cold-heartedly in human cargo. We agreed that  in the firstinstance  people-smuggling must be legislated againstas a serious crime. There is much more we need to do and Australia welcomes international discussion andaction on the issue  including within the UnitedNations system itself.Australia welcomes the addition of theInternational Criminal Court to the international legalframework. It is an example of positive internationalcooperation which will complement the efforts ofStates to end impunity for the worst violations ofinternational humanitarian law.United Nations work in East Timor is anotheroutstanding example of how the organization can  anddoes  make a difference  in this case in response to ahumanitarian crisis. In May we celebrated East Timor'sindependence. We are now about to welcome EastTimor as a new member of the United Nations. That wehave arrived at this point owes much to the resolve andcourage of the East Timorese. It owes much also to theUnited Nations and United Nations authorized missionsthat brought stability and order and renewed hope forthe future.I congratulate the Secretary-General and theSecurity Council for providing the United NationsMission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) with thenecessary support  not just for peacekeeping andpolicing  but also for developing stable governance inEast Timor. Sustained United Nations and internationalsupport will be critical in East Timor's formative years.Australia is determined to provide such support. Iwould like to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello'sefforts in East Timor  and to congratulate him warmlyon his appointment as United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights.HIV/AIDS is a global issue that tears at the fabricof our society  and threatens the economic developmentof entire continents. The United Nations GeneralAssembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS in June lastyear brought home to Member States theirresponsibilities to marshal national and regionalresponses to HIV/AIDS. Australia hosted a regionalministerial meeting in Melbourne in October 2001.Ministers agreed on the need to develop strategies tofight HIV/AIDS  and on the need to share lessons andcooperate in priority areas. We helped establish theAsia-Pacific Leadership Forum on HIV/AIDS andDevelopment to engender greater cooperation in theregion  and we applaud the appointment of a UnitedNations regional envoy for HIV/AIDS.The United Nations has a heavy agenda. But itcannot  and should not  try to do everything. Tomake a difference it must be selective and focused matching its activities to its capabilities and to thepriorities that we  the Member States  set for it. TheMillennium Declaration gave us clear  agreedpriorities. And the Monterrey Financing forDevelopment Conference and the JohannesburgSummit on Sustainable Development have built onthese  giving us a framework to shape and direct ourwork. We also need to revitalize and reform the way inwhich the key organs of the Organization  theGeneral Assembly  the Economic and Social Council the Security Council  function. The SecurityCouncil  in particular  should be reformed  including byexpanding its membership.26We also need to think again about the relationshipbetween these organs and the Secretariat: time is not afree good  nor are meeting services  nor are theSecretary-General's reports  and nor is the capacity orwill of Member States to provide resources withoutlimits. We need to look at how we can more effectivelyuse existing Unite Nations mechanisms  particularlythe General Assembly and the United NationsEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC)  as bodiesof review. And we are especially concerned that majorUnited Nations conferences have become so large andunwieldy that their fundamental purposes have beenobscured.Australia strongly supports the process of reformproposed by the Secretary-General for his second term.This provides a unique opportunity to address thesequestions and to `re-tool' the Organization so as tobuild on its strengths. As Member States  we are theUnited Nations. The Organization is there to serve ourcollective interests.In order to address new threats and challenges the United Nations must be focused and responsive and its key organs must function efficiently andeffectively. We must continue to work together toenable it to meet our expectations. I am confidentthat  together  we can achieve success."
"10",385,"AUT",57,2002,"﻿Let me beginby welcoming Switzerland  our western neighbour  as afull member of the United Nations and her firstparticipation in the General Assembly after heraccession. Without our Swiss friends the UnitedNations would not be complete. Expanding the globalreach of the United Nations can be seen as a positiveaspect of globalization.Having supported United Nations efforts to bringabout a solution to the East Timor conflict for manyyears  Austria also looks forward to 27 September andwishes to congratulate East Timor on becoming the191st Member of the United Nations.Austria fully aligns itself with the statement madeby the Prime Minister of Denmark on behalf of theEuropean Union. I should like to add a fewobservations to that very comprehensive statement.Let me reiterate the sympathy of the Austrianpeople for the victims of 11 September 2001. Austriahas shown strong solidarity from the first hour after theattacks and has acted in unison with her Europeanpartners and the United Nations to combat terrorism —a resolve that remains strong and will continue to doso.As a former staff member of the United Nations  Iwish to convey my country's sincere gratitude to themany dedicated people who are in the service of theUnited Nations in New York and at the otherheadquarters in Vienna and Geneva  as well as outthere in the field  for their efforts on behalf of theinternational community in its fight against terror.Combating terrorism requires a global effort anda comprehensive approach: prevention and theprotection of the security of our countries and of thebasic values of freedom and human rights  as well ascoercive measures as a last resort. We must  however base our decisions and actions on international law.The Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee(CTC) under the very able leadership of Sir JeremyGreenstock  Ambassador of the United Kingdom  is atthe core of the United Nations coordinating role.We must ensure that all States join and can jointhose efforts. To promote that goal  Austria hosted asymposium on combating international terrorism at theVienna International Centre in June of this year  whichhighlighted the capacity of the Vienna-based UnitedNations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention(ODCCP) to provide efficient technical assistance toMember States in their fight against terrorism. Austriawill make an additional million euros available for thestrengthening of the ODCCP.I am glad to note that Secretary-General KofiAnnan shares our view on the importance of theVienna-based United Nations units  as expressed in hisreport on the need to strengthen the TerrorismPrevention Branch of the Secretariat. The report ofPolicy Working Group on the United Nations andTerrorism published earlier this week comes to thesame conclusion. I therefore call upon the MemberStates to support that position.It is also important to remind ourselves that thefight against terrorism cannot be fought with soldiersand policemen alone; we also need to fight the rootcauses: the abject levels of poverty  inequality 16injustice  the lack of sustainable development and ofgood governance.When it comes to dangers for world security  wealso have to focus on unresolved and perilous regionalconflicts  such as in the Middle East. What is needed isan effort to speedily arrive at a political solutionproviding for two States  Israel and Palestine  withinsecure and recognized borders. Austria seconds theidea of an early international conference with thesupport of the Quartet and interested countries of theregion aimed at finding solutions to the political issuessuch as the final borders of the two States  the finalstatus of Jerusalem and the question of refugees.Austria considers the newly designed road map of theEuropean Union towards the establishment of anindependent and sovereign Palestinian State in the nextthree years to be a good basis for achieving a final andcomprehensive settlement of the conflict in accordancewith Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973) and 1397 (2002)  taking into consideration theArab peace plan adopted in Beirut as well.While continuing to respect the elected leadershipof the Palestinian people the European Union hasexpressed its readiness to give all necessary andpossible support to the reform process of thePalestinian Authority. Austria participates actively inthose efforts. Austria is also deeply concerned thathuman suffering in the conflict has attainedunacceptable levels  be it as a result of terror or ofcountermeasures.The Middle East has also garnered the attentionof the international community in the context of thedanger of the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. The growing tensions result from thecontinued non-compliance with United NationsSecurity Council resolutions on the part of Iraq. Thepotential threat of weapons of mass destructionendangering world peace through such policies shouldnot and cannot be tolerated. For that reason Austriasupports the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General tobring about the speedy  unfettered and unconditionalreturn of United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq along with full compliance with the obligationscontained in all relevant Security Council resolutions.Austria welcomes the statement of PresidentGeorge Bush seeking broad international andmultilateral support and cooperation with the SecurityCouncil on the issue of how to deal with the threatemanating from regimes that support terror or seek toacquire weapons of mass destruction. Only the SecurityCouncil can provide the legitimacy we need. At thesame time  it is evident that the Security Council itselfhas to take responsibility for ensuring full compliancewith its resolutions in order to maintain world peace.The conflict between India and Pakistan over theissue of Kashmir also needs an urgent politicalsolution. The consequences of an escalation could becatastrophic for the region and beyond.In recent weeks  we have been starkly remindedof the fact that Afghanistan  which has been wrestedfrom Taliban and Al Qaeda rule and has had apromising new start with the assistance of theinternational community  has yet to achieve a lastingpeace and stability. The international communityshould remain committed and has to continue itssupport of the new Government of Afghanistan.The fight against terrorism and violentfundamentalism in Afghanistan has also highlighted theimportance of the whole region of Central Asia. Duringits chairmanship of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe in 2000  Austria made it apriority to draw the attention of world opinion to theunresolved issues and problems and to the veryimpressive potential of that region given mutuallyuseful cooperation and good governance.Turning to our own neighbourhood  I want toreiterate the importance Austria attributes to EuropeanUnion enlargement and our firm commitment tofinalizing the ongoing negotiating process towards theend of this year. Austria looks forward to welcomingnew members by 2004  thus turning the vision of aunited Europe into reality and extending the Europeanzone of peace  stability and welfare to the wholecontinent and beyond.I am glad to note that South-Eastern Europe hasmade substantial progress towards stability generatedby various multilateral initiatives  particularly theStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe and the Zagrebprocess. As an additional instrument for enhancingdevelopment in that region  in May of this year theDanube Cooperation Project was launched in Vienna the aim of which is to make use of the Danube River asan integrative factor connecting the 13 countries of thewhole Danube basin.17The dialogue among civilizations  which Austriahas strongly supported from the beginning  is a newand important tool of diplomacy that should help usdrain the breeding grounds of terrorism. In order totake this dialogue from the elites to the general public we need to cooperate with the media. To that end  Iorganized an expert seminar on the role of the media inthe framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnershipin June of this year. This effort is designed to lead hopefully  to a media code of conduct to emanate fromthe media themselves in order to create betterunderstanding between the cultures and commonly toproject messages shedding a positive light on culturaldiversity.As of July of this year  Austria has chaired theHuman Security Network  the only interregionalgrouping in the United Nations framework particularlypropelling issues of human security. In my capacity asChairperson of that group  I have put the following twoissues at the top of our agenda: the needs for a globallyshared acquisition of a human rights culture throughhuman rights education and for effectively addressingthe terrible plight suffered by an ever-growing numberof children in the world exposed to the horrors ofarmed conflict. The first “human rights city” in Europe the Austrian city of Graz  will also host next year'sministerial meeting of the Human Security Network. Inthis context I should also like to express Austria'sstrong support for the adoption of the draft protocol ofthe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.In my function as President of the HumanSecurity Network  I have also taken the initiative  inthe framework of the group of female foreignministers  to raise the issue of Amina Lawal in acommon letter to the Foreign Minister of Nigeria inorder to remind Nigeria of its obligations underinternational human rights law.In the Millennium Declaration  we set cleartargets for our combined development efforts asMember States. We all did this in recognition of thepriority attached to the fight against poverty and for abetter and more equitable world. Disastrous floods inparts of Central Europe  including my own country  inAsia and the Americas  as well as droughts in otherparts of the world just before the start of the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg were a painful indication of changes renderingsustainable development even more important. TheSummit brought about an action programme and apolitical declaration  which we welcome  although wewould have wished to take some issues even further such as in the field of renewable energy. I share theview of the Secretary-General that the Summit hasinstigated global action among a wide range of actors.It has highlighted the relationship between economy ecology  social issues and development. It has alsoreaffirmed the Doha and Monterrey compromises.The follow-up will have to cut through thecomplexities of the process and to pursue the mostpressing issues. Implementation is the key word. Thiswill be best accomplished by sectoral conferences onthe major issues involved. Austria appreciates that theSummit has helped convince some major countries tojoin the ranks of those  such as Austria  that havealready ratified the Kyoto Protocol.Before closing  let me express my best wishes fora successful session of the Assembly underMr. Kavan's guidance and allow me also to thank hispredecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his leadership andhis efforts towards strengthening the GeneralAssembly.Having returned deeply impressed from SouthAfrica  let me close by quoting a real hero and a manwho stands for his principles while promotingreconciliation — Mr. Nelson Mandela. The followingquote is from the entrance to the Apartheid Museum inJohannesburg  which I just visited: “To be free is notmerely to put off one's chains  but to live in a way thatrespects and enhances the freedom of others.”"
"11",410,"AZE",57,2002,"﻿I should like first ofall to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his assumption ofthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session  and to express gratitude to Mr. HanSeung-soo for his efforts as President during the fifty-sixth session.I also have pleasure in congratulating Switzerlandon becoming a Member State.The United Nations  which is called upon to playa leading role in ensuring international peace andsecurity  is currently undertaking a serious examinationof its ability to unify the efforts of Member States andto organize efficient international cooperation inconfronting threats and risks that have a globaldimension.The tragic events that occurred in New York oneyear ago made all of us look at the world in a new wayand recognize the global interdependence of thechallenges of the new era. We must recognize that theworld itself has enabled the monster of terrorism todevelop by ignoring problems  turning a blind eye toviolations of the norms of international law  toleratingaggression and failing to respond to threats caused bythe illegal actions of some States  by separatism and bythe proliferation of weapons. It is necessary for us tolearn lessons from the mistakes made and to launch abroad offensive against terrorism on the basis ofcommon approaches.Respect for a universal approach that does notpermit inconsistency  selectiveness or double standardsis an indispensable condition for global solidarity inconfronting terrorism. The legal basis of such anapproach must be set out in a comprehensiveconvention to combat terrorism. No political  social ideological  religious or other reason can justify any ofthe acts  methods or practices of terrorism. Effectivelycounteracting terrorism and achieving its totaleradication demand the use of the broadest  mostcomplex approach  taking into consideration thevarious aspects of the problem and its root causes.It is obvious that terrorist groups recruit newmembers and flourish most easily in an environmentcharacterized by economic and social degradation armed conflict  poverty  illiteracy and self-isolation.The necessary resources should be mobilized to openup new programmes of assistance to the developingand less developed countries  and to expand existingprogrammes. The implementation of United Nations26decisions on assistance for the sustainable developmentand relaunching of economic growth in those countriesplays a major role. We need to take special note of theneed to render urgent international assistance toAfghanistan.Another important aspect in the eradication ofterrorism is the avoidance of inter-civilizationaltensions and the creation of a spirit of mutual respectamong religions and cultures. We support the trendtowards continuing and deepening the dialogue amongcivilizations  and we stress its multifaceted nature. Webelieve that the implementation of programmes in thefields of education  information and cultural dialogueamong civilizations will facilitate the creation ofrelations of mutual understanding and trust  which areso greatly needed in order to resolve the commonproblems faced by both the West and the East.In this context  I would like to stress in particularthe importance of the international conference initiatedby Azerbaijan on “The Role of Religion and Belief in aDemocratic Society: Searching for Ways to CombatTerrorism and Extremism”  to be held in cooperationwith the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE) on 10 and 11 October 2002 in Baku.In the combat against international terrorism priority should be given to addressing militantnationalism and aggressive separatism. Very oftenterrorist groups of separatists and nationalists ofvarious kinds maintain close ties among each other andare directly sponsored by States. The fight againstterrorism represents an extremely complex problem inthe so-called uncontrolled territories that have emergedas a result of armed separatism and foreign aggression.For 10 years now such an uncontrolled zone hasexisted in that part of the territory of Azerbaijanoccupied by Armenia. Elevating the ideology ofaggressive nationalism  terrorism and territorial claimsto neighbours to the rank of State policy  the Republicof Armenia  through direct interference in the internalaffairs of Azerbaijan  formed an armed separatistterrorist group within the Nagorno-Karabakh region ofthe Republic of Azerbaijan. This was followed byopen  armed aggression by Armenia againstAzerbaijan.Armenia  which perpetrated ethnic cleansingagainst the Azerbaijani people in their own territory in1987 and 1988  in 1992 and 1993 occupied the entireNagorno-Karabakh region  expelling 60 000 nativeAzerbaijani people. It has also occupied the territoriesof another seven regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan thus bringing the total number of Azerbaijani refugeesto 1 million. Armenia now intends to consolidate theresults of its aggression and ethnic cleansing and totear away the Nagorno-Karabakh region fromAzerbaijan.Armenia has tried to camouflage its annexationistpolicy by appealing to the principle of the right ofpeoples to self-determination. However  according tointernational law  this principle can be realized only ina peaceful way and in accordance with the principle ofterritorial integrity. The right to self-determinationdoes not imply the unilateral right of secession andshould not lead to the disintegration of a sovereign andindependent State.Furthermore  the Armenians residing in theNagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic ofAzerbaijan can in no way be regarded as independentsubjects with the right to self-determination.The assertion of the Armenian side that theNagorno-Karabakh region has never belonged toAzerbaijan is equally groundless  as is its reference tointernational law. Aside from the fact that appealing tohistory in the context of the settlement of inter-Stateconflicts is wrong  extremely dangerous and calls intoquestion the universality of the norms of theinternational law  it must be noted that these statementsby Armenia are refuted by numerous historical officialdocuments.Armenia  which often refers to the League ofNations to justify its territorial claims  must rememberthat  in its official documents  the League of Nationsexpressed doubt as to the existence of a stablegovernment capable of representing Armenia and  whatis most important  certified Armenia's lack of clearlydefined borders.The decisions of Armenia's Parliament on thereunification of the Nagorno-Karabakh region withArmenia and on the non-recognition of anyinternational document which mentions this region asan integral part of Azerbaijan are illegal. Likewise  thedecisions taken by the illegal separatist regime in theNagorno-Karabakh region  the so-called referendumsand elections it held in a situation of war and theforcible expulsion of the entire Azerbaijani populationcannot have any international legal validity.27Furthermore  Armenia itself has violated the rightof the Azerbaijani people to self-determination. Inaccordance with the universally recognizedinternational legal doctrine uti possidetis juris  formerUnion republics are recognized as new independentStates within borders previously existing within thefederations. These were the exact borders within whichthe United Nations recognized Azerbaijan in March1992  when it accepted our country as a fully fledgedMember of this universal Organization.In 1993 the Security Council adopted resolutions822 (1993)  853 (1993)  874 (1993) and 884 (1993) onthe Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. These resolutionswere adopted following each new stage of Armenianaggression against Azerbaijan. The Councilunambiguously supported the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan confirmed its recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as anintegral part of the Republic of Azerbaijan  andresolutely demanded the immediate  full andunconditional withdrawal of the Armenian forces fromthe occupied territories of Azerbaijan and the creationof conditions for the return of refugees and displacedpersons. However  these demands by the SecurityCouncil have so far not been implemented.Those resolutions also contained a request to theSecretary-General  the OSCE Chairman-in-Office andthe Chairman of the Minsk Group  to submit  inimplementing the mandate for the settlement ofArmenian-Azerbaijani conflict  reports on the situationin the region to the Security Council. The last decisionstressed the request to provide information on theprocess of the implementation of all four resolutions.Regrettably  this request still remains on paper only.Such a state of affairs cannot be beneficial for us; itleads to the “discharging” of the settlement processand  eventually  to a freezing of the situation at adangerous point of fait accompli of the occupation. Thenon-implementation of Security Council resolutionsundermines its authority as well as people's belief injustice and in the possibility of a peaceful politicalsettlement.As is well known  in the annual resolution of theGeneral Assembly on cooperation with the OSCE  theUnited Nations expresses its support for the efforts ofthe regional organization and its Minsk Group  whichmediates the settlement of the conflict in and aroundthe Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic ofAzerbaijan.How can we evaluate these decade-long efforts which have been under way since the establishment ofthe Minsk Group at the Conference on Security andCooperation (CSCE) Ministerial Council held inHelsinki in March 1992? While at the early stages ofthe mediation the Minsk Group was putting forwardproposals on the elimination of the consequences of theconflict  its present activities can be characterized asfollowing a “wait-and-see” policy against thebackground of the negotiations  until the victimizedparty accepts the conditions of the aggressor.Such a position on the part of the mediators canbe regarded only as passive support for Armenia's fait-accompli policy  which is unacceptable to us.Azerbaijan  which remains committed to apeaceful settlement of the conflict and to interactionwith the OSCE and its Minsk Group  sees an urgentneed for a new and resolute intervention by theSecurity Council  which so far has not used itspotential effectively to contribute to the settlement ofthe Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.The current situation is explosive. Yes  theceasefire has been observed for eight years andmediation activity is being maintained  but a realpeaceful settlement of the conflict has not occurred.Azerbaijan will never agree to the legalization ofterritorial seizures. Azerbaijan will never accept theloss of a single inch of its territory and preserves itsright to undertake all the necessary measures stipulatedby the United Nations Charter to protect its sovereigntyand territorial integrity.We call upon the Security Council to review theexisting situation  to make Armenia immediatelywithdraw its armed forces from the occupied territoriesof Azerbaijan and to engage in negotiations on definingthe status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region withinAzerbaijan on the basis of the norms and principles ofinternational law. We call upon the Republic ofArmenia to heed the voice of reason and abandon itspernicious policy of territorial claims againstAzerbaijan. The continuation of the occupation ofAzerbaijani lands and confrontation with Azerbaijanwill yield the Armenian people nothing but misfortuneand suffering.The conflict not only substantially underminessecurity in the South Caucasus region  but alsoconstitutes a major obstacle to establishing bilateraland regional cooperation. This cooperation would have28provided benefits to all States in the region and playeda crucial role in strengthening their positions andprestige in the international arena.Making use of its natural resources andfavourable geographic location  Azerbaijan contributesimmensely to the development of the South Caucasusregion and in fact plays the role of engine in itsintegration into the world system. According to datareleased last year by the Statistical Office of theEuropean Communities  52 per cent of the grossproduct of the countries of the South Caucasus wasproduced in Azerbaijan. A significant event  reachingfar beyond the South Caucasus borders  will take placein three days: the ground-breaking ceremony of theBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline  the construction ofwhich will give rise to a vast investment flow into theeconomies of the countries.Armenia  by its actions against Azerbaijan  hasisolated itself from participation in this kind ofeconomic project. Yes  at every level Armenia declaresits willingness to cooperate with Azerbaijan  but inArmenia's understanding  Azerbaijan must turn a blindeye to the occupation of its territories and establisheconomic relations with Armenia. I think members willagree that hardly anyone could accept such asuggestion  which in fact would represent appeasementof the aggressor.Seeking ways out of the present situation and tounblock the process of conflict resolution  Azerbaijan demonstrating a constructive approach  has proposed toArmenia that it withdraw its occupation forces from thefour occupied districts and that it subsequently restorethe main-line railway interlinking Azerbaijan  Armeniaand other countries of the region. Conceived as agesture of goodwill  this unique package of measuresfor the partial elimination of the consequences of theconflict and for the revitalization of cooperation wouldsignificantly improve the negotiating environment andpublic opinion in both countries. This proposal ofAzerbaijan  promising benefits for both parties to theconflict and other countries of the region  enjoyed thewidest support of the OSCE and its Minsk Group  theEuropean Union and the Council of Europe. However when it came to taking practical measures  Armenia diligently demonstrating its commitment to peace andcooperation  rejected this step towards confidence.The situation of “no peace  no war” in theArmenian-Azerbaijani conflict is a time bomb and acause of despair for the people  first and foremostrefugees and internally displaced persons  who havebeen violently deprived of their homes  left to bear themost heavy burden of the consequences of theaggression and are now losing patience and hope forthe restoration of their legal rights. As a result ofArmenia's aggressive actions  Azerbaijan currentlygives shelter to more than 1 million refugees andinternally displaced persons. In years past  great workhas been carried out to solve the refugees' problems with the assistance of international humanitarianorganizations  the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) above all.At present  we feel that the urgent necessities fortargeted assistance are to provide medical institutionswith the necessary medical preparations andequipment  to implement agricultural programmes  tocreate jobs and to develop small-scaleentrepreneurship. We call upon UNHCR  otherinternational institutions and donor States to respond toour problems and to mobilize resources for facilitatingtheir solution on the required scale.Let me briefly touch upon the issue of UnitedNations reform aimed at increasing the effectivenessand practical results of the Organization's activities.We have to determine a number of possible reforms among which the expansion of the Security Councildeserves particular mention. I would like to express thehope that the broadest possible consensus on everyaspect of this issue will be reached. Greater balancewithin the Council could have been provided with theinclusion in its composition of influential developingcountries along with the developed ones. An increasein representation within one of the United Nationsleading bodies — within rational limits — would havereflected the realities of the time and the considerationof broader interests in the solution of crucial issuesrelated to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity. With regard to the reform  we would wishmore democracy  action and compatibility with thechallenges of change.I would like to believe that the reforms willenable the United Nations to confirm its role as auniversal Organization capable of maintaininginternational peace and security  preventing andresolving regional conflicts  and confronting globalthreats and risks under the new conditions ofglobalization.29"
"12",456,"BDI",57,2002,"﻿It is anhonour for me to address the General Assembly at itsfifty-seventh session. Let me first of all  Sir  dischargea pleasant duty on behalf of my delegation and on myown account  and extend to you my warmestcongratulations on your election to the presidency ofthe Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. You may restassured of the support and cooperation of thedelegation of Burundi towards the success of yourdifficult and important mission. I also pay tribute toyour predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo for the able manner in which he led the work of thefifty-sixth session.Furthermore  I would like to take this opportunityto express our gratitude to the United Nations  and topay tribute to its Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan for his support to the people of Burundi.Nor can I fail to thank the Security Council for itstireless efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis inBurundi. Through its two visits to Burundi  the lateston 5 and 6 May 2002  the Security Council has shownits solidarity with the people of Burundi in its quest forpeace.During my address  I shall inform the Assemblyof the political situation in Burundi  and of how far wehave come in the peace process; I will then go on tospeak of the challenges we still face and will concludemy statement with some comments on internationalissues.Following the establishment of transitionalinstitutions beginning 1 November 2001  the politicalclimate in Burundi has greatly improved. The politicalforces that had taken part in the Arusha negotiationsand signed the Peace Agreement now form theinstitutions of the Republic: the Government  theNational Assembly and the transitional Senate.Advocating dialogue in an armed conflict is notalways an easy task  but a sense of responsibility givesus no alternative. We are pleased to recall from thisrostrum that we have chosen the option of peacethrough dialogue and the procrastinations of othersinvolved in no way shake our conviction.Since we are on the right path  we request theSecretary-General  the Security Council  the AfricanUnion and the countries of our subregion to maintaintheir support for our quest for peace by assisting themediation activities  led by Nelson Mandela  assistedby Presidents El Hadj Omar Bongo and BenjaminMkapa and Vice-President Jacob Zuma  in order topersuade the protagonists to sign a ceasefire agreementwithout further delay. Indeed  certain provisions of theArusha Agreement are not being applied preciselybecause of the ongoing violence. That is why thenegotiation and signing of a ceasefire is a crucial stagein hastening and ensuring the success of the manyreforms to be undertaken.The task ahead is enormous  but it can beaccomplished. The smooth functioning of institutions isa guarantee of success  while daily experiencedemonstrates the serious commitment of the politicalpartners and is the basis of our optimism.While it is true that there are reasons for hope  itis equally true that the challenges to the peace processare genuine and could compromise our path to peace ifthey are not satisfactorily met in the short term. Theviolence which the rebels continue to force on theBurundian people is a major challenge not only to us but to the United Nations  whose primary mission is tomaintain peace throughout the world.We take this solemn opportunity to reiterate ourrequest to the entire international community to compelthe Burundian rebels to renounce violence. Ifdiplomacy does not succeed  all other means must beused in order to prevent this rebellion from takinghostage a peace process being led today by aGovernment formed on the basis of negotiations andwhich now enjoys international legitimacy. Peace willcome to the Great Lakes region when every countrythere is living in peace. To that end  the effort must beboth individual and collective. That is why my countryis prepared to continue making its contribution tocreating a better climate with all neighbouringcountries.The second major challenge is the reconstructioneffort. After nine years of crisis  the Burundianeconomy has been sorely tried. The population hasbecome further impoverished  all economic parametershave been destabilized  and our external indebtednessprevents us from resorting  as we have done in the past to the international financial marketplace. Here again 7we ask our traditional partners to give substantialsupport to our peace efforts. Promises have been madethat we hope will be kept in the near future. Indeed  therepatriation of refugees  the resettlement of displacedpersons and the rebuilding of damaged infrastructurewill require substantial financial resources.As members of the human community Burundians are also following the concerns of theworld  which  sadly  are many and to which we areconstantly seeking solutions. To cite but a few  Burundiwelcomes the creation of the Global Fund to FightAIDS and  like other countries that have been deeplyaffected by the pandemic  has requested that access toaffordable medicine be improved until such time asresearchers are able to develop a vaccine against thisscourge  which threatens all humankind  especially inAfrica. In the same vein  my delegation supports theidea of creating a world fund to fight poverty and alsowelcomes the proposal to establish a world fund for theenvironment.Even closer to home  our peoples await theconcrete results of the recent World Summit onSustainable Development in Johannesburg  at whichthe community of nations reaffirmed the need to worktogether towards equitable and viable development forcurrent and future generations. We also welcome theestablishment of the Office of the High Representativefor the Least Developed Countries  LandlockedDeveloping Countries and Small Island DevelopingStates. This testifies to the unequivocal commitment ofthe United Nations to enhancing and focusing effortson behalf of the most vulnerable groups of countries.On the African continent  the New Partnership forAfrica's Development is a major source of hope and  assuch  deserves the support of the international financialinstitutions and of the community of donors.Along with the poverty that is affecting millionsof human beings  another fearful danger is that ofterrorism. A year after the terrorist attacks of 11September 2001 in New York  Washington  D.C.  andPennsylvania  the world remains in a state of shock andis seeking ways to stem the scourge of internationalterrorism. To that end  Burundi is committed toimplementing the provisions of Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001)  which provides the blueprintfor a collective fight against terrorism.The great challenges of poverty  environmentaldegradation  international terrorism  armed conflict andincurable disease require all nations  rich and poor  torecognize international solidarity as the necessarymeans of survival for us all. The United Nations istherefore called on to meet this challenge  especially bycarrying out the necessary reform of its organs  theSecurity Council  the General Assembly and theEconomic and Social Council  in order to make themmore complementary and effective in the interest of all."
"13",503,"BEL",57,2002,"﻿Some50 years ago my predecessor Paul-Henri Spaak saidbefore the Assembly  in a phrase that stands out in ourminds  “We are afraid”. At that time  totalitarianismthreatened democratic freedoms and our open societywas in danger. Fortunately  political and diplomaticdialogue gradually won out over confrontation  mutualthreats and force. The advent of a freer world  moreunited and more respectful of everyone is finally withinour grasp. After September 2001  all democratic forcesthroughout the world felt a moment of fear  terror confusion and horror at the barbaric violence thatsmashed their strongest beliefs into pieces. Thatirrational hatred threatened the same democraticvalues  fundamental freedoms and humanistic worldoutlook.The free world came together with a sense ofsolidarity  compassion and survival. A coalition againstthat vile crime stood side by side with the people of theUnited States. We felt it was our duty; we felt that theirsuffering was our suffering and that their cause wasalso our cause. We could not permit there to be anydoubt in the minds of the enemies of our shared values;we could not leave any scope for those who sought tobreak the promise of a world of justice  progress andpeace.Today we must move beyond fear. Our responsemust be guided by clear-minded analysis and rationalaction. The enemy is faceless but is not everywhere.We all are now constantly vigilant  but must not reachthe point of being unable to look one another in the eyewithout mistrust or suspicion. We are in an infinitelygreat majority; only an infinitesimal minority is againstus. We cannot simply reduce the entire world to abattlefield. We cannot simply make a division betweengood and evil. To build a wall would be to fall into thetrap of those who openly display their hate andintolerance. Instead  more than ever we must realizethat the source of wealth and hope in the world isprecisely its great diversity and pluralism.The struggle against terrorism must  of course  bebased on effective methods with no room for laxity. Iwant to make this point very strongly: fightingterrorism must not lead us to distort the nature ofdemocratic tolerant life or respect for the rule of law.Preserving our concept of a pluralist  open and tolerantsociety must be our goal. We cannot be misled oraccept distortions of our firm belief in the fundamentalhuman rights and the rights of peoples. Combatingterrorism also means  above all  that we must defendthe fundamental rights and legal protections of everyman and woman. We have a humanist conviction andwe must defend it  because otherwise we would beceding victory to the terrorists. It would also be a2mistake to believe that the fight against terrorism canbe won by military means alone. Military means areadmittedly necessary  but are not themselves enough toput an end to this horrible phenomenon.There is absolutely nothing that can justifyterrorism. No cause can justify terror. I categoricallyand definitively reject the idea that we have to look tothe inequities of the world for the source of thisperversion of the mind and soul. In my view  thatwould mitigate this abominable act. The origin of theattack cannot be found there. However  we also knowthat misery  injustice  poverty  exclusion andhumiliation create fertile ground for extremism intolerance and hatred to flourish by taking advantageof the hopelessness and suffering of those left behindby a society too quickly satisfied by its clearconscience.Why should we deny it? As our Prime MinisterGuy Verhofstadt has said  in less than a year we havefocused at least four times on the challenges facing theworld: at Doha  Monterrey  Rome and Johannesburg.The elimination of poverty  debt reduction andliberalization of international trade as a factor fordevelopment are all questions that have beenrepeatedly discussed. We all come to the sameconclusions. We identify the same causes. I am certainthat we all know the solutions that must be applied.With such unanimity  it should be easy to put anend to inequality. It should be easy to bring together aworld which for too long has been cut in two  a worldthat generates tensions and frustrations. There cannotand should not be a superficial division at the marginof our wealth. We need a loftier conception ofcooperation  one that derives not from paternalism butrather from partnership and mutual respect.Putting an end to inequality and forging a newsolidarity is the way to ensure sustainable developmentfor future generations. At each of our summits  the richworld has raised the hopes of the millions of indigentpeople who are searching for a glimmer of light in thedarkness. However  each time  at the end of these grandmeetings  when the speeches are over  when those whoadvocate on behalf of the poor have stopped theirritualistic pleadings  poverty remains in place. One getsthe impression that we have offered those whoexpected so much of us only empty rhetoric andposturing.The Millennium Goals must become a benchmarkfor all the work of the United Nations and for that ofeach of its Member States. We have to translate theminto financial tools and into access to markets andtechnology. At Monterrey  my country pledged to reachthe target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product fordevelopment cooperation by 2010. We have offered furthermore  new initiatives on the debt burden.I also attach paramount importance to follow-upof the Durban Conference against racism  and to theimplementation of the Durban Programme of Action.Combating racism  discrimination and intolerance isabsolutely essential for the millions of human beingswho have often silently suffered from infringements ontheir dignity. I stress the historic importance of theagreement on the origins and causes of racism. It formsthe basis of a new partnership. Unless we recognizepast injustices  we will not have a solid basis for futureefforts.Another challenge that we wish to address is toattain absolute gender equality. This is absolutelyessential in a civilization of progress  in which ourideals of democracy and humanism are realized. TheSecretary-General and his team  including his Deputy Louise Fréchette  can count on my country'scommitment and support for all the reforms under way.We must revitalize the General Assembly  continue thestrengthening of the Economic and Social Council expand the Security Council and carry outorganizational reforms. I know that the United Nationswill take up these challenges.The outstanding and far-sighted speech made bySecretary-General Kofi Annan rightly  skilfully andresolutely reminded us what  in the final analysis  is themeaning of the world government and parliament. Hemade his statement very convincingly and intelligently.We share his view on reshaping our Organization sothat it can live up to our ambitions.My country was at the forefront of combatingimpunity for the most serious crimes and for the rapiddevelopment of a true international criminal justice.That is why we continue to support theinternationalization of the Rome Statute  and why weare resolved to preserve its integrity. Admittedly  weknow that the dialogue is never easy when law interactswith politics  but we are convinced that in the long-term  nothing will block society's right to demandjustice when the most serious crimes against3fundamental values are committed. States have primaryresponsibility for prosecuting the crimes covered in theStatute of the Court. We urge the world community including the most powerful among us  to give theCourt credibility and resources commensurate with itslofty mission.Conflict prevention is one of my country'sforeign policy priorities. We are engaged concretely inpreventive diplomacy  particularly in Central Africa where Belgium is proactively supportive of the Lusakaand Arusha peace processes. Belgium activelyadvocates this approach within the European Union.Belgium is seeking to make this concept of conflictprevention  conflict management and post-conflictsupport an essential part of international doctrine. Weneed standing monitoring and warning mechanisms toalert us in time to crises. Such mechanisms could sparethe lives of many people. For similar reasons  we needto develop a real strategy against the illegal financingof conflicts and the related illegal trade in naturalresources. The sordid exploitation of such resources —for instance  conflict diamonds — too often contributesto finance or at least prolong regional tragedies such ascivil wars and inter-ethnic conflicts.To face this challenge  a credible internationalmonitoring system  based on common standards  has tobe established. Substantial improvements must bemade in the functioning of the various sanctionscommittees  and we believe that a single monitoringbody  with a long-term mandate  should be set up.Africa is at the centre of our concerns  but also ofour hopes. The creation of the African Union duringthe Durban summit of the Organization of AfricanUnity  along with the dynamic of the New Partnershipfor Africa's Development (NEPAD)  are major stepsforward taken in recent months. The strengthening ofdemocracy and the recent successful elections in Africaare an encouraging sign. The prospects for Africa alsoinclude regional integration of African countries which we encourage. We can see some positive but stillfragile signs with regard to reconciliation in countriesthat have been too long devastated by conflicts  such asthe Great Lakes region  Angola and the Sudan.Further efforts have been made this year to find asolution to the conflict in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo. The inter-Congolese dialogue has led  first to the signing of a partial agreement at Sun City  whichcreated a dynamic of reconciliation  thanks to theefforts of South Africa  to which I pay tribute here. ThePretoria Agreement addresses the main causes of theconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: itsterritorial integrity and the security concerns ofRwanda. The United Nations Organization Mission inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has a crucialpart to play in ensuring implementation of theAgreement  with its operation to disarm and demobilizethe armed groups.I urge Rwanda and the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo to take advantage of this opportunity torestore to their peoples the peace and prosperity theydeserve. I would also like to pay tribute to the SpecialEnvoy of the Secretary-General  Mr. Niasse  forbringing all the Congolese parties to the negotiatingtable with a view to arriving at a democratic  inclusiveagreement.Through the many meetings I have attended in theregion  I have become acquainted with Congolesepolitical figures. I know that they have the will  theauthority  the competence and the grasp of history torealize the dream of peace and prosperity of apopulation which has suffered for too long.I should like also to pay tribute to the SouthAfrican and Tanzanian mediation in the context ofnegotiations for a ceasefire in Burundi. Despite theprogress made  there has been a resumption of violencethat could undermine the gains recorded in the Arushaprocess — so ably facilitated by the political and moralauthority of President Nelson Mandela. I would alsourgently appeal to all international partners to considerwhich concrete steps should be taken to help Burundiemerge from its political  economic and social crisis.The difficulties prevailing in this area are without adoubt complicating the political solution.Another area in need of structural stability is theMiddle East. Men  women  mothers  fathers  childrenall are suffering on a daily basis from the violence  andfor this reason we must reaffirm those principles thatwill enable us to find a lasting and equitable solution:land for peace  a viable Palestinian State and securityfor Israel. Rather than going beyond the gains madethrough Oslo and Madrid  we should enshrine andreconfirm them by translating them into reality. This iswhat the European Union has sought to do by drawingup a road map setting out the actions to be taken by theparties concerned with a view to achieving acomprehensive and lasting solution.4Lastly  let me ask a question that I think is ofglobal significance. The question of Iraq is a challengeto all of us  because it involves questions at severaldifferent levels: the need to eliminate a major threat tothe international community; the need to ensure thecredibility of our Organization; the need to determinewhether a country has weapons of mass destruction thatcan bring death to millions of people; the need todetermine if a country is failing to meet its obligationsto the United Nations; and the need to know if apreventive unilateral military action is or is not adoctrinal problem under international law.All of these questions are core issues with respectto our Organization  its missions and its individual andcollective political responsibilities.I wish to recall that each and every one of us  insigning the Charter of the United Nations  solemnlyundertook to comply with that Charter. Therefore  onbehalf of my country and of its citizens  I wish to makea clear appeal to Iraq. I formally and solemnly ask theIraqi authorities to implement urgently andunconditionally the resolutions adopted by the UnitedNations. Respect for our Organization and respect forwhat we are  collectively and individually  is the onlyway of avoiding recourse to force. I ask the Iraqiauthorities to seize this last opportunity.All of these challenges require a united multilateral reaction in a spirit of solidarity. The worldis a village now  but too often we are rather narrow-minded and do not listen to one another. Sometimes theother is seen as a stranger or even an intruder. Humancivilizations must learn more about one another inorder to live together in harmony.The citizens of the world have differentperspectives on life  on religion  on the way theyorganize their society  on the past and the future. Butthey all dream of justice  happiness and equality. Oftenthey dream the same dream  but the path toimplementing that dream sometimes varies. Respectingothers even though they are different will help us movetowards a more harmonious world. This is what we  aspolitical leaders  have a responsibility to do  in order tobroaden day after day the common area of the valuesthat we share."
"14",548,"BEN",57,2002,"﻿On behalf ofthe delegation of the Republic of Benin  allow me toconvey to Mr. Jan Kavan our heartfelt congratulationson his well-deserved election to the presidency of thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Hisskills  his extensive experience in international affairsand his dedication to the lofty causes championed bythe United Nations guarantee the success of our work.I wish to assure him of my delegation's fullcooperation and support in ensuring the full success ofthe work of this session.I should like to take this opportunity also tocongratulate and to thank his predecessor  Mr. HanSeung-soo of the Republic of Korea  who presided soably and with such dedication over the work of thefifty-sixth session of the Assembly.I wish also to pay tribute to our Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  whose devotion and skills haveenhanced the prestige of our Organization.The message that I bring the Assembly fromBenin is a message of peace  which our people areexperiencing  and a message of the preservation ofpeace in all its aspects  in keeping with the Charter ofour Organization and with the Millennium Declaration in which we pledged to build for future generations aworld free from fear  hunger and ignorance.24The barbaric acts perpetrated a year ago  on 11September 2001 here in New York and in other places are still vivid in our memory  making ever more urgentthe need to make greater strides in our commonendeavour of civilization. The sincere and spontaneouscompassion and sympathy of the peoples of the worldfor the victims of the terrible attacks of 11 Septemberprove that more than ever before we are bound by acommon destiny.It is therefore vital to give real meaning to thissolidarity and this shared responsibility. The UnitedNations must continue to play a dynamic role in thepromotion of international cooperation in order toprevent and punish acts of terrorism.For Benin  nothing — no pretext whatsoever —could justify such barbaric acts  and the terrifyingimages that I am loath to recall today will remainetched in our collective memory throughout thetwenty-first century. Benin's firm commitment tocombating terrorism is unambiguous  and we intend tofight this scourge with resolve.Thus  pursuant to Security Council resolution1373 (2001)  adopted on 28 September 2001  Beninsubmitted a report on the measures we have taken toprevent and punish acts of terrorism. A constructiveand effective dialogue is under way with the SecurityCouncil Committee regarding proposed measures toprevent and suppress the financing of acts of terrorism.However  the anti-terrorist campaign will be moreeffective and more comprehensive if it is organized onthe basis of strict respect for the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations. We believe that thereis an urgent need for a clear  precise  legal definition ofinternational terrorism in order to prevent thehaphazard character of our individual or collectiveinitiatives from jeopardizing the effectiveness of theglobal coalition against the terrorist threat.By placing Africa at the centre of its concerns forthe new millennium  the United Nations has rightlyfocused the attention of the international community onthat continent  which  despite its commendable efforts is having difficulty finding its way towardsdevelopment. The persistence of war and conflict which repeatedly lead to great bloodshed in that part ofthe world  is one of the main reasons for that situation.Aware that  as it faces new challenges  ourcontinent is at a critical stage in its development andthat it is for Africa to shoulder its own responsibilities African leaders have taken a number of politicalinitiatives aimed at resolving conflict  rising to thegreat challenge of endowing Africa with new forumsfor dialogue and action. This African renaissance  bymeans of which Africa is determined to take control ofits own destiny and find solutions to its ills  should beencouraged through support for the African Union which was launched in Durban  South Africa  in Julythis year. The African Union espouses the vision of thefounding fathers of the African nations and of theformer Organization of African Unity. The AfricanUnion is different from the Organization of AfricanUnity because it stresses the need for the economicintegration of the continent and affirms that peace security and stability are indispensable conditions forthe creation of an environment conducive todevelopment and that good governance must be thenorm for our States.I wish to reaffirm what many earlier speakershave said: Africa is beginning to play its proper role. Itlooks forward to a concrete demonstration of thegoodwill so often expressed by the internationalcommunity. It looks forward to real action in the formof deeds. We expect this for the New Partnership forAfrica's Development (NEPAD)  for example.Under the wise guidance of the President of theGeneral Assembly  we spent an entire day debating thatAfrican Union programme. Relevant remarks wereuttered  commitments undertaken and forcefulstatements made from this very rostrum  and I do notneed to dwell further on that subject. Now is the timefor action  and time is of the essence.Globalization must become synonymous with abetter life for all the peoples of the world. The worldcannot just stand by and watch the spectacle of anAfrica that has been marginalized and ravaged by warsand disease. Africa must not be an object ofcondescension  as if the world did not have sufficientresources to avert catastrophe. I am sure that ourcollective awareness is real and sincere.That is why I welcome the timely initiative of theSecurity Council to establish an Ad Hoc WorkingGroup on Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa.We hope that that initiative will demonstrate a genuine ongoing commitment on the part of the SecurityCouncil to act to put an end to the cycle of violence inAfrica  thereby according equal treatment to allhumanitarian crises without exception.25In the context of collective efforts to consider anddeal with the question of conflict prevention andresolution through a comprehensive  integratedapproach that takes into account political  economicand social dimensions  my delegation recommendsreinforced interaction between the Security Counciland the Economic and Social Council  in particular bydeveloping close consultations with the Ad HocAdvisory Group of the Economic and Social Councilon African countries emerging from conflict.One of the most encouraging signs for Africa inrecent years — indeed in recent months — is the firmdetermination finally to put an end to fratricidalwarfare. We must support such efforts everywhere including in Sierra Leone  Angola  Congo  Eritrea andEthiopia.I want to comment in particular on Sierra Leone which has successfully emerged from a risky anddangerous electoral process. I would like to take thisopportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the UnitedNations and to the countries which  at the bilaterallevel  have been helping Sierra Leone to reintegrateitself into the community of nations. I hope that thepositive evolution of the situation in that country willhave a ripple effect within the Mano River Union.I welcome the outstanding progress that has beenmade in the process towards the restoration of peaceand security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.In that respect  I would like to pay a well-deservedtribute to President Thabo Mbeki and to the facilitator Sir Ketumile Masire  for their commitment andperseverance.We welcome the fact that the guns have now beensilenced in Angola after so many years of suffering destruction and privation. It is crucial to strengthen andconsolidate the peace process that is under way in thatcountry. That is why I urgently appeal to theinternational community to provide support that iscommensurate with the enormous reconstruction needsof Angola. Only thus will conditions be right for theestablishment of lasting peace and sustainabledevelopment.I am pleased to note  among the initiatives topromote peace in Africa  the success of negotiations onan agreement on the demarcation of the border betweenEthiopia and Eritrea and the continuing dialogue torestore peace in Burundi and the Sudan.In January this year  49 of the poorest countriesof the world chose my country  Benin  to hold thechairmanship of the coordinating office for the leastdeveloped countries. When we accepted thatprestigious post  my Government was well aware of theheavy responsibilities that we were assuming.The most important item on mankind's agendatoday is sustainable development. Any progress — orany regression — must be assessed by the group ofcountries that Benin is now coordinating. Theinternational community itself recognizes that manyproblems remain. The Third United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries notedwith regret that previous goals had not been achieved and it clearly identified the main obstacles to thedevelopment of the least developed countries. Theseinclude the continuing decrease in official developmentassistance  the debt burden  the difficulty of gainingaccess to the markets of the developed countries andthe lack of foreign investment. By adopting aProgramme of Action and a Political Declaration atBrussels  the international community renewed itscommitment to helping the least developed countriesresolutely to deal with mechanisms whose operationsincrease poverty.Mindful of the need to mobilize energy andincrease capacity in order thoroughly to implement theBrussels Programme of Action  the least developedcountries took the initiative of meeting at Cotonou from 5 to 7 August 2002  in order to consider ways andmeans of ensuring the implementation of theProgramme.The Cotonou conference formulated guidelinesand made recommendations  contained in the importantCotonou Declaration. At the national level  theDeclaration recommends the establishment of animplementation and follow-up mechanism to monitorintegration of the Programme of Action into nationaldevelopment programmes and to promote the creationof a national forum for dialogue. It also recommendsthat the least developed countries design their strategicdevelopment priorities in keeping with local contexts.That is an important factor for guaranteeing rationalityand national ownership of policies. At the internationallevel  United Nations and other international agenciesare called on to incorporate the Programme of Actioninto their work programmes and Governmentprocesses.26I believe it important to call attention to thedangerous dwindling of resources available to theoperational institutions of the United Nationssystem — particularly the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme  the United Nations Population Fund  theUnited Nations Capital Development Fund  the UnitedNations Children's Fund and the World HealthOrganization — and to stress the crucial need to findways and means of increasing those resources in orderto strengthen these agencies' valuable efforts to combatpoverty in our countries.The Cotonou ministerial meeting alsorecommended the establishment of a synoptic table tobe used by the Economic and Social Council when itreviews and follows up the implementation of theProgramme of Action by the least developed countriesand their development partners.I wish at this point to reiterate our gratificationand thanks to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for thecelerity with which he implemented the decision takenby the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session toestablish the Office of the High Representative for theLeast Developed Countries  Landlocked DevelopingCountries and Small Island Developing States. TheSecretary-General nominated Ambassador Chowdhuryof Bangladesh to that important post  which he hasalready assumed. In nominating AmbassadorChowdhury  the Secretary-General could not havemade a more fortunate choice. We all knowAmbassador Chowdhury and his great experience resolve and dedication. His country  Bangladesh  hasserved the group of least developed countries withdistinction for 20 years. I salute that work today. TheSecretary-General and each one of us must now offerevery assistance to Ambassador Chowdhury and hisOffice in becoming fully operational and in carryingout his important mission of obtaining the resourcesnecessary for action.To that end  it is important that every Member ofthe United Nations  even the poorest  make someeffort  for example  by contributing to the Trust Fundto support the implementation of the BrusselsProgramme of Action. The Government of Benin willassume all its responsibilities in that respect in duecourse.In Johannesburg recently  at the World Summit onSustainable Development  the international communityacknowledged its responsibility to the poor  thevulnerable and the marginalized as members of thegreat human family. It also recognized the need toconclude a world alliance for sustainable development by which the developed countries would make theessential effort of solidarity with the poorest. A giantstep forward was taken there  but action is nowrequired. We fervently hope today that all the measuresadvocated in Johannesburg will become a reality. Ifthey do not  there will be no reduction  but an increasein poverty. We can stave off that danger  which isdeadly for all of us."
"15",594,"BFA",57,2002,"﻿As is the case every year  Burkina Faso isvery pleased to take part in the regular session of theGeneral Assembly  this great meeting of peoples unitedby the same destiny and motivated by the same ideal:to build a world of justice  love and peace. I amconvinced  Mr. President  that the choice of a person ofyour great ability to preside over this fifty-seventhsession will help us greatly. As we congratulate youand the members of the Bureau on that special honour my delegation and I want to assure you of our fullavailability and cooperation for the success of yourmission. We also want to express again our profoundrecognition of your predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo for the competence with which he presided over thefifty-sixth session.The quest for peace and security and thepromotion of cooperation and development are theessential values that presided over the creation of theUnited Nations. Today  more than ever before  with thetragic events of 11 September 2001 — whose firstanniversary we have just commemorated — thoseobjectives have assumed a more immediate and urgentcharacter  because world peace finds itself seriouslythreatened  in particular by international terrorism. Wemust all convince ourselves that the best response tointernational terrorism must proceed from collectiveaction — in other words  from action by the entireinternational community.As a member of that community  Burkina Faso —which has made the quest for peace a creed —reaffirms most solemnly  vigorously andunambiguously its condemnation of terrorism in all itsforms  whatever the motivations. Our determination tofight alongside the United Nations against that dangeris unwavering  and our implementation of SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) was the subject of areport submitted to the Committee established pursuantto that resolution.If the fight against terrorism henceforth occupiesthe spotlight  that must not obscure the imperativenecessity of finding just and lasting solutions tointernational crises  particularly regional conflicts thatso often feed and maintain that scourge. In this15connection  Burkina Faso welcomes the laudableinitiatives of the United Nations to restore peace tomany regions of the world  particularly Africa  whereUnited Nations interventions — coupled with theinitiatives of the Organization of African Unity  whichhas become the African Union  and those of theAfrican subregional organizations — have made itpossible to pacify many areas of tension and conflictthat were ravaging parts of our continent.We also welcome the gradual return to peace inSierra Leone  in Angola  in the Great Lakes region between Ethiopia and Eritrea and in Sudan  even if inthe latter case we must regret the suspension of theagreement between the Government of that country andthe armed rebellion.In Western Africa  the hopes that arose at the endof the war in Sierra Leone unfortunately seemunfulfilled with the resumption of combat inneighbouring Liberia.We cannot remain passive in the face of civil warin that sister country. Supported by others of goodwilland working within the framework of the process of theEconomic Community of West African States  BurkinaFaso convened a meeting in Ouagadougou from 8 to 11July between a number of Liberian political parties civil society organizations  associations andmovements with a view to renewing the inter-Liberiandialogue. By agreeing to host that important meeting my country  Burkina Faso  hoped to provide a furtherchance for dialogue  which the Liberians themselvesdesired. The initiative was supportive of efforts thathad already been agreed upon in the context of theRabat process and the Mano River Union.This year has been particularly bloody in theMiddle East. We cannot forget the excesses committedin Jenin and the harassment of President Arafat atRamallah. The atrocities perpetrated every day againstthe unarmed Palestinian civilian population are a greatcause for concern. Dialogue and negotiation mustprevail over confrontation and violence. Burkina Fasoreaffirms its support for the creation of an independentPalestinian State  existing side by side with Israel  andwe strongly urge the Security Council to ensure that itsrelevant resolutions are implemented.With regard to Iraq  Burkina Faso welcomes thefact that reason has prevailed. We remain convincedthat unilateral preventive action that is not authorizedby the Security Council would have dire consequencesfor world peace. In that connection  we would like topay tribute to the courageous decision of the IraqiGovernment  which has just agreed to the return toBaghdad of United Nations weapons inspectors. Weearnestly hope that that approach will ultimately lead toa definitive resolution of the crisis  especially since thesanctions imposed on that country are unjust and havemade martyrs of the Iraqi people.Burkina Faso has always made it clear that  apartfrom their unjust character  sanctions cannot properlyresolve substantive problems but arecounterproductive. We therefore request the lifting ofall sanctions against Iraq  Cuba and Iran  as well asthose imposed on Libya in connection with theLockerbie question.With regard to that latter question  Burkina Fasobelieves that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has fullydischarged its obligations to the Security Council andthat the sanctions imposed on it should now be lifted.As a result of the demands of globalization protecting the right to development has become themost important obligation for our countries. Wetherefore place great hope in the New Partnership forAfrica's Development (NEPAD)  to which theAssembly has just devoted a special debate. We shouldrecall that that new initiative shows how determinedAfrican leaders are to work tirelessly to rid thecontinent of poverty and marginalization.During a recent forum that took place inOuagadougou on the role of the private sector in theimplementation of NEPAD  President Blaise Compaorestressed two major responsibilities that are incumbentupon the international community. The first relates tothe enhancement and structural reform of officialdevelopment assistance so as to adapt it to the needs ofits beneficiaries and to improve its effect on theirstandard of living. The second relates to the problem ofthe access of African goods to the markets of theindustrialized countries and the need to put an end toanti-competitive subsidies that run counter to the rulesof the World Trade Organization.More generally  the various meetings ondevelopment that have taken place this year  inparticular the International Conference on Financingfor Development  held at Monterrey  and the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  held atJohannesburg  as well as the commitments set out in16the Millennium Declaration  open up new andencouraging prospects for developing countries.It remains true  however  that the best form ofdevelopment is that which takes into account therequirements of democracy and human rights. In thisconnection  I would like to assure the Assembly thatmy country will be resolute in ensuring that democracybecomes rooted in our political and institutional life and we are taking significant and concrete actions tothat end. The people of Burkina Faso have thus justrenewed  for a third consecutive time and for a furtherfive years  the mandate of the National Assembly. Thatelection  in which all the political parties took part took place in a calm  transparent and fair manner andhas seated members of 13 political parties to legislateon questions of interest to the people of Burkina Faso.The Government has also created a Ministry forthe Promotion of Human Rights to ensure respect forand the implementation of human rights in all theiraspects. That is why my Government welcomes theelection of Burkina Faso to the United NationsCommission on Human Rights  which will enable us tomake a positive and active contribution to the work andthe deliberations of that international body  whichmonitors the implementation of human rightsthroughout the world. Furthermore  our Government isdetermined to greatly enhance the status of women andchildren in line with the recommendations of thespecial session of the General Assembly on children.It is thus clear that the credibility andeffectiveness of the United Nations is increasing on adaily basis  whether with regard to the promotion ofpeace and security  to economic cooperation or toactivities in the social and humanitarian sphere.The recent admission of Switzerland to theUnited Nations and the forthcoming admission ofTimor-Leste further confirm the irreplaceable role ofthe United Nations as an means of ensuringinternational stability. It is precisely because of thatuniversality that Burkina Faso is able to call upon theinternational community to consider the return of theRepublic of China to this world Organization. Taiwanhas clearly shown that it is a free  independent democratic nation that enjoys all the attributes of aState under international law and that would thus beable to make a truly useful contribution to the buildingof a better future for humankind. The credibility of theUnited Nations is at stake in this respect.In conclusion  I should like  on behalf of mycountry  to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for hisassured leadership of this Organization  as well as tothe staff of the United Nations for their tirelesscontribution to the quest for peace."
"16",637,"BGD",57,2002,"﻿May I begin byextending my warm congratulations to the Presidentupon his election. We have every confidence that hisstewardship of our proceedings will yield fruitfulresults. Credit is due also to his predecessor  Mr. HanSeung-soo  for his deft handling of our affairs. We alsocongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan for theleadership he has shown during the past year across avery broad range of subjects. His inaugural remarks which have set the tone for our deliberations  are trulypraiseworthy. We welcome two new Members thisyear  Switzerland and  soon  East Timor. We lookforward to working closely with them.As we are all painfully aware  this has been avery difficult year. The day of 11 September 2001witnessed a dastardly act of barbaric terrorism. It alsounited peace-loving peoples all over the world as neverbefore. As we continue our struggle to prevent theresurgence of such atrocities  we must also addressourselves seriously to the task of rooting out the causesthat spawn such behaviour. Any action in that respectshould be based on the widest possible internationalconsensus-building through consultations.Bangladesh has been and shall always be acommitted and active partner in the coalition againstterrorism. We have taken every necessary step to shareinformation and assist in the curbing of terror. We havesought to implement Security Council resolution 1373(2001)  which we ourselves helped to draft and adoptlast year as a member of the Council. At the regionallevel  we are currently examining ways and means offurther strengthening the South Asian Association forRegional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Conventionon Suppression of Terrorism. Terror is totallyunconnected to any faith or region. It is a globalphenomenon that needs to be tackled by means that areboth legitimate and consensual.Those methods include the promotion ofdemocracy and democratic values  respect for humanrights and the rule of law  the peaceful resolution ofconflicts  peace-building  cooperation towardsequitable economic development  the eradication ofpoverty  gender equality  measures aimed atconfidence-building  mutual respect among races andpeoples  and harmony — not clashes — betweencultures. Those are the main pillars on which we mustbuild a world where hope will reign in place of despair.In the construction of this edifice  the architect must bethe United Nations — which  with its Charterprinciples and purposes — is the greatest institutioncrafted by humankind.Bangladesh is relentless in the pursuit of thosegoals  both nationally and internationally. Ourproblems  as all are aware  are many and varied. Ofroughly the size of the state of Wisconsin in the UnitedStates  we have a population of 130 million people which makes us one of the largest nations in the world.Centuries of colonial exploitation left us withinadequate infrastructure and resources  and5constrained us in the trap of poverty. Subject to thevagaries of nature  our economy was a gamble inmonsoons. Soon after our independence  in 1971  wewere perceived as an irredeemable basket case.Since then  we have come a long way. We havededicated ourselves wholeheartedly to improving thequality of life of our people and to their development.Our policies were grounded in certain values dear toour hearts. We have acted in the firm belief thatdevelopment is possible only against a matrix ofdemocracy  human rights and the rule of law; thatstructures and institutions in society must be inclusive participatory and accountable; and that growth must bepro-poor  pro-environment  pro-equity and pro-women.In our view  tolerance among religions and anappreciation of differing opinions must be imbedded inthe social psyche. Our rich intellectual heritage andcultural tradition have been the source of home-growninnovative ideas such as micro-credit and specialeducational projects that have enabled us to initiate thequiet revolution in our society that has led to a processof huge societal transformation.As a result  we have been able to achieve manysuccesses  which have been widely acclaimed. Despiteour being a traditional society  through effective familyplanning programmes we were able to cut thepopulation growth rate by 50 per cent over the last twodecades. In agriculture  we now produce sufficient foodgrains to feed our entire people. We have investedheavily in human resources development and haveprovided massive budgetary allocations for primaryand secondary education. Schooling up to twelfth gradeis free for girl students  and all are awarded stipends.Gender mainstreaming is a major policy thrust. InBangladesh the empowerment of women receives thehighest priority. This is achieved mainly throughinitiatives such as special provisions for education forgirl children  employment of women in the garmentindustry  and micro-credit schemes that generate self-employment for women. Global recognition of theseendeavours was manifest in our recent election to theCommittee on the Elimination of Discriminationagainst Women.Excellent cooperation exists between theGovernment and civil society. Bangladesh hosts someof the world's largest and most active non-governmental organizations. In our developmentprocess  we are ourselves in the driver's seat. A mix ofappropriate macro-economic policies and effectiveutilization of external assistance has vastly reduced ourdependence on foreign aid. A document at theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  held at Monterrey  entitled “Successfuldevelopment: models for the twenty-first century” saysthat“The lesson in Bangladesh is that officialdevelopment assistance  when applied inconjunction with a country's efforts to resolve itsown development challenges  can yield dramaticresults.”Today what we seek is not compassion  largesse orcharity  but greater market access for our manufacturedproducts  fairer trade and more investment. We maystill have a long way to go  but we believe we are onthe right track.At the international level  we are striving toreinforce mutually beneficial and cooperative relationswith all countries. We are seeking  in concert with ourdevelopment partners  to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. The special efforts made  and thesuccesses achieved  in Monterrey  Johannesburg and atthe special session on children have given us cause forhope. It is now important for all of us to seriously getdown to implementing the promises made and toachieving the targets set. We are happy that our imageabroad is one of a responsible  politically stable moderate  democratic and constructive member of theinternational community. We have actively engaged ourneighbours in the development of cooperation andunderstanding. As the Assembly will recall  it wasPresident Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh who firstconceived of the concept of the South AsianAssociation for Regional Cooperation. Today  ourPrime Minister  Begum Khaleda Zia  is also committedto bringing the Asian cooperation dialogue to fruition.As a demonstration of our commitment to globalstability and peace  we have voluntarily given up thenuclear option and joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We activelyparticipate in peacekeeping operations  and arecurrently one of the largest contributors ofpeacekeepers in the United Nations.I should note  however  that there are certainissues that continue to trouble us. In South Asia  ourown region  the volatility of the situation between twonuclear-capable countries is deeply worrisome.6Bangladesh encourages all concerned in South Asia toexercise utmost restraint and seek solutions to theirdifferences through dialogue and meaningfulengagement.After emerging from the most destructive episodein its history  Afghanistan has yet to be given thewherewithal for recovery and reconstruction. Theinternational community must redouble its efforts tosecure peace throughout Afghanistan and accelerate thereconstruction and rebuilding of the country. Unless wedo so  the long-term security and stability of our regionwill remain very uncertain.In the Middle East  the continued denial of theright of the Palestinian people to their own State and tofreedom greatly concern us. The continued illegaloccupation of Palestinian land  the trampling of humanrights and the atrocities perpetrated against thePalestinian people by Israel must end immediately.Serious efforts must be resumed to seek acomprehensive solution to the problem — a solutionthat addresses the legitimate concerns of thePalestinian people.We welcome the announcement made in Baghdadwith regard to the return of the weapons inspectors  andwe see this as a significant step towards the fulfilmentof obligations under Security Council resolutions.The havoc wrought in Africa by ethnic conflict disease and famine is very disturbing. The financialturmoil in Latin America is a matter of anxiety for allof us. Commitments to the least developed countriesremain largely unfulfilled. The existence of large trade-distorting subsidies that impede development ispainfully clear. Restrictions on the movement of factorsof production  including manpower  remain a majorimpediment to progress. Lack of consideration of theemotional and human aspects of people's movementacross frontiers remains a great source of pain. Theconcept of a global fund for poverty alleviationfinanced through some form of international taxation isalso worth considering. These are issues that we  withour limited capacity  can do little to influence —though in our modest way we will do our very best tohelp. Those who can must do more.For our part  we will play an effective role — aswe are indeed doing — in all international forums. Inthe World Trade Organization we will continue to workwith others to implement the development objectives ofthe Doha Round and to pursue fairer trade. We willcooperate with the international monetary institutionsand other agencies  funds and programmes to promotethe welfare of our people and those of a comparablemilieu. Working within the United Nations  we shallendeavour in every possible way to strengthen itsinstitutions and to support reforms that will renderthem more participatory  representative anddemocratic. These are pledges that are enshrined in thevision for the future of the Government of the People'sRepublic of Bangladesh under the dynamic leadershipof Begum Khaleda Zia. They are commitments that areat the core of the Bangladeshi ethos."
"17",683,"BGR",57,2002,"﻿At the outset  let me congratulate you  Mr. President on your election to this responsible position. Your vastpolitical experience and diplomatic skills guarantee thesuccessful discharge of your duties  on behalf of theUnited Nations cause and for the prestige of thefriendly Czech Republic.The events of the past year do not allow us totreat this session merely as a routine one; they give amore specific nature. It should go beyond the routinepolitical declarations and should aim at achievingspecific results. This session should address theunfinished tasks of the Millennium Declaration and thenew challenges to international peace and security primarily the fight against terrorism. The sessionshould contribute to resolving the persistent problems17of underdevelopment  poverty and widespread diseasethroughout the world.Unfortunately  regional crises and conflicts indifferent parts of the world continue to dominate theGeneral Assembly agenda. Bulgaria has been closelyfollowing the situation in the Middle East  and itsupports efforts to find fair and lasting solutions. Weshare the view that progress can be achieved only onthe basis of dialogue and cooperation between theparties concerned and with the active engagement ofthe “quartet” in this process.The situation in Afghanistan is still volatile. TheGovernment needs comprehensive support to enhanceinternal stability and security and to rebuild thecountry. Therefore  Bulgaria has suggested that theexternal debt of Afghanistan be relieved in order tostimulate economic development of that country.Iraq has been of a focus of attention of the UnitedNations for the past 12 years. The full implementationof Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq is ofurgent importance. We expect Iraq to complyimmediately and unconditionally with thoseresolutions. For its part  the Council must take actionsthat will uphold its authority and credibility as thesingle international body responsible for themaintenance of world peace and security. I concur withthe views expressed thus far by Secretary-General KofiAnnan  President Bush and other previous speakersabout the need to act decisively and without delay toadopt an effective  workable Security Council positionon this issue.Bulgaria has come to the fifty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly with the added responsibility ofa member of the Security Council. We are stronglycommitted to the principles of consensus  constructivedialogue and transparency in the work of the Council.The fight against terrorism is a top internationalpriority today. Yesterday's special meeting of theSecurity Council reaffirmed the validity of resolution1373 (2001) and commended the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. The presidential statement supported unanimously by the Council  reflects thepolitical will for common action against terrorism in allits forms and manifestations. I would add that the fightagainst terrorism should not lead to persecution onreligious or ethnic grounds nor infringe upon humanrights.Bulgaria is already a party to all internationalconventions against terrorism. Moreover  my countryhas made a substantial contribution to all internationalefforts by sending its contingent to Afghanistan.Anti-terrorist efforts require a serious rethinkingof current approaches to cooperation. We are awarethat terrorism is often linked to other security threats such as organized crime  drug trafficking  corruption money-laundering and the illegal arms trade. Bulgariahas initiated and actively participated in a number ofbilateral and regional cooperation arrangements onthese issues. My country is increasingly effective inblocking one of the routes of drug trafficking towardsEurope. We have adopted one of the most stringentlaws on export controls over the arms trade and havebeen implementing a whole range of its provisionsdecisively.Developments in South-Eastern Europe remaindynamic and volatile. Yet  for the first time in recentyears it has been positive. I  for one  am optimistic thatthe legacy of conflict and confrontation could besurmounted at long last  and stability  peace andsecurity can finally be established in the region. Thisprocess should be continued and made irreversible. Allcountries in South-Eastern Europe today share thesame European perspective  and this is what gives megrounds for optimism. For Bulgaria  early membershipin the European Union and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) is a strategic priority enjoyingwide public support.During the years of crisis and post-crisismanagement in South-Eastern Europe  Bulgaria hasshown the capacity and proved its ability to generatestability and security in the region. It continues topromote the effective and strict implementation of theChemical Weapons and Biological WeaponsConventions. The uncontrolled proliferation of smallarms is another source of terrorism. Furthermore  westrongly support the United Nations Programme ofAction in this sphere.International human rights protection should takeplace in the spirit of justice and equality  in line withthe United Nations Charter and the principles ofinternational law. The United Nations should be in aposition to respond promptly and more effectively toany serious human rights violations. This is why wesupport the ongoing reforms in the monitoringmechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights.18Bulgaria believes that the internal security of anyState lies in the exercise of all human rights by personsbelonging to minorities within the State and is closelylinked to the internal stability of that State. Allindividuals should enjoy their rights on the basis ofnon-discrimination and equality before the law. In thisregard  we insist that the international community'sefforts should be focused primarily on theimplementation of existing standards.Decisions should be taken to make the UnitedNations more effective in fulfilling its numerousresponsibilities. Bulgaria supports the reform measuresinitiated by Secretary-General Kofi Annan. UnitedNations reform must continue and take into account infuture the new political and economic realities. Inparticular  it must address the specific issues ofsustainable development. I emphasize this point because I am still under the influence of theJohannesburg World Summit  where my country onceagain confirmed its strong support to efforts targeted atthe eradication of poverty and achieving sustainablepatterns of production and consumption  as well asproviding decent health care and education to theEarth's population.Mr. President  I would like to assure you thatBulgaria regard the work of the United Nations with agreat sense of responsibility. We stand ready toparticipate in the discussions and decision-making onall agenda items. The world today needs resolutenessand firmness in order to meet the new challenges tointernational peace  security and sustainabledevelopment. The United Nations offers the bestframework for tackling these challenges. Bulgaria iswilling and able to make its contribution to suchinternational efforts."
"18",728,"BHR",57,2002,"﻿I should like at the outsetto sincerely congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I should also like to express my deepappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea  for histireless efforts in conducting the proceedings of thefifty-sixth session  as well as of the twenty-seventhspecial session of the Assembly  on children.I should also like to express our deep appreciationto Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his continuedefforts to enhance the role of the United Nations and toenable it to achieve the noble and lofty objectives forwhich it was created.Furthermore  I am pleased to extend mycongratulations to the Swiss Confederation on itshaving joined the Organization. I would like also tocongratulate East Timor on attaining its independence.It is also my pleasure to welcome the establishment ofthe African Union  the successor to the Organization ofAfrican Unity.9This session was convened on the firstanniversary of 11 September  an event that terrified theinternational community  shocked the humanconscience and unified international efforts to face upto an enemy that has no religion  ethnicity  race ornationality. That enemy is terrorism.On this painful anniversary  it is incumbent uponus to again extend our condolences and sympathy tothe United States of America and its friendly people and to the families of the victims everywhere  and tocondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.We affirm our support for all international efforts thatseek to combat its elements and to uproot it.In line with the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter and with international efforts the Kingdom of Bahrain has sought  since attainingindependence  to build a modern State and a civilsociety in which the human being is the focal point.Such a human being would be prepared and qualifiedto cope with the political  economic and socialrequirements of modern life.Moreover  taking firm and confident steps  theKingdom of Bahrain affirms its commitment to thedevelopment and modernization process taking placeunder the leadership of His Majesty Shaikh Hamad BinIsa Al-Khalifa  King of the Kingdom of Bahrain. Mycountry was proclaimed a constitutional monarchyfollowing a plebiscite on our National Action Charter designed to promote democratic and constitutional lifein Bahrain. The municipal elections in May 2002  inwhich women participated both as voters and ascandidates  were a success; preparations are now underway for parliamentary elections  which are to takeplace in October.The Government and the people have made aconcerted effort to ensure success in the democraticand developmental process  as set out in the Kingdom'sConstitution and in its policies and programmes in allfields. In this regard  the Kingdom has acceded to theConvention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women. Civic activities havebeen enhanced and the number of non-governmentalorganizations has risen. These have been promoted sothat all the people of Bahrain may participate inexpanding national efforts to ensure the well-being ofthe people and respect for human rights in all civil political  economic  social and cultural areas.The Kingdom of Bahrain takes pride in theseachievements  which have been recognized by theUnited Nations Human Development Report for 2002 which ranked the Kingdom of Bahrain high among allcountries of the world and  for the sixth time  firstamong sisterly Arab States. Furthermore  the ArabHuman Development Report 2002 has also mentionedour achievements  showing once again the success ofthe Kingdom's democratic and development strategy inall areas.Moreover  the leadership and the people of theKingdom of Bahrain are proud that  in a report recentlypublished by the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization  Bahrain was ranked 42ndamong the 87 countries included in the report  and firstin the Arab world.The Kingdom of Bahrain attaches greatimportance to the question of regional security  becauseof the repercussions it has on the security and stabilityof States and peoples. Accordingly  Bahrain hasconsistently sought to consolidate neighbourlyrelations and mutual respect with its neighbouringStates. Bahrain looks forward to the peaceful resolutionof the question of the three Emirates islands  inaccordance with the principles and rules ofinternational law and in a brotherly spirit ofunderstanding  on the basis of recent positivedevelopments in the relations between the Statesmembers of the Gulf Cooperation Council and theIslamic Republic of Iran  and in the light of the directcontacts that have taken place recently  in particularthose between the United Arab Emirates and Iran.Furthermore  the Arab Summit  held in Beirut lastMarch  confirmed the necessity and importance ofsecurity and stability in the Gulf region and of creatinga propitious atmosphere for the restoration of normalrelations among the States of the region. It called uponIraq to complete the implementation of relevantSecurity Council resolutions on the situation betweenIraq and Kuwait  especially those relating to Kuwaitiand third-country prisoners of war; to cooperate withthe United Nations with a view to alleviating thesuffering of the people of Iraq; and to avoid anyconfrontation that might threaten the States andpeoples of the region or the unity and territorialintegrity of Iraq  and that might be used as a pretext forinterfering in Iraq's internal affairs.10The Middle East is currently facing great dangeras a result of Israel's policy in the occupied Palestinianterritories and of its perpetration of the most heinouscrimes against the Palestinian people  such asassassinations  blockades and the destruction of theinfrastructure and the economy. The events that tookplace in the Jenin refugee camp and in the Gaza Strip along with the daily events that occur in all otherPalestinian cities  are clear indications of the IsraeliGovernment's aggression and violation of internationallaw and norms and of its unwillingness to accept peaceor comply with the international agreements it hassigned.Furthermore  the Palestinian people are stillresisting this ferocious assault with great courage anddetermination  thus asserting their right to fight theoccupation and emphasizing their belief in their justcause  while upholding their legitimate leadership anddefending their national rights  as endorsed by theinternational community  in accordance with SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973)  and otherrelevant resolutions  the latest being Council resolution1397 (2002). They are also upholding the principle ofland for peace and the establishment of an independentPalestinian State on their national land  with Jerusalemas its capital.On the basis of its principles and in support ofjustice  Bahrain has always stood by the brotherlypeople of Palestine. It affirms its full support for theArab peace initiative adopted at the Arab Summit heldat Beirut in March 2002 on the basis of the visionoffered by His Royal Highness Prince Abdullah BinAbdul-Aziz Al-Saud  Crown Prince of the Kingdom ofSaudi Arabia. That vision provides for an end to theMiddle East conflict  the establishment of normalrelations with Israel in exchange for its withdrawalfrom all the occupied Arab territories to the borders of4 June 1967  including withdrawal from the SyrianArab Golan Heights and the remaining Lebaneseoccupied territories  and a just settlement of thequestion of Palestinian refugees in accordance withGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948.The oppression to which the Palestinian peopleare subjected and the ongoing situation that threatenssecurity and peace in the Middle East and the worldrequire immediate intervention by the Security Counciland the international community to stop Israelipractices against the Palestinian people and toreactivate the Arab peace initiative at the regional andinternational levels. That initiative is a viable basis forany move towards the achievement of a just andcomprehensive peace in the region.Bahrain has welcomed the initiative of the UnitedStates Secretary of State with respect to convening apeace conference on the Middle East  on the basis ofideas and principles put forward by the Arab Summit inthe Arab peace initiative and of the relevantinternational resolutions. It hopes that a just andcomprehensive peace in the Middle East will thus beachieved  leading to stability and security  ending thecycle of conflict and violence  and bringing instead acycle of fruitful cooperation among the countries of theregion.Bahrain has also reaffirmed this position bywelcoming the positive ideas in President Bush's 24June 2002 statement on the Middle East. Those ideaswere reiterated in his statement before the GeneralAssembly last Thursday and related to the settlement ofthe Middle East conflict within the framework of theresolutions of international legitimacy  and with a viewto establishing a Palestinian State living side by sidewith Israel in peace and security.The Arab side  through the Arab peace initiativeand by accepting the ideas that President Bush has putforward  has clearly demonstrated its interest insecurity and stability in the region. The Israeli side hasyet to detail what plans it has for peace and whatposition it has taken vis-à-vis the Arab peace initiativeand the ideas put forward by President Bush. What isneeded now is to translate those ideas and initiativesinto plans and practical steps that benefit peace and putan end to the present deteriorating situation.In the light of Bahrain's religious and culturaltraditions  as reflected in our Constitution and nationallaws and as reaffirmed by our policies that focus  interalia  on the right to life  security and peace  we wouldlike to reaffirm our strong rejection of all forms andmanifestations of terrorism. We would also welcomethe convening under United Nations auspices of aninternational conference on terrorism  with a view toreaching an internationally agreed definition ofterrorism that differentiates between unacceptableterrorist acts and legitimate struggle and resistance bypeople against foreign occupation to achieve nationalliberation and self-determination  and to defendthemselves in accordance with the United NationsCharter  to which we adhere in word and deed.The Kingdom of Bahrain has followed with greatinterest the developments in Afghanistan  a countrythat has lacked stability and has suffered the ravages ofwar for many years. We welcome the measures takenby the Government of Afghanistan with a view topromoting security and stability and restoring normallife for its people. We have also cooperated fully withthe Committee established pursuant to Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001) on financial and logisticalmeasures against terrorist activities  in line with theconcept of collective action within the United Nations.Bahrain has supported all initiatives to establishnuclear-weapon-free zones and has supported otherconfidence-building measures in regions such as theMiddle East  where we have supported the creation of azone free of all weapons of mass destruction especially nuclear weapons  in accordance with therelevant General Assembly resolutions. We call uponall our neighbours to support this idea in order torelease resources that could be used for the prosperityand development of peoples. We call on the UnitedNations to exert pressure on Israel to accede to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weaponsand to subject its nuclear facilities to thecomprehensive safeguards system of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency.Dialogue and tolerance among States and peoplescontribute to the promotion of understanding and themaintenance of international peace and security. Basedon that conviction  and emphasizing the importance weattach to General Assembly resolution 53/22 of 16November 1998 concerning the United Nations Year ofDialogue among Civilizations  the Kingdom of Bahrainhas hosted a seminar organized in cooperation with theGovernment of Japan. A number of internationallyknown intellectuals from the Arab and Islamic worldsand from Japan participated in the seminar  which wasconvened last March and was entitled “The Dialogueamong Civilizations: The Islamic World and Japan”.The seminar sought to promote dialogue between Arab-Islamic civilizations and other civilizations so thatdifferent cultures may grow closer to one another.In furtherance of this approach  the Kingdom ofBahrain will also host the tenth session of the Islamic-Christian Dialogue Conference  to be held from 28 to30 October 2002. The objective is to promote betterunderstanding between world religions and cultures and to enhance interaction and exchange in order topreserve the progress that has been made and toinvigorate an informed outlook for the future  whereincooperation in the interest of the entire human race without discrimination  can take place.In conclusion  I would like to state that  thanks tocooperative efforts  the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  recently held in Johannesburg  provideda favourable opportunity for the review and evaluationof achievements made over the past 10 years  theidentification of impediments and challenges  thedevelopment of strategies and the identification ofobjectives and priorities for joint action. It is our hopethat all States will implement the outcome of theJohannesburg Summit and will address the challengesfacing us all  especially the developing States.In that context  the Kingdom of Bahrain wouldlike once again to affirm the importance of practicaland effective implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration with regard to development and the role ofthe international community and internationalorganizations in supporting national efforts in thatfield.We are confident that the United Nations  withthe determination  political will and hard work of itsMember States  is capable of efforts that will help usachieve our shared goals of just peace  economicprosperity and social justice throughout the world. It isin our interest to cooperate with one another to makethe United Nations the main engine of our activities  inorder to achieve a better world: one of peace  security prosperity and justice for all peoples and all States."
"19",766,"BHS",57,2002,"﻿On behalf of PrimeMinister Perry G. Christie  the Government and thepeople of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  Icongratulate you most warmly  Sir  on your election tothe presidency of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. The Bahamas is confident that thissession will be steered to a fruitful conclusion underyour able guidance. You and the other members of yourequally competent Bureau may be assured of the fullsupport of the Bahamas in the performance of yourduties. I take this opportunity also to congratulate yourpredecessor from the Republic of Korea for his skilfulleadership during the fifty-sixth session.The right to self-determination and the full  fairand unhindered expression of the will of the people areprinciples held in the highest esteem by the Bahamas.The Bahamas looks forward to welcoming theDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste to the UnitedNations when it takes its place in the Assembly in justa few weeks. The Bahamas is also pleased to welcomeSwitzerland to this family of nations.The world has agreed that the United Nations is aplace where nations large and small are equal  wheredisputes of an international character may be resolvedpeacefully  and where the use of force is supportedonly in accordance with the United Nations Charter.The Bahamas and all other nations represented herehave signed on to this contract  a contract that  in ourview  is inviolate and must be honoured. This shouldnot be a matter of convenience and  in our view applies to all nations  large and small. Today  I reaffirmthe commitment of the Bahamas to the United NationsCharter and to the Universal Declaration of HumanRights. The Government and the people of theBahamas believe in the United Nations  and willcontinue to support it and to uphold the foundingprinciples on which its effectiveness and successdepends.We reaffirm our commitment to the rule of law and an abiding respect for the right to self-determination  the sovereignty of nations and the rightof people everywhere to expect that their Government freely and democratically elected  will protect theirrights. We urge world leaders to accept that the freelyexpressed will of the people is their sole claim tolegitimacy and that the will of the people should not besubverted by any means. We reject parochialism as ajustification for obfuscating the true intent and will of apeople as expressed through the ballot box.The Government of the Bahamas believes in goodgovernance at all levels as a fundamental human right.As an adjunct to that right  we have committedourselves to deepening our long-standing democratictradition. General elections are not the end of the story.The citizen must continue to have a role in thegovernance of the country. Civil society must beactively encouraged to develop and engage in theaffairs of the country. The Bahamas is committed toconsulting its people on all matters of nationalimportance. This becomes critical as our countryexamines its role and fulfils its obligations to otherMember States on the bilateral and multilateral levels.The first anniversary of the 11 September attackson the World Trade Center in New York and thePentagon  near Washington  D.C.  and the tragedy inPennsylvania  were commemorated just a few daysago. On that occasion  the Bahamas reiterated itscondemnation of those acts as attacks on our valuesand on our civilization. Such acts must not gounpunished. We therefore support measures to bringthe guilty to justice and to prevent similar attacks in alltheir forms and manifestations. We are resolute in ourviews on this. We pause to remember the families andfriends in countries around the world who lost lovedones in those attacks.In our own country we are seeking to recoverfrom the knock-on effects of the unemployment theattacks caused. We are taking steps to rebuild oureconomy. We have initiated changes to our domesticlaw and we have  in the United Nations  theCommonwealth and the Organization of AmericanStates  become parties to international conventions tobolster our capacity to play our necessary role in thefight against these attacks on our way of life. We willcontinue to give our full support to international effortsto eliminate this scourge. At the same time  we are29keen to ensure that in this fight the fundamental rightsand freedoms of our citizens are not eroded.The Bahamas believes that there is no betterlegacy that we can leave to the generations to comethan an Earth that is safe and secure and that cansustain life. We firmly believe that there can bedevelopment without harm to the environment. Weemphasized that point at the World Summit onSustainable Development. The environment is not onlythe biological medium that supports the life of thepeople of the Bahamas  but it is also the central reasonfor our economic success. The Government hastherefore given high priority to preserving andprotecting the environment  and has taken practicalsteps to do so.We reiterate our concern expressed at the Summitabout the threat posed to small island developing Statesby all manifestations of climate change  including therise in sea levels. We have repeatedly expressed ourgrave concern to some of our industrialized partnersabout the trans-shipment of nuclear waste through theCaribbean and about the disastrous effects it mighthave on the economies of the Bahamas and theCaribbean. Tourism is our primary industry. Anaccident involving spent nuclear fuel will almostcertainly destroy it. We do not accept that  because therisk of accidents is remote  the transhipment of nuclearwaste should be allowed to continue. We make theassertion today and ask for the transhipment to cease.The Bahamas joins in urging the early ratificationand implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and inreaffirming its commitment to sustainable developmentand to the Political Declaration and the Plan ofImplementation of the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment.The international community faces a broad rangeof political  economic  social and cultural issues. Wehave made inroads  but not sufficient to stem the spiralof persistence of poverty  hunger  human rights abuses crime and diseases  particularly HIV/AIDS  or toaddress the vulnerability of small island developingStates. The Bahamas is particularly concerned aboutHIV/AIDS and the slow progress in fighting thedisease.The critical question on HIV/AIDS and all theother issues is: Where do we go from here? This bodyhas made important commitments to the world. Thereare reviews  platforms and programmes of action. Ourrespective publics may be forgiven for their cynicismand the criticism levelled that the United Nations is atalking shop. Our view  however  is that it is better totalk than fight. Talking is  in fact  a form of action andthere is no doubt that  with regard to HIVAIDS discussion of the problem is central to the solutions.But our respective publics are looking for and requiremore immediate money and direct action. We must notbe accused of inaction in the face of human sufferingand adversity.We in the Bahamas have ably demonstrated ourdetermination to play our part in these endeavours. Wehave been credited regionally and internationally forour model programmes  particularly in respect to ourtreatment of and efforts to control the spread ofHIV/AIDS. We especially wish to thank the WorldHealth Organization and the Pan American HealthOrganization  now celebrating its hundredth year  forthe cooperation they have extended to the Bahamas andfor their stellar work in the area of international health.We wish to commend the recent initiative to provideantiretroviral drugs to countries of the Caribbean toassist in the fight against HIV/AIDS.The Bahamas is concerned about the presentglobal economic order. We raise questions aboutwhether globalization and trade liberalization canindeed function as vehicles for progressive change inall countries large and small  developed anddeveloping. We are committed to adapting to change but at a pace and in a manner and form that areconsistent with the way we live. The CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM)  of which the Bahamas is apart  has taken up the challenges of ensuring a degreeof stability among its member countries in the face ofglobalization. But the Bahamas believes that more canand must be done to assist our Caribbean Communityto adapt to these externally imposed changes throughequitable and sensitive trade policies and by reform ofthe international financial institutions and their lendingpractices.The Bahamas is the unwitting transit point forillegal activities: the smuggling of human beings andthe illicit trade in narcotic drugs. The United States isthe ultimate target. We are also suffering fromincreased violent crime from guns smuggled into ourcountry from the United States. These guns areterrorizing our society. The Bahamas is workingclosely with the United States and other neighbouringcountries to address these issues. There must be a30stronger effective action to reduce demand for drugs inthe receiving country. There must be more effectiveaction taken to stop the flow of illegal guns.The Bahamas has taken an active interest in thepeace and stability of its sister CARICOM State  Haiti.Given our longstanding and developing relations withHaiti  positive steps taken to provide assistance andsupport for Haiti give us great hope. We are especiallypleased with the efforts of the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank to work with the Government ofHaiti to remove the existing financial hurdles thatimpede development efforts. We also welcome therecent Organization of American States (OAS)resolution and the announcement by the United Statesthat it would contribute additional resources to theOAS special mission in Haiti. Illegal migration fromHaiti causes a serious drain on the resources of theBahamas. In addition to Haitian-Bahamian bilateralefforts to address this problem  the Bahamas believesthat targeted international initiatives  with thecooperation of the Government of Haiti  represent thebest hope for the Haitian people.Illegal immigration from Cuba also adverselyaffects us. The Bahamas continues to call for thenormalization of relations between Cuba and theUnited States of America. We believe that suchnormalization would be central to solving thatdimension of the migration problem.The Bahamas welcomes the entry into force ofthe Rome Statute on 1 July 2002 and the establishmentof the International Criminal Court as a critical tool inthe fight against violations of humanitarianinternational law and crimes against humanity.The conflict between Israel and the Palestinianpeople is a matter of concern. There should be peacebetween them. We support the peaceful settlement ofthis issue in accordance with all applicable UnitedNations resolutions. Every people deserves to have aState to call its own in peace and security.The Bahamas is concerned about developments inAfrica. As part of the African diaspora  we wish to seeAfrica prosper  wars cease and equitable policiesapplied for all of the many and varied people of thatcontinent.We support the reform of the Security Council.The Bahamas believes that the time has come for us totake the hard decisions and to agree to a practicalprogramme of reform that takes fully into account theneed for equitable membership and for a moredemocratic and transparent Council.The Bahamas is a small country whose voice without the indispensable forum provided by theUnited Nations  would be lost or at best ignored. Here irrespective of size and wealth  we have the ability tospeak with equal voice and to vote with equal power onmatters that affect the quality of our lives today andthat will impact the type of world that we leave inplace for future generations. This is why it is vitallyimportant that we preserve and respect the integrity ofthis Organization. Member States are bound to comehere for redress and should not act unilaterally outsidethe bounds of the Charter. The Bahamas reaffirms itscommitment to the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations as enshrined in its Charter. I leave theAssembly with that commitment here today."
"20",791,"BIH",57,2002,"﻿I amgrateful for the opportunity to address the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. Allow me at the23outset to extend my warmest congratulations to Mr. JanKavan on his well-deserved election to the presidency.The tragic events of 11 September have made usreconsider our achievements  real values  and the linksbetween poverty  development  sustainability  respectfor human rights and real progress. Yet  the goalsenvisioned by the perpetrators of those crimes havecertainly not been fulfilled. The world has becomemore united and more determined to fight terrorism asa global threat to the values of civilization. The resultis increased cooperation among specialized servicesand bodies of different States  as well as internationalorganizations. However  we must be prepared for along and exhausting confrontation with this evil of ourtimes.Last year we were all rightly focused onAfghanistan. Today we are concerned also about futuresteps regarding Iraq as a great threat to world stabilityand a shelter for terrorism. Fortunately  after a decadeof being in focus as a crisis area  that South-EasternEurope  the Balkans  along with Bosnia andHerzegovina  as the heart of the region  are no longer“CNN-able”  given the present growing stability.The time has come to salute the new image of mycountry and to start re-branding the perception of theregion as a whole  which no longer fits anymore the“Balkan ghosts” stereotype. Great concerns such asIraq  the Middle East and Kashmir should not let usforget that the Balkan region is bearing good news. Weare all striving to finish the job of fully integrating theregion into European democratic structures and values.Enormous efforts and achievements are behindus  but we have to be careful and patient until stabilitybecomes self-sustainable through the building of jobs justice and functioning institutions  which will holdtogether new democracy.In the light of last year's terrorist attacks on NewYork and Washington  our fragile State — the onlyEuropean State where Muslims represent the majorityreligious group — was confronted with the heavypressure of prejudice regarding a “clash betweencivilizations”. But  as members may know  I come froma State that represented a crossroads of differentcultures and religions  where different civilizationslived for centuries in tolerance and mutual respect.Today we are even more convinced that allproblems can be solved only through dialogue based ongood political will. From that position we have joinedthe fight against terrorism and organized crime of allkinds. We have heightened our struggle againstcorruption by upgrading and strengthening our Stateinstitutions. We have placed the rule of law at the topof the agenda. Good work has been done  results havebeen achieved and we have thus proved that Bosniaand Herzegovina is not a no-man's land.Building democratic institutions  economicdevelopment and the protection and promotion ofhuman rights are more than ever at the top of ourpriorities. Following the recent tragic events and all theturbulent changes that Bosnia and Herzegovina hasexperienced  we strongly believe in the paradigm ofdemocracy  development and peace as the pillars ofprogress and stability for my country  but also for theimmediate neighbourhood and region as well. Onlyresponsible and accountable governance can bringabout necessary changes and progress for all.Unfortunately  we are still confronted with theheavy legacy of the past  and especially with the factthat the main culprits for the crimes committed inBosnia and Herzegovina  Radovan Karadzic and RatkoMladic  are at large. The moment they are brought tojustice  it will be easier to reach our goals. That is whyI would like at this juncture to emphasize theimportance of cooperation by all sides concerned withthe International Criminal Tribunal for the formerYugoslavia in The Hague.At the same time we are aware thatdemocratization is sometimes a long process. Post-conflict peace-building is even more complex. But  wehave set the vision for developing a safe  peaceful stable and self-sustainable country  and we shall notstop half way. Today  we are a full member of theCouncil of Europe. More refugees and displacedpersons have returned in recent times as compared toany other post-war period. In other words  in the last 18months almost three times more properties  homes andapartments were given back to refugees and displacedpersons all over Bosnia and Herzegovina than in theprevious five years. Many roads  many villages  manyroofs were built or repaired; many mosques andchurches have also been built or repaired.The contribution of the United Nations Mission inBosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH)  the StabilizationForce  the High Representative  the PeaceImplementation Council  the Office of the United24Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) the Organization for Security and Co-operation inEurope (OSCE) and others in the family of theinternational community present in Bosnia andHerzegovina has been substantial in achieving thepresent level of stability and reconstruction.We particularly recognize the value and the roleof UNMIBH which is completing its mandate at theend of this year. The police reform and restructuring with a view to meeting international standards oforganizational capacity and institutional integrity represents a clear success. The United Nations Missionin Bosnia and Herzegovina was certainly one of thekey players also in establishing the foundation foreffective  democratic and sustainable law enforcementagencies  a fundamental element for the furtherdevelopment of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a multi-ethnic  tolerant and democratic State. We welcome thetransfer of the remaining tasks in this area to theEuropean Union Police Mission  and especially theextension of the European Union responsibility in thearea of juridical reform as one of the basic pillars ofself-sustainability  future democratization and thereform process.There should be no doubt that the United Nationshas the potential to fulfil its new tasks and thus respondto the ever increasing challenges of the fast-changingworld. It should provide leadership in building aprosperous world  founded no longer on force andthreats  but on the rules of international law and respectfor all rights  and rights for all.In that context I would like to underline that wesupport the further democratization and modernizationof the United Nations. New tasks and challenges callincreasing efficiency  cost rationalization and the equalgeographic participation of States and peoples in theUnited Nations system. Bosnia and Herzegovina alsosupports the continuation of work on reforming theSecurity Council  adjusting its membership inaccordance with carefully designed criteria  taking intoaccount equal geographic representation but notjeopardizing the efficiency of that United Nationsbody.Allow me to briefly mention some of thepriorities of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosniaand Herzegovina has in the past two years proved itsdetermination to move from the position of passive aidrecipient from the international community to theposition of contributor to international efforts. The factthat we are in a position to consider the need or eventhe imperative of taking a more active and creativerole  and thus a bigger share of responsibility  testifiesto the trend of normalization of the situation in thecountry.Reconstruction is taking place and results arevisible in the economy  social reforms  education health care and so on. Economic reforms are directedtowards the establishment of a single economic spaceand also with a view to setting up conditions forupgraded education and thus to offering the choice forour young generations to remain in Bosnia andHerzegovina and become the frontrunners of itsdevelopment and future.We have almost fully completed the conditionsset out in the European Union's road map  which wehope will soon open the process of a feasibility studyfor Bosnia and Herzegovina's signing of a stabilizationand association agreement with the European Union.We have gone through the process of being the objectof international efforts and are now the partner in theprocess of making an economically and institutionallyself-sustainable State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thisis only one phase in a process of finally becoming theowner of the changes in our country.In partnership with the international community we are streamlining a common strategy for politicalstability  institution-building and an economic recoveryprogramme as the precondition of overall sustainabledevelopment. The entire region  including Bosnia andHerzegovina  is entering a new stage of stability andthe European integration process  but we still have tobe on the alert. The ghosts of the past  segregation andwars are losing ground.In following the trials of war criminals before theInternational Criminal Tribunal for the FormerYugoslavia in The Hague  we are bearing witness to thehope that justice and the future will finally buryprojects based on genocide. That is why we have to acton a daily basis against those who are trying to openthe box of drawing new maps or calling for new warsin the region.So much energy and so many efforts of the localand international communities have been invested sofar that we are not even allowed to consider anythingbut a strategy for success. Any type of hypothetical exitstrategy of the international community can be based25only on a success strategy in building one multiethnic democratic and European State of Bosnia andHerzegovina. Once again  I would like to express thegratitude of my Government to the internationalcommunity for its devoted support towards long-lastingstability and development in the region.If the four million people of my country —Muslims  Orthodox Catholics  Jews and others whohistorically lived in tolerance  even in a non-democratic environment — cannot now live in ademocratic and open society in the middle of Europe then the logical question after 11 September is: Howwe can be consolidated and organized among the sixbillion people of our planet?Coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina  I amdriven by the force of optimism and the strength ofvision shared by the overall majority of those who donot want to repeat the past  but are ready to fight forthe future. Jobs  justice for all  solidarity and Europe through reforms and strong state institutions  are theitems on our agenda today. We are determined to turnthese words into deeds."
"21",838,"BLR",57,2002,"﻿Icongratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of this session of the General Assembly. Ibelieve your extensive diplomatic experience willcontinue the successful and useful work done by yourpredecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo.Belarus welcomes the further expansion of thecommunity of nations. We welcome the SwissConfederation to the United Nations membership. Webelieve that the new Member State and the UnitedNations will be good partners and will contribute topeace and progress in the world.The last session of the General Assembly was alandmark for all of us. Last year the world changeddramatically. The challenges of globalization haveturned out to be more serious than they seemed to all ofus when leaders of the Member States adopted theMillennium Declaration.The tragic events of 11 September 2001 were aserious test of the stability of the United Nations andour commitment to the principles and objectives of theCharter. We bow our heads in memory of the victims ofthe terrorist attacks. The American tragedy must neverbe allowed to be repeated anywhere in the world. ThePresident of the Republic of Belarus  AlyaksandrLukashenka  wrote in a letter dated 11 September 2002 to President George Bush of the United States:Today we still bear in our hearts the memory ofthe innocent people who perished in New York Washington and Pennsylvania on that dreadfulmorning of 11 September 2001 ... Early in thetwenty-first century the world perceived the gravereality of new challenges and threats. We alsocame to understand that the evil of internationalterrorism can be eradicated only through jointconcerted efforts.'Today  we have every reason to state that theworld community has managed to confront the threat ofglobal terrorism by creating a broad internationalcoalition. The measures taken by the United Nations inresponse to the unprecedented acts of internationalterrorism mark a new and significant direction in theOrganization's activities.Belarus considers itself an integral part of theanti-terrorism coalition. We fully support the Counter-Terrorism Committee and have been actively involvedwith it in the context of unconditional implementationof Security Council resolutions. We also believe theCounter-Terrorism Committee provides a fruitfulexchange of experience in the area of combatingterrorism that involves the Member States international organizations and regional institutions.The President  Government and Security Councilof the Republic of Belarus have been focusing on waysto combat terrorism. In January 2002  we adopted a lawto combat terrorism  which has entered into force. Our22country is a party to 9 of the 12 major multilateralinternational treaties on combating terrorism. We arenow working on accession to the three other treaties.The outcome of the groundbreaking work of theCounter-Terrorism Committee will serve as a basis forsetting up a universal model for counter-terrorismlegislation and for its implementation.The Republic of Belarus will contribute toelaborating a comprehensive convention on combatinginternational terrorism and acts of nuclear terrorism.Work on those two instruments should be the focus ofthe Secretary-General's attention  since internationalterrorism today has challenged two Powers  twopermanent members of the Security Council: theUnited States and Russia. It has also challenged theentire international community. We have accepted thatchallenge; our response is clear. We  the UnitedNations  will eliminate terrorism.The focus of attention at the last session waspeople and their needs in a global world; we agree withthat approach. The Millennium Declaration is our guideas we work on those issues. We considered possibleoptions for implementing the Millennium Declarationat two recent important international forums  theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment at Monterrey and the World Summit onSustainable Development at Johannesburg. Those twoforums marked a transition between identifyingcommon goals and actually implementing them. Themain task facing this session is to draw conclusionswith regard to that work and determine the specificactions to be taken in order to implement theagreements. Our delegation is ready to act togetherwith other Member States to this end.My Government attaches paramount importanceto integrating environmental and social aspects into ournational strategy for sustainable development.Belarus agrees with the analysis made at theJohannesburg Summit of what has been done toachieve sustainable development over the past decadeand how we can tackle global issues in the twenty-firstcentury.Our country is entering the new millennium as animportant geopolitical element in a modern Europe. Wehave a stable economic and social infrastructure andthe highest human development index among thecountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.Belarus seeks constructive interaction and mutuallybeneficial partnership with our neighbouring countriesin the interest of building a united Europe. Theprospect of sustainable development in Europe cannotbe realized without a stable Belarus acting as a reliableEurasian bridge. On that basis  our President andGovernment have been determining the role thatBelarus will play in the implementation of thedecisions of the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment.The conferences at Monterrey and Johannesburgshowed the importance of taking into account theinterests of countries with transitional economies instructuring a stable world for the twenty-first century.Over the past decade  our countries have come a longway in transitioning to the market economy andintegrating fully into international trade  economic andfinancial systems. But the States in that group are atdifferent stages of macroeconomic and financialstability and sustained economic growth because of theparticular characteristics of their individual situationsowing to internal and external factors.Therefore  it is important to continueinternational efforts to make market reformsirreversible in the countries with transitionaleconomies. We must also take account of and try tomitigate the social consequences and ensure that ourcountries are fully integrated into the world economy.Belarus looks forward to a fruitful discussion of thedraft  which we will be introducing at this session ofthe General Assembly.Sustainable development in Belarus relatesdirectly to dealing with the consequences of theChernobyl disaster  the largest radiation disaster of thepast century. Economic damage in Belarus is estimatedat $US 235 billion. We have invested $US 13 billion inrestoring the social and economic sectors of thatregion. The health of the affected population is still aserious concern. At the same time  Chernobyl-relatedissues have been losing the attention of theinternational community  leaving Belarus to face theconsequences alone. Belarus has urged a shift in focusof international Chernobyl-related cooperation awayfrom humanitarian assistance to socio-economicrehabilitation and sustainable development in theaffected regions.We welcome the active role played by the UnitedNations Under-Secretary-General for HumanitarianAffairs  Mr. Kenzo Oshima  who personally visited the23affected regions earlier this year. We are grateful toSecretary-General Kofi Annan for supporting Mr.Oshima in this endeavour. We welcome the work ofsome members of the United Nations Inter-AgencyTask Force on Chernobyl  who seek to set up anInternational Chernobyl Research Board to study thelong-term consequences of radiation effects on humanbeings and the environment in Belarus.Belarus supports United Nations partnership withnon-governmental organizations and the private sector.We believe this can help to mobilize additionalresources for our purposes. However  voluntaryinitiatives should supplement intergovernmentalagreements  not replace them.Peace  security and stability are prerequisites tosustainable development. But this past year has shownthat international peace and security are still fragile.We witnessed a sharp escalation of confrontation in theMiddle East. This region could become the centre of adangerous collision between civilizations.The Middle East Quartet  with the participation ofthe United Nations  the European Union  the RussianFederation and the United States  inspires someoptimism from the standpoint of the understandingreached by all participants in the peace process thattwo independent states  Israel and Palestine  haveto coexist. This understanding is enshrined in legallybinding documents of the United Nations. Graduallytaking steps to mutual reconciliation throughcontinuous dialogue between the parties involved willhelp  and the United Nations must be active here.There is no alternative to the peace process inAfghanistan. Significant financial  material and humanresources have already been allocated to Afghanistan tohelp to create a new Afghanistan  a stable andpredictable partner in modern international relations.Belarus wishes to make its contribution. Our StateAviation Committee has participated in transportinghumanitarian supplies from Europe to Afghanistan.We believe the establishment of the AfricanUnion was a landmark step for Africa. This majorregional association  with support from theinternational community  will hasten a solution toAfrican problems  particularly ethnic and religiousconflict. Belarus will help to approve projects andprogrammes for economic and humanitariandevelopment in Africa through the United Nations.This year was marked by important agreementson strategic stability. Belarus welcomes the signing inMoscow of the Treaty on Strategic OffensiveReductions between the Russian Federation and theUnited States. We support constructive dialoguebetween the nuclear States in order to create agenuinely safe multi-polar world.International efforts for the entry into force of theComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) mustcontinue. A new impetus must be given to theConference on Disarmament. More work must be doneon reducing conventional weapons.Belarus has contributed to setting up the newsecurity architecture from Vancouver to Vladivostok bydepositing our ratification instruments for the OpenSkies Treaty in November 2001.At this session  we will be proposing a draftresolution entitled Prohibition of the development andmanufacture of new types of weapons of massdestruction and new systems of such weapons'. Wetrust it will be unanimously supported  as it was lastyear in the General Assembly.Belarus believes the Security Council must play akey role in maintaining international peace andsecurity  including the situation of Iraq. Belaruswelcomes the recent decision by the Government ofIraq to allow for the immediate and unconditionalreturn of United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq.Any action or attempt to evade the authority ofthe United Nations Security Council  or any non-fulfilment by States of decisions by the Council  willundermine the legal basis of the existing system ofinternational relations and jeopardize the basis of theinternational legal order.Reform of the United Nations is essential tosuccessfully accomplish its tasks. As a foundingmember  Belarus has always advocated strengtheningthe role of the United Nations. In an era ofglobalization  only an institutionally strongOrganization will be capable of making a genuinelyeffective contribution to coordinating member States'efforts to attain the noble goals enshrined in theCharter.Although there has not been much progress in theWorking Group on Security Council reform and onincreasing the Council's membership  Belaruswelcomes the progress made in improving its working24methods by increasing transparency and having moreopen meetings and briefings. Reform of the GeneralAssembly is also speeding up  and informalconsultations should serve as a basis for effective workat this session.We have been monitoring the work of theEconomic and Social Council  and we welcomeinternal reforms there. We support more interactionbetween the Economic and Social Council  the SecurityCouncil and the General Assembly. We welcome thecoordinating role of the Council as set forth in theCharter and the Millennium Declaration.As we look at what we have done and whatremains to be done  we inevitably reach the conclusionthat there is little time for thought due to the speed atwhich the world is changing today; therefore  webelieve that the only key to success is to purposefullymove forward to solve specific tasks. Belarus will worktogether with other member States to that end."
"22",873,"BLZ",57,2002,"﻿On 21 September 1981Belize joined the community of nations as anindependent country  and we the people of Belizeenthusiastically embraced our role as a partner in thecommunity of nations.The United Nations played a pivotal role insecuring Belize's right to self-determination  and  aswe commemorate our independence  we express ourappreciation and continued support for the work of theOrganization.Since its inception in 1945 our United Nationshas  like all of us  been grappling with the constantchanges in our world. In its imperfection it has enduredthe problems of infancy  puberty and adolescence. Eachadjustment provided occasions for learning andopportunities for growth. No  we have not alwaysgrown for the better; and we have suffered the cost ofour mistakes.Still the United Nations endured  for theprinciples of the Charter will reverberate as loudlytomorrow as they do today and did yesterday. Our rightto live peaceful and dignified lives holds as true todayas it did in 1945.Two years ago world leaders assembled here inNew York in an effort to rejuvenate the United Nations.This resulted in the Millennium Declaration andbrought forth the Millennium Development Goals.In these instruments we acknowledged thegrowing abyss between the few with plenty and themany with nothing. We made new commitments andreaffirmed old ones. We renewed yet again our ultimategoal of the improvement of humanity  a goal which weundoubtedly hold as sacred.Since then we have held many meetings andconferences where we have merely recycled ideas andvisions. Now we must aim for higher standards andmake the case that  as a global community  we areobligated to account for how we have chosen toimplement the many commitments we have made.For us implementation is a function of resources;good governance  both locally and globally; sharedresponsibility; and partnerships. The implementation ofthe Millennium Declaration can be effective onlythrough the participation and cooperation of allrelevant stakeholders.In order to ensure that the process ofimplementation is democratized  inclusive  transparentand accountable  we must act with sharedresponsibility and in partnerships of mutual respect andequality. As we follow the road map for theimplementation of the Millennium Declaration  ourdeliberations and  even more so  our commitment to theMonterrey Consensus and to the Plan ofImplementation of the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment should result in meaningful change thatwill improve the lives of our poorest peoples.On 5 February 2002  Belize hosted the first-everCaribbean Community (CARICOM)  System of CentralAmerican Integration (SICA) and Dominican Republicsummit. In the joint declaration issued at theconclusion of the summit  the Caribbean and CentralAmerican leaders agreed to strengthen theircooperation and to coordinate actions in areas such aseducation  health  poverty elimination  environment trade and investment. Shortly our Foreign Ministersshall conclude a Plan of Action to implement the goalsset out in the declaration.The present development paradigm requiresdynamic partnerships. Belize intends to play its part inencouraging closer collaboration and cooperationbetween Central America and the Caribbean.A major hindrance to development is conflict; itis costly and causes unnecessary pain and suffering often to innocent victims. My delegation is concernedabout any notion that violence could be a solution toconflict. History has taught us that lasting peace cannever be constructed in a climate of vengeance.In this regard we express our grave concern overthe continuing deterioration of relations in the MiddleEast  especially with respect to the Palestinian people.The escalation of violence in the region demonstratesthe urgent need for the parties to resume peacenegotiations.The universally endorsed vision of two States Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace withinsecure and recognized borders  as called for by theSecurity Council in resolution 1397 (2002)  should berealized as soon as possible.We encourage the efforts of the United Nations infacilitating a peaceful resolution to the question ofWestern Sahara and support the Settlement Plan as aviable political solution to the dispute.Conflict in its many manifestations finds itsbreeding ground in human desperation  frailty andignorance. If we can address the needs of thedisaffected and the vulnerable  then we can stamp outthe embers of conflict and increase the potential forinternational peace and security. Yes  we must addressthose conditions according to our national capacity  butwe cannot go it alone. A multilateral approach isimperative.Belize continues to look to the United Nations forthe global enforcement of human rights standards. On 1July 2002  the international community witnessed theentry into force of the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. As a State Party to theStatute  my Government will abide by its legalobligations thereunder and will uphold the integrity ofthe Court. It is our hope that all peace-loving and law-abiding nations of the world will become parties to theRome Statute so that the universal jurisdiction of theCourt can be realized. The Court presents the hope thatthere will be an end to impunity for the perpetrators ofgenocide  of other crimes against humanity and of warcrimes. We see this as the start of a new system ofinternational justice.At this session of the General Assembly  we willbe witnessing the expansion of the representativecharacter of the United Nations. We recognize thetremendous contribution that the Swiss Confederationhas made in international relations  particularly withrespect to human rights and humanitarian issues. Itsdecision to become a full member of the UnitedNations will greatly enhance our work.Likewise  we are pleased to welcome theDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste to our family ofnations. Its struggle has been long and arduous  and itsadmission is a testament to the indispensable role ofthe United Nations.It is our wish that the United Nations be theforum for the representation of all peoples of the world including the 23 million people of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan. We must give true meaning to theprinciple of universality set forth in the Charter and more specifically  to the affirmation therein of our faithin fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worthof the human person  in the equal rights of men andwomen and of nations large and small.With the support of the United Nations  Belizebecame an independent nation. Before and after that12time  we made every effort to resolve the territorialdispute between Belize and Guatemala  which we hadinherited from colonial times. All previous attemptshad proved futile  but in March 2000  at the start of thismillennium  Guatemala and Belize agreed to initiate aunique process to resolve the dispute. Each of usappointed a Facilitator and asked the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS)to be honour witness to the process.I am happy to be able to announce that  justyesterday  at OAS headquarters  the Facilitatorspresented their proposals for a peaceful and definitiveresolution of the territorial dispute. The proposals mustbe submitted by referenda to the peoples of bothcountries  and only if accepted by both countries willthey be translated into treaties of settlement that willbring this age-old dispute to an end and create betterconditions for harmonious cooperation between the twocountries  something for which both our peoplesyearn. We fervently hope that that will indeed come topass.An essential aspect of the proposal involves adevelopment trust fund  and we wish to thank all thecountries that will generously contribute to makingpossible the peaceful settlement of a territorial disputethat has adversely affected relations not only betweenthe countries involved  but also between the twosubregions to which Belize belongs  the Caribbeanand Central America.Four days from today  our people will assembleand re-enact the events of our Independence Day. Itwill also be a time to renew our commitment to theprinciples of justice and liberty  to the right of a peopleto self-determination  to the right to development andto our continued commitment to live in peace with ourneighbours. That is the legacy of the United Nations;that is our just objective."
"23",920,"BOL",57,2002,"﻿I wouldlike to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his deservedelection as President of the General Assembly at thissession. We wish him every success. I would also liketo pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  whose efforts to promote peace andcooperation among nations are invaluable. Yesterday in this city  we remembered the victims of a horrendousattack that was the very image of intolerance andfanaticism and revealed the darkest drives of humannature. I was deeply moved by this event and feel dutybound on behalf of my compatriots to express our pain sorrow  and solidarity with those lost loved ones  andto all the citizens of the United States at this time ofaffliction.This terrible episode in history ought  however  toprompt us to rethink a number of dogmas concerningthe current world paradigm for development  dogmasthat prevent it from being sustainable over time  andwhich  like a dangerous mirage  may lead the whole ofhumankind into a collapse that could jeopardize ourcommon future.I say this from the standpoint of a country  which in its small way  is joining the collective endeavour tosolve key problems that involve the fate of the wholeplanet. I am also convinced that it is in the poorcountries of the world that the destiny of all is at stake.What we do  but above all what is done by those whopossess more  and have put into effect a specific visionof society and of the economy that prevails today  shalldetermine whether our path will be one of hope or ofcatastrophe for all.On 9 April 1952  50 years ago  Bolivia tookthe lead in a revolution that sought to democratizepolitics and end economic  social and ethnic exclusion in order to attain a fairer national community. For thepast 20 years we have kept that democracy functioningand we have been a pioneer nation in regulating oureconomy. Today  this process based on stability anddialogue is continuing.However  all that has been done is stillinsufficient. The road that lies ahead is very long  andwe must travel it amidst crises and turmoil from whichwe have been unable to extricate ourselves. The socialand economic problems we face are serious. Much ofwhat we have achieved could be destroyed by pressureexerted by those  who in spite of everything  have beenmarginalized and excluded. This situation is rooted inoverwhelming poverty  the unfair distribution ofwealth  and the loss of faith in politicians  associatedwith corruption and the lack of answers to pressingdaily problems.Our team became the Government of Bolivia as aresult of a popular vote only thirty-six days ago  andwe are committed to tackling these risks and challengeswith resolution. We are doing this within theframework of a new democratic landscape. Theelection of 30 June 2002 established a new parliamentthat is diverse; this took place without violence ordramatic disruption and within a context of democraticand political maturity. Its main effect has been to beginto dismantle the walls of exclusion  on the basis of therecognition of others and tolerance and respect fordifferent visions of the world.For the first time in our history  an essential partof Bolivia's population  the Quechuas  Aymaras andGuaranis  are represented in fair proportion. Apluralistic legislative branch in ethnic  economic political and social respects is a promising setting forcourageous dialogue about our ongoing problems. Ourunswerving resolve is that this dialogue should be realand productive  because it will help us to find a way ofworking together on the political and social levels while seeking to resolve these crises and workingsincerely to break the long-standing social exclusion ofindigenous people and discrimination against women children  and older persons.I would like particularly to mention the resolve ofour Government to make combating corruption a statepolicy. Only genuine and resolute efforts in this area24will make it possible for Bolivia to overcome one ofthe greatest impediments to development  one thatthreatens to destroy the essential foundation of oursociety. This resolve is part of a historic coursefollowed  despite their different positions  by twoparties in Bolivia: the Nationalist RevolutionaryMovement and the Revolutionary Left Movement.Their leaders  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and JaimePaz Zamora  have understood that  at such a time  it isnecessary to set aside legitimate party interests andlong-standing political differences in order to build aproject of responsibility vis-‡-vis Bolivia. This is theonly response possible for our nation at such a historicmoment. This decision led to an alliance that has givenrise to Plan Bolivia aimed at tackling the crisis bymeans of an ambitious programme of public investmentthat will stimulate the economy  encourage privateinputs  create jobs  and reduce social inequities byfavouring the most vulnerable sectors of our society.Plan Bolivia also seeks to respond to the complexchallenges of globalization  redefine the role of theState in promoting sustainable development  respond tolocal and regional demands  and establish a full rule oflaw with robust and credible institutions.We know that we are not alone in this; we haveseen such ideas elsewhere in recent decades. In spite ofthis  we urgently require our efforts to be backed by theinternational community. Bolivia has undertaken withdetermination the struggle to combat illicit drugtrafficking as a moral imperative  in which we trulybelieve; but  in doing so  it has paid a high price interms of human lives  economic effects  and violentsocial conflict. It is only right that those countrieswhere drug consumption has greatest impact demand as you know is the key factor in this cycle give us support in proportion. We continue to fulfil ourcommitments. But we urgently call on the internationalcommunity to fully endorse the concept of sharedresponsibility  which has been fostered and promotedin this forum more than once.A combination of internal efforts andinternational support to attain reasonable levels ofsustainable social and economic development must bereached through a new logic that reformulates all ofour earlier ideas of progress and development.Our afflicted Latin America was yesterday thehope of the planet and today is a continent caught in anemergency situation  with widespread social pressure and economic collapse and facing a dangerous threat ofan international domino effect. From its modestposition  our country wishes to help halt these trendsby being an example of how creative and democraticsolutions can be used to address problems andovercome differences. This prompts us to emphasizethat the most effective international aid is that whichrespects the decisions and plans of the countries thatmust use them. Imposing strict and unilateral recipesusually generates more problems than it solves.If equity is one of the first demands ofhumankind today  there is no better system than that ofequitable international trade. Poor countries demandaccess for their products to the markets of the richcountries under adequate conditions. This is one of thekey points of nexus of poverty and social tensions inthe most disadvantaged countries and their population.That is why the Andean Trade Preference Actconstitutes a step forward; although only conditional  itshows the will of a friendly nation to modify a stillunfair relationship.We must understand free trade from a newstandpoint  where the rules of the game are designedrationally to bridge the gap between the rich and thepoor  a situation that has already reached scandalouslevels. It is unacceptable for prosperous nations toimpose limits on us  while they are not prepared toapply them within their own territories.I cannot conclude this intervention withoutreaffirming that recovering our status as a country witha coastline on the Pacific Ocean constitutes animportant factor of our foreign policy.This claim  which we have made for the past 123years  is not the product of stubbornness or whim; it isrelated to our insufficient economic resources and tothe enormous geographical barriers that affect ourcompetitiveness. The lack of direct access to the seaconstitutes an obstacle to our growth and to the welfareof our citizens. The recovery of sovereign access to thesea is not only a matter of justice  but an ineluctableneed for which we shall continue to seek the solidarityand support of the community of nations  and evenmore so now that century-old conflicts of this naturehave been resolved in this new century.Bolivia is part of the world and  through vigorousparticipation within its region  will continue tocontribute to a profound process of reflection regardingthe type of global society that we must  wish to and can25build  based on its experiences and its own formulasfor integrating and for making its own societyparticipative.We are probably experiencing one of the mostdifficult moments since the end of the cold war and ithas become necessary for us to be able to imagine adifferent and better world in which no idea isuntouchable and no hope for change is smothered."
"24",967,"BRA",57,2002,"I congratulate you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly. I thank your predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for the leadership he displayed at a particularlycritical moment for the Organization.To Secretary-General Kofi Annan  I reaffirmBrazil’s confidence in his statesmanship.I have the pleasure of greeting the entry of EastTimor into the fold of the United Nations  just as wewelcomed it last July in Brasilia into our Communityof Portuguese-Speaking Countries. A free Timor is aremarkable United Nations success story.Brazil also welcomes Switzerland  as it has nowbecome a full member of this global political forum.I come to this Hall as the representative of acountry that has faith in the United Nations and thatviews multilateralism as the guiding principle ofrelations among States. This is a conviction we holddear at all times  good and bad. We are at a particularlydifficult juncture for the Organization. This momentcalls for measures sustained by the principles andvalues on which the United Nations was founded.Brazil has defended them since the first internationalconferences of the twentieth century.We have never let ourselves be tempted by theargument of power. Rather  we have been guided by thepower of argument. This has been the foreign policy ofPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Throughout theeight years of the two terms of office to which he hasbeen democratically elected  certain fundamentalguidelines have been recurrent: fostering democraticdecision-making; overcoming the governance deficit ininternational relations; designing a new financialarchitecture and providing effective solutions forvolatility in capital flows; defending a multilateraltrade regime that is both fair and balanced — hence the importance of the World Trade Organization and ofthe Doha mandate; correcting the distortions resultingfrom economic globalization that is not accompaniedby a corresponding process of political and institutionalglobalization; and affirming the value of human rightsand sustainable development. These are challenges thatwe cannot face alone.For this reason  President Fernando HenriqueCardoso has sought to strengthen the Common Marketof the South  together with South American integration as instruments for peace  cooperation and greatercompetitiveness among our countries. Similarly President Cardoso has promoted the development ofpartnerships in all continents  pursuing well-balancednegotiations for the establishment of free trade areas  inparticular with the European Union  as well as with thecountries taking part in the Free Trade Area of theAmericas process.We are committed to seeing the entry into forceof the Kyoto Protocol and the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court; to furthering the socialdevelopment agenda; and to moving forward onnuclear and conventional disarmament. The Brazilianvision of the world under the leadership of PresidentFernando Henrique Cardoso expresses goals not just ofGovernment  but also of the entire country and society.That is why the electoral process now under way willfurther strengthen democracy in Brazil and highlightthe country’s international credentials.Our commitment to the United Nations and tomultilateralism will not waver “in times of storm andblustery winds”  to quote Camões  the great poet of thePortuguese language. The greater the challenges  suchas those facing us at this difficult juncture  the greaterthe need for answers grounded in legitimacy —legitimacy born of participation and consensus.Cooperation must be our modus operandi.In the multilateral sphere  leadership is crucial tothe tasks before us. We are clearly aware of that  yetthe form and content of each task must be definedthrough dialogue. Only through dialogue will acoalition of truly united nations be built — nationsunited by the power of persuasion. The tangledinterests that form a global web of interdependence canbe managed only through authority rooted inmultilateral institutions and in respect for internationallaw. The commitment to negotiated settlements  underthe aegis of multilateralism  must be upheld.At the time of the 11 September terrorist attacks this Organization immediately showed its solidaritywith the United States of America by adoptingresolutions of the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil. At the regional level  the Inter-AmericanTreaty of Reciprocal Assistance was invoked on aBrazilian initiative as an expression of our firmrepudiation and condemnation of all barbaric acts ofterrorism and of our solidarity with the United States.These responses have taken the form of renewedcollaboration in security  intelligence  police andjudicial cooperation issues.Lasting solutions to terrorism  international drug-trafficking and organized crime require careful andpersistent efforts to set up partnerships and cooperativearrangements consistent with the United Nationsmultilateral system.Many countries and regions have been burdenedwith the costs of globalization  while at the same timebeing deprived of its benefits. The very same free flowof capital that can foster investment is responsible forspeculative attacks against national currencies andbalance of payment crises  with negative impact on thecontinuity of public policies and on the alleviation ofsocial ills.Protectionism and all forms of barriers to trade both tariff and non-tariff  continue to suffocatedeveloping economies and to nullify thecompetitiveness of their exports. Liberalization of theagricultural sector has been nothing more than apromise repeatedly put off to an uncertain future.5A/57/PV.2The globalization to which we aspire requiresreform of economic and financial institutions. It mustnot be limited to the triumph of the market.A modern understanding of development mustencompass the protection of human rights  be they civiland political or economic  social and cultural. In thisrespect  the appointment of Sergio Vieira de Mello asthe new United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights is a great honour for all Brazilians. Hesucceeds Mary Robinson  whose importantachievements deserve recognition.The United Nations was created to maintainpeace and security. However  armed conflicts andpockets of irrational violence persist today.The situation in the Middle East underscores howdistant we still are from the international orderimagined by the founders of the United NationsCharter.Brazil supports the creation of a democratic secure and economically viable Palestinian State  aswell as the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. Brazil defends the right of the State ofIsrael to exist within recognized borders and of itspeople to live in security. These are essentialprerequisites for lasting peace in the Middle East. Onlyby mutually and comprehensively acknowledging theconflicting legitimacies in the region  as well as bybuilding on existing agreements  can we staunch theindiscriminate destructiveness of violence and forge away forward.The use of force at the international level isadmissible only once all diplomatic alternatives havebeen exhausted. Force must be exercised only inaccordance with the Charter of the United Nations andin a manner consistent with the determinations of theSecurity Council. Otherwise  the credibility of theOrganization will be undermined in a way that will notonly be illegitimate  but that will also give rise tosituations of precarious and short-lived stability.In the specific case of Iraq  Brazil believes that itis incumbent upon the Security Council to determinethe measures necessary to ensure full compliance withrelevant resolutions. The Security Council’s exercise ofits responsibilities is the way to reduce tensions and toavoid risking the unpredictable consequences resultingfrom wider instability.In Angola the international community mustsupport recent positive developments that open the wayto the rebuilding of the country and the consolidationof peace and democracy.Strengthening the system of collective securityremains a challenge. The Security Council needsreform in order to enhance its legitimacy and lay thefoundations for more solid international cooperation inbuilding a just and stable international order. A centralfeature of this reform should be the expansion of thenumber of members  both in the permanent and non-permanent categories.Brazil has already made it known — and Ireaffirm it here — that it is ready to contribute to thework of the Security Council and to assume all itsresponsibilities.For Brazil  the United Nations is the public spacefor the creation of power  which  according to HannahArendt  can result only from the human capacity to actin concert. The United Nations is the crucial hinge increating a global governance focused on moreequitable distribution of the dividends of peace andprogress.Therein lies our vision for the future  a vision ofsolidarity among peoples and nations  a vision madelegitimate by renewed and inclusive understanding ofpower.We are inspired by the observation ofGuicciardini  the politically more successful Florentinecontemporary of Machiavelli: “Among men  hope isnormally more powerful than fear”."
"25",1011,"BRB",57,2002,"﻿It is my pleasure to joinwith preceding speakers in congratulating you  Sir  onyour election to preside over the General Assembly atits fifty-seventh session. Barbados pledges its fullestcooperation in the year ahead.I also take this opportunity to convey our deepestappreciation to Mr. Han Seung-soo for his leadershipduring a very challenging fifty-sixth session.We  too  wish to welcome the Swiss Confederationand look forward to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste's joining this family of nations.The Preamble to the Charter of this Organizationexpresses in the simplest yet most eloquent of termsthe essential goals of multilateralism. We know itsevery phrase and recognize its solemn commitment“to promote social progress and better standardsof life in larger freedom”as well as“to practice tolerance and live together in peacewith one another as good neighbours and to uniteour strength to maintain international peace andsecurity”.These goals remain as relevant today  and yet  in manyways  as painfully elusive as they were in 1945.In January 2001  the international communityushered in a new century with the highest ofexpectations for the successful implementation of themillennium development goals  which we had justadopted. We were resolved to work with renewedvigour to eradicate poverty and hunger  fight thescourge of HIV/AIDS and disease  raise the level ofhuman development and bring an end to debilitatingeconomic and social injustices. Tragically  the events29of 11 September 2001 eclipsed our millennium visionand brutally reshaped the global agenda.In the intervening year  we have been forced tore-examine our traditional notions of security and tocome to terms with the reality of our growing politicaland economic interdependence. For no single nationcan hope to have all the answers to the complex issuesthat confront us and no lasting solutions are possibleexcept through collective effort. If nothing else  thelessons of 11 September have served to reinforce thevalue of multilateralism.For the past several years  Barbados has arguedfor a redefinition of the concept of security to embracethe new and non-traditional threats that have thegreatest potential to cause harm to our citizens destabilize our societies and erode the basic institutionsof governance. At the hemispheric level  we promoteddialogue on these issues among foreign ministers of theOrganization of American States at our recent GeneralAssembly session in Barbados  where we adopted theDeclaration of Bridgetown on the multidimensionalapproach to hemispheric security. We believe that thisapproach to security is equally valid in the widerinternational context.As we are well aware  threats to world peace areno longer exclusively found in military conflictbetween opposing countries  where the enemy isrecognized and a state of war formally declared.Today's greatest sources of instability and threats tonational  regional and international security lie in areaswhere the enemies are often unidentified non-Stateactors with global reach. Terrorism is but one of thoseinsidious new elements. We are equally alarmed by thegrowing danger posed to democratic societies andGovernments by the modern transnational phenomenaof narco-trafficking  organized crime  money-laundering  corruption and illicit trafficking in smallarms and light weapons. We are also aware of thepotential for grave economic and social dislocationposed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic  environmentaldegradation and ecological and natural disasters. Inaddition  the inequitable application of the benefits oftrade liberalization has created the very real prospect ofincreasing poverty and further economicdisenfranchisement for the smallest and most vulnerablecountries in the developing world. Under thecircumstances  we have little choice but to persist in thestruggle to gain international acceptance for our demandsfor special and differential treatment to prepare our smalleconomies to meet the challenges of globalization.Modern threats to international peace and securityconstrain the capacity for political and economicdevelopment and social progress. All nations share inthe responsibility to respond to those threats  but wecan only do so successfully through collectivestrategies  which address all aspects of the problemsimultaneously. Diversion of resources and attentionfrom the development agenda to the fight againstterrorism cannot produce lasting results. As Dr.Brundtland warned in 1992  our global village may yetbecome a global jungle if States adopt unilateralmeasures to combat global problems.Small developing countries are beset daily byfundamental challenges to their economicsustainability. From our perspective  security has ofnecessity revolved around policies in support of socialdevelopment  economic viability  good governance andthe promotion of democracy. For us  militaryengagement is not an affordable option.For Barbados  as for all small States  the doctrineof non-intervention is of paramount importance for oursurvival. Pre-emptive unilateral action  no matter whatthe apparent cause  is a precedent that occasions in usthe gravest discomfort. It is  therefore  vital that  at thisdangerous and uncertain juncture in world affairs  wereaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and to thepre-eminent role of the United Nations in seeking toimpose responsible behaviour through diplomacy anddialogue rather than through the use of force.In response to the events of 11 September and tothe mandates of Security Council resolution 1373(2001)  Barbados has deployed considerable financialand human resources to the anti-terrorism effort. InMay this year  our Parliament adopted comprehensivedomestic legislation  which entailed an amendment toour Constitution  to criminalize acts of terrorism andsupport or financing for such acts. Yesterday Ideposited with the United Nations Secretariat therelevant instruments to make Barbados a party to theInternational Convention for the Suppression ofTerrorist Bombings and the International Conventionfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.We have been prompt and responsible in fulfillingour obligations to the international community in thatregard  despite the heavy financial strain that hasplaced on our national economy  already deeply30affected by the adverse impact of 11 September on itsmajor productive sectors — tourism and financialservices. As I reminded the General Assembly lastyear  small countries like my own are not part of theproblem  but we are committed to being part of thesolution  in circumstances that place a disproportionateburden on our financial  human and administrativeresources  already struggling to respond to the globaleconomic recession.Regrettably  that burden has been furtherexacerbated by the words and actions of somelawmakers who now seek  through misguided zeal  tobrand the operations of financial services centres  eventhe most transparent and well regulated  such as theBarbados regime  as havens for corporate tax evasionand for the laundering of terrorist assets. It is importantto emphasize that the Barbados jurisdiction is moretransparent and better regulated than many in thedeveloped world  and certainly no less so than whatobtains in the states of Delaware and Vermont  amongothers. My country fully intends to defend itsreputation against those renewed  unwarranted duplicitous and discriminatory attacks.In this post-11 September  post-Doha  post-Enronworld  many of the assumptions about peace andprogress in a globalized economy have beenchallenged. We have entered a prolonged internationalrecession  whose consequences have impacted on allcountries. It is trying times such as these that forcepolicy makers at the national level to simplify  refocusand prioritize.It is opportune for us to undertake a similarexercise in respect of the United Nations. We mustreturn this Organization to its basic mandate  and seekto have its energies and focus redirected towardssubstantive action in the twin areas of peace anddevelopment. The unique attributes of the UnitedNations and its multilateral structure can serve to buildconsensus and promote cooperation in the search forsolutions to the most pressing problems affectinghuman security.The international summits and globalconferences  which have proliferated over the lastdecade  have been successful in mobilizingGovernments and  to a greater extent  civil society  aswell as sensitizing people to the most compellingdevelopment issues facing the planet. Although theyhave created awareness and raised expectations  theyhave not delivered with respect to implementation  andmost of their fiercely negotiated plans of action remainunder-funded and under-executed. The promises andpledges of the past 15 years have not been fulfilled. Itis high time that we review the utility of those costlyprocesses and seek simpler  more effective structures tocarry forward our development agenda. The dwindlingresources available for developmental programmes arebetter used for development itself than for scripteddialogue to discuss the process of development.Fundamental changes are needed in the way thatdevelopment is financed  and in the structure  operationand coherence of the global financial architecture.Monterrey must not become just another failed process.Barbados welcomed recognition by the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development of the vulnerabilityand sustainable development challenges of small islanddeveloping States  and looks forward to a frank comprehensive review of the implementation of theBarbados Plan of Action in Mauritius in 2004. TheSummit made a commitment to the sustainablemanagement of ocean space  and it is in this vein thatBarbados will continue to work towards achievinginternational recognition of the Caribbean Sea as a“special area” in the context of sustainable development.For Barbados  our greatest resource lies in thecreativity and resilience of our people. We arepersuaded that the betterment of the human condition isthe fundamental objective of economic progress. TheHIV/AIDS pandemic rates with terrorism and narco-trafficking as one of the major new and emergingthreats to human security. According to informationprovided by the Pan American Health Organization there are currently 2.8 million people living withHIV/AIDS in the Americas. Of that number  420 000live in the wider Caribbean  accounting for over 2 percent of its adult population. In response to theinternational Declaration of Commitment  Barbadoshas established a target of a 50 per cent reduction in theHIV/AIDS mortality rate and in the incidence of thedisease over the next three years. We are also workingtowards the enactment of appropriate anti-discriminatory legislation by 2006. Our NationalCommission continues to support the Pan-CaribbeanPartnership against HIV/AIDS  which is coordinatedby the Caribbean Community Secretariat. Barbados isone of four English-speaking Caribbean countriesselected to participate in the Caribbean HIV/AIDSRegional Training Initiative. The World Bank  of31whose programmes Barbados is a graduate  madespecial provisions for the securing of a $15.1 millionloan to procure the highly active anti-retroviral therapyprogramme for HIV-positive Barbadians  free of cost atpoint of delivery.Barbados' commitment to the principles andpurposes of the United Nations Charter has beenunwavering over its three and a half decades ofmembership in this Organization. We have paid ourcontributions faithfully and have consistentlysupported the Organization's efforts to promote andprotect human rights  to eradicate poverty and tocultivate a global culture of peace.A tangible demonstration of that commitment wasmade on 2 January of this year  when the PrimeMinister of Barbados had the honour of officiallyhanding over to the United Nations Secretary-General for the exclusive use of the United Nations agenciesoperating in the Eastern Caribbean  a custom-designedcommon premises building  now known as UnitedNations House. Secretary-General Annan's personalpresence in Barbados for the inauguration ceremonywas interpreted by Prime Minister Arthur as a clearexpression of his understanding that every part of theUnited Nations family matters and that the contributionof the small States of the Caribbean to the objectives ofthe Organization is not without significance. For in thewords of the Secretary-General  small States have becomethe backbone of the Organization in terms of their supportand encouragement for the multilateral process.The principles which guarantee a better quality oflife for all peoples lie within our Charter. The globallandscape has undergone tremendous change in the last57 years  but the ideals of the Charter are indelible.Today we revisit this place to recommit to a processwhich  admittedly  is not perfect  but it is all that standsbetween us and anarchy. It is still our greatest hope forpeace  development and social justice. In ourgeneration  we cannot be expected to complete themonumental task which lies before us  but neither arewe at liberty to abstain from it."
"26",1043,"BRN",57,2002,"﻿Mr. President  I extend my congratulations to you andto the people of the Czech Republic on your election. Ioffer my very best wishes in all your work during thecoming session.I would also like to thank my colleague  HisExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic ofKorea  our regional neighbour  for his leadership of theGeneral Assembly over the past year.Also  may I congratulate the Government and thepeople of the Swiss Confederation on their decision tojoin the United Nations. They have long given verydistinguished support to the institutions of world peace and it will be good to work with them here.At the same time  I would like to welcome thecoming membership of our neighbour  the DemocraticRepublic of East Timor. In doing so I would like to thankall the members of the United Nations TransitionalAdministration in East Timor. We are very grateful fortheir fine work there. I assure you that we will be doingour best to consolidate those United Nations efforts forpeace in our region. It has been a pleasure workingwith President Gusmão and his new Government. Asthey plan their future development  we look forward tocontinuing this work  not only bilaterally as friends andneighbours  but also through the long-standing processof consultation and cooperation we have establishedwithin our regional association.I mention this aspect of our regional work for aspecific reason. It is the main point I wish to make atthis time. The process I refer to has been at the heart ofthe work of the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN) since its founding well over 30 yearsago. It is not confined to our neighbours in South-EastAsia. It also involves dialogue partners from all overthe world as well as all the permanent members of theSecurity Council. It now covers the whole spectrum ofcooperation: political  economic  functional and  sincethe end of the cold war  all aspects of securitycooperation. In other words  it is a comprehensiveapproach to modern regional and international affairs.It comprises many layers of cooperation boundtogether by one institution  the United Nations. Anenormous amount of work has gone into it. That is whywe place equally enormous value on it. We believe itoffers a secure way forward for every citizen werepresent.I make this point for reasons that deeply concernevery one of our colleagues here. In the past year wehave been made brutally aware of one terrible fact. Thewhole process of consultation and cooperation is nowthreatened. The opportunities it presents to our peopleare profoundly at risk. Like our fellow Members of thisOrganization  we have had to accept a grim reality.There is a dark side to the international life we sharetoday: to globalization  to development  to progress  toknowledge and even to the beliefs we cherish  whetherthey be religious  political or social.We have been taken to this dark side. It is apitiless  bleak and miserable landscape. There is nopath through it along which nation-States can safelyproceed. It is  in that sense  a terrifying vision. InSouth-East Asia we have responded to it as such. Wehave deeply mourned the innocent victims of terrorismin America  Africa  Europe and Asia. We havecondemned all who took those lives.We are  however  trying to move beyondcondemnation. We have taken many immediate andpractical short-term measures. We have committedourselves to long-term action. We have had to do this.Without security and stability  there is little chance for usto implement the far-reaching programme of developmentwe have set for ourselves. So  in no way can we permitthose who engage in any form of terrorism to succeed.By this  I mean any group that tries to drag ouraffairs across to their dark side: not just extremists  nomatter what cause they claim to represent  but alsothose who seek to corrupt international systems oftrade  commerce  and banking or who wilfully destroyour environment or who trade in human misery. Theystand in the way of the deepest interests of the peoplewe represent here  the people for whom the UnitedNations is the direct opposite of the dark vision of theterrorist. It offers them a totally different side of worldaffairs: one that rejoices in the diversity of peoples cultures and beliefs; one that at all times seeks theconsensus that comes out of dialogue and negotiation;and one where informed direction is given to the greatchanges that are sweeping through all societies — in otherwords  the bright side of international affairs lit by abeacon of hope. That is how we see this Organization.We want our regional efforts to help fuel thisbeacon. We want them to complement the work of theUnited Nations.So  put simply  we see only one permanentagenda item here: How can the world body give hopeand purpose to the lives of every family in everycommunity in each of its 190 Member nations?That is why we strongly support the efforts beingmade by the Secretary-General to express our purposein that way  not in the language of confrontation thatwas heard throughout the last century or in theappalling vocabulary of terrorism  but in the humanterms offered at the Millennium Summit.In short  our hopes include an end to historicalinjustices  especially those which our brothers inPalestine continue to suffer  and a determined effort tohelp communities earn a good living in a responsiblemanner. Those were the basic hopes I believe we allhad at the turn of the century. We do not wish to seethem set aside. So we appeal to all our fellow Membersto make sure they are not forgotten. We urge everyoneto use the mechanisms we have here to that end.Whenever there are grave threats to internationalpeace  we are confident that the members of theSecurity Council will guide us well. We acknowledgethe vital role they have in ensuring that internationalprinciples are upheld by every Member. In this  theyhave our full support  and we will contribute to theirwork in whatever way we can.But the Council is still only one part of the workof the United Nations. There are many other tasks:above all  the peaceful work that binds all our layers ofcooperation together.We do not wish to see the Organization'sattention directed solely towards the dark side ofinternational life. Building a secure framework forinternational cooperation involves a long  consistentand comprehensive process. Like any process  it has tobe constantly refined. We accept this. We do not feel however  that the events of the past year mean that it hasto be abandoned and redesigned. In saying this  I believewe share the deepest hopes of all developing nations."
"27",1084,"BTN",57,2002,"﻿We have before us anarray of issues that are as compelling and daunting asever before. Many of these threaten to widen furtherthe divides that separate us and deepen more thewounds that pain us. They challenge ever so severelyour resolve to live in peace and harmony. But weremain hopeful. Under the President's leadership andguidance  we are confident that our deliberations willbe purposeful and productive. Toward this  I assure thePresident of the full cooperation of my delegation.I take this opportunity to express our gratitude toHis Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo for his stewardshipand contribution to the work of the fifty-sixth session.His presidency  at a most challenging time in thehistory of the United Nations  has enhanced the esteemof the international community for him and theRepublic of Korea.My delegation takes great pleasure in welcomingthe Swiss Confederation and the Democratic Republicof Timor-Leste as they take their rightful place in ourfamily of nations. While we welcome the admission ofTimor-Leste as a newly independent State  it is with asense of deep satisfaction that we appreciate thedecision of the Swiss people. It is an affirmation oftheir faith in the relevance and indispensability of theUnited Nations. They  more than any other people have observed and studied with active participation theworkings of this world body. As a country for whichthe United Nations will always be critically important Bhutan is indeed deeply heartened.The loss of lives and untold suffering anddestruction wrought by the senseless acts of 11September have united all of humanity against the evilof terrorism in all its manifestations. No clearorientation towards international peace anddevelopment is possible without uprooting this diseasethat has been allowed to afflict many of our societies.The United Nations must continue to play acentral and decisive role in directing our collectiveresolve and efforts to eradicate terrorism. While in ourown countries we must each take all possible measuresto rid ourselves of this menace  we know that it isthrough the multilateral framework that our national regional and global efforts can be effectively andrightly coordinated. It is imperative that in our battleagainst terrorism  the norms and principles of thishallowed institution are not undermined. Our war onterrorism must continue to unite us.The realization of a new economic order that isinclusive  equitable and sustainable remains the mostpressing challenge of the United Nations. The scourgeof poverty and disease continue to afflict millions ofpeople around the world. My delegation is compelledto reiterate its concern over the decline in officialdevelopment assistance (ODA) and the parallelemphasis on market efficiency and trade as an engineof growth.We realize that trade underpins equal partnershipand should represent the ultimate goal of economicdevelopment strategies. However  not all countries12have the necessary capacity to take advantage of theglobal trading system. Without timely and adequateassistance to fill the resource gap to meet their basicdevelopment priorities  many of the developingcountries will continue to suffer from marginalization.Clearly  there is a need to create a fair andequitable trading environment without prejudice to theflow of adequate Official Development Assistance. Inparticular  the special needs and vulnerabilities of leastdeveloped countries  landlocked developing countriesand small island developing states must becomprehensively addressed to enable them toeffectively integrate into the global economic system.In Africa  the international community must lend itsfull support to extricate the continent from the malaiseof underdevelopment and to prevent its furthermarginalization. In this context  Bhutan welcomes theendorsement of the New Economic Partnership forAfrica's Development by the high-level plenarymeeting of the General Assembly and hopes that theinternational community will provide the necessarysupport to this programme. This is particularlysignificant for those countries emerging from conflict in which the rehabilitation of social and economicinfrastructure is vital if peace is to be sustained.There is no lack of vision and strategies toovercome the socio-economic maladies that confrontthe global community. The Millennium DeclarationGoals provide clear targets and strategies to reducepoverty  achieve sustainable development and reversethe devastating trend of HIV/AIDS  malaria andtuberculosis. What we need is greater political will.I wish to acknowledge the contributions of theUnited Nations and bilateral donors to the developmentof my country. We are grateful to our partners not onlyfor the substantial amount of assistance we havereceived over the years  but for the acceptance of ourinsistence on being the master of our own destiny. Ourpartnership is characterized by a frank and openpolitical dialogue of high intensity  while thecooperative arrangements at all levels are marked by anotable degree of transparency.My country continues to be guided by our goal ofpromoting gross national happiness' as opposed tosimply targeting the enhancement of our gross nationalproduct as the end of development. We believe that it isthe responsibility of the Government to create anenabling environment within which every citizenwould have a reasonable opportunity to find happiness.Towards this end  all our development strategies mustsubscribe to strengthening of the four pillars of grossnational happiness  which are: first  the ensuring ofequitable and sustainable socio-economic development;secondly  conservation of our fragile mountainecology; thirdly  promotion of basic human values andculture; and fourthly  the strengthening of goodgovernance.It is my belief that those are the pillars on whichthe happiness of our human society can be firmlyestablished. While I am fully aware that Bhutan iscertainly not unique in its pursuit of happiness  Iexpress the hope that more among us will join in thatsearch with a greater sense of seriousness."
"28",1126,"BWA",57,2002,"﻿Let me begin by stating thatour thoughts and prayers are with the people of theUnited States as they commemorate the firstanniversary of the 11 September 2001 terror attacks inNew York and Washington. The events of that daycompel us to unite and adopt effective measures toeradicate the scourge of terrorism.I take this opportunity to reaffirm Botswana'sstrong support for the work of the Security CouncilCounter-Terrorism Committee established to monitorthe effective implementation of Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001). The international communitymust maintain its unity and remain vigilant so as toensure that such acts of terror never happen again.It is my pleasure to extend to you  Sir  and toyour country  Chad  the warm congratulations ofBotswana on your election to a vice-presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session  and towish you every success. I assure you of the fullcooperation of my delegation.If we had started this meeting on time  I wouldnot have minded at all. I have greater respect for timethan for hordes of latecomers. I am also grateful for thefact that after other heads of State or Government leftNew York  nobody removed the chairs in the AssemblyHall.I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Han Seung-Soo of theRepublic of Korea  President of the General Assemblyat the fifty-seventh session  for the skilful manner inwhich he conducted the work of that session.Let me also place on record that we appreciatethe good work which our Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  is doing to reform the United Nations funds andprogrammes. The reform process is contributing to thestrengthening of the capacity of those specialinstitutions to deliver assistance to Member States in amore coherent and efficient manner.I join others in congratulating and welcominginto the United Nations family Switzerland  a newMember State  and East Timor  which is soon tobecome one.2I am delighted that Switzerland has now taken itsrightful place in this world body. The United Nationshas indeed been strengthened  and its universalcharacter has undoubtedly been enhanced.In East Timor the United Nations demonstratedits commitment to the principles and purposes of theCharter by playing a pivotal and decisive role inensuring that the people of East Timor can  at longlast  exercise their right to national self-determination.We live in a world of diverse cultures andtraditions  yet we are united by our common humanity.There is no alternative to coming together to addressthe many dangers that threaten humanity. No onecountry can hope to successfully confront  on its own those global challenges  whether underdevelopment poverty  insecurity or threats to peace. They arechallenges that require global solutions and theparticipation of all global stakeholders to confrontthem. It is for those reasons that the United Nationsremains an important unifying institution for all ofhumanity. It is the only institution that can play theimportant role of fostering partnership  cooperation andmultilateralism.States  especially those  like ours  that oursmall  have high expectations of what multilateralcooperation can do for them  and how it can change forthe better the lives and destiny of the peoples of theUnited Nations.In this regard  we cannot fail to speak about thevaried and complex challenges developing countriescontinue to face  particularly in the continent of Africa.Despite consistent efforts in the past to assist Africa there are still widening disparities in developmentbetween the continent and the rest of the world. Africacontinues to experience high levels of poverty  which isaggravated by  among other things  the unfavourableglobal economic environment and conflicts. Thesechallenges are further compounded by the HIV/AIDSpandemic.Let me hasten to state that to acknowledge theexistence of problems does not mean that the future isentirely bleak. There are positive developments thatgive reason for hope for the realization of theaspirations of our people. Africa has committed itselfto creating an environment conducive to economicgrowth and development. We have taken concrete stepsto ensure that Africa is united and better prepared toface up to its problems.We have taken the first step in a broad andcomprehensive process to bring our countries togetherthrough the establishment of the African Union. TheNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) which was considered by this Assembly this week  isone of the major initiatives of the African Union.Botswana is convinced that NEPAD provides a soundbasis for building real partnerships within thecontinent  as well as with the rest of the internationalcommunity.It is important to reiterate Africa's deepappreciation of the support and assistance that we havereceived and continue to receive from the internationalcommunity. We particularly welcome the resolutionthat has just been adopted by the General Assemblymandating the United Nations funds and programmesto support the implementation of NEPAD. Botswana isalso happy with the decision of the G8 countries to joinhands with us to ensure the success of this initiative.We stand ready to make our contribution so that thenoble objectives of NEPAD can be attained.Central to the achievement of Africa'sdevelopment objectives is a commitment by theinternational community to implement the decisions ofthe United Nations world conferences. We need towork assiduously to implement the MonterreyConsensus  which identifies sources that can be used tofinance the development goals that we have set forourselves. Potential sources include the mobilization ofdomestic resources; the mobilization of externalresources  including foreign direct investment;increased financial and technical cooperation; and theresolution of the debt crisis. The Monterrey Consensusalso recognizes trade as an engine of growth anddevelopment. The international community thereforehas a responsibility to ensure that developing countriescan participate in world trade. In this regard  we viewpartnership agreements  such as the CotonouAgreement and the African Growth and OpportunityAct  as important steps towards fulfilling some of theobjectives of the Monterrey Consensus.HIV/AIDS remains  undoubtedly  the mostserious threat to the economic and social progress ofthe world. Its devastating impact on the Africancontinent is well documented. There is no doubt that noone country has the capacity to deal with the problemsassociated with this epidemic on its own. If we are toconquer it  we will need a strategy that combinesefforts on a broad front. Those who think that they are3still free from the epidemic and that it is an Africanproblem had better wake up  because next time it willbe on their own doorstep.Botswana is immensely grateful for the support ithas received from the United Nations and othercooperating partners in its efforts to fight the epidemic.I also wish to commend the Secretary-General for histireless efforts in mobilizing the internationalcommunity to support our efforts. I am sure that  withthe help of the international community  we in Africawill still be standing when the dust settles.Botswana is pleased to note the commendableefforts that the United Nations continues to make in themaintenance of peace and security in various parts ofthe world. With the continued assistance of the UnitedNations and the rest of the international community  wehave reason to be optimistic and hope that thecontinent of Africa will soon find peace.We have closely followed the Organization'sinitiative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo particularly in the areas of the disarmament demobilization  repatriation  resettlement andreintegration of the former combatants into civilsociety. We welcome the ongoing consultationsbetween the various parties to the conflict. We areanxious  however  to see full-fledged negotiations thatcan lead to a lasting political settlement. The people ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo yearn for peaceand national reconciliation  as well as the social andeconomic development of their country.We therefore call upon all parties to demonstrategreater determination and a sense of urgency in thesearch for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in thatcountry. Peace in the Democratic Republic of theCongo is possible and necessary  but in the finalanalysis  it depends on the political will of thesignatories to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement.I wish to salute the efforts and indomitable spiritof my immediate predecessor  Sir Ketumile Masire. Hehas been tireless and unwavering in his mission offacilitating the inter-Congolese dialogue  convincingthe people of that country that peace can come only ifthey are willing to talk to each other. Nobody willcome from heaven or hell to create peace for them. Ialso wish to place on record Botswana's appreciationof the efforts and determination of President Mbeki ofSouth Africa. He has invested substantial time  energyand resources to find solutions to the conflict in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.Botswana welcomes and commends the historicstep taken by the Government of Angola and UNITA insigning the Memorandum of Understanding of 4 April2002 as an addendum to the Lusaka Protocol. Thepeople of Angola have opted for peace. They expectthe international community to help them consolidatethis peace. Let us not fail them. I ask the ambassadorsand foreign ministers who happen to be present here totake the message to my fellow heads of State in Africathat we should not let down the people of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and  above all  thepeople of Angola. They have suffered enough.Conflicts and instability in other parts of theworld  such as the Middle East and Afghanistan  are ofserious concern to us. We look to the internationalcommunity  within the framework of the UnitedNations  to play a greater role in the peacefulresolution of those conflicts.Let me conclude by reiterating Botswana'scontinued support for the United Nations and expressmy delegation's appreciation to the Secretary-General whose visionary leadership has continued to guide ourOrganization."
"29",1168,"CAF",57,2002,"﻿The fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly is being held one year after the terribleterrorist attack of 11 September 2001. The delegationof the Central African Republic still intimately feelsthe strong emotion caused by that attack against libertyand democracy.The President of the Republic  the head of State His Excellency Ange-Félix Patassé  leading thedelegation of the Central African Republic to thecommemoration  wanted to reiterate his friendlysympathy towards the American Government andpeople  and to reassert the firm determination of hiscountry to do everything that is necessary in order tocontribute effectively to the legitimate internationalcrusade against all forms of terrorism. Our work isstarting within a particular context in the history ofinternational relations  because never has humanitybeen so conscious of the need to confirm its cohesionin order to ensure a world of concord  solidarity andpeace.Before expanding on those facts  Mr. President  Iwould like to express to Mr. Jan Kavan and themembers of the Bureau our warm congratulations onhis election to the presidency of this session. His richexperience  as a great statesman and diplomat  willensure the success of our work. That work will benefitfrom the full cooperation of the delegation of theCentral African Republic. I take this opportunity alsoto express our admiration for his eminent predecessor Mr. Han Seung-soo  for the skill and competence withwhich he carried out his responsibilities.The determination with which the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kofi Annan  isworking  under all circumstances  to make theprinciples and ideals of the United Nations prevail once more elicits our admiration. The President of theRepublic  the people and the Government of theCentral African Republic  want hereby to assure you oftheir support and reiterate their deep gratitude for allthe objective reports on the situation in the CentralAfrican Republic.Moreover  the entry of the Swiss Confederation tothe United Nations  and soon the entry of theDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste  are evidence ofthe resolute march of our Organization towardsuniversality. The Central African Republic wishes towelcome Switzerland and hopes to cooperate closely21with that country within the framework of the UnitedNations.Two years ago  189 Member States met in thisvery hall. They set objectives for development for theMillennium  such as the reduction of extreme poverty education for all  promotion of gender equality and theempowerment of women  reduction of child mortality improvement of maternal health  fight againstHIV/AIDS and other diseases  such as malaria andtuberculosis  preservation of a sustainable environmentand the establishment of a world partnership fordevelopment. All States unanimously pledged  throughmultilateral cooperation  to implement what is calledthe Millennium Declaration in order to achieve thoseobjectives within 15 years.The findings we made at the Millennium Summiton the state of the world at that time showed seriousshortcomings with regard to our will to fulfilcollectively the ideals bequeathed to us by the foundingfathers of our Organization. However  through thatsame will  we undertook  in the MillenniumDeclaration  to re-examine these issues so as to set acourse for the world that corresponds to the aspirationsand expectations of the people.However  this is far from what has happened. Therevolution in information and communications  theprogress of science and technology  the liberalizationof trade and the disappearance of State frontiers  whileaccentuating the phenomenon of globalization  have atthe same time led the world into an uncertain andunforeseeable future  to the point where the worldtoday is threatened in the short term with imbalance.States should fully explore all the potentialoffered by multilateral cooperation within theframework of the United Nations  particularly to put astop to such threats. These threats  according to ourdelegation  are essentially of four kinds.The first of these  as you can expect  is the threatthat changed the world in one hour. It is calledterrorism. This diffuse form of organized trans-bordercrime that foils armies  however powerful they may be cannot be tolerated. The reaction of the internationalcommunity to this new form of aggression must besustained by adhering to resolutions firmly condemningsuch actions  and by observing a certain attitudetowards the countries and institutions that tolerate theirauthors. Thus  all together  through solidarity andmultilateral cooperation  we shall conquer terrorism whether committed by a State or a small group.The destruction of the environment  whichthreatens our future  is also a real threat. We shouldstrive for the sustainable preservation of forests  faunaand biodiversity for the benefit of present and futuregenerations. This subject was eloquently analysed atthe Summit on Sustainable Development  held recentlyin Johannesburg. My delegation has no doubt thatinternational solidarity can here too be of help tosafeguard nature. We should like on this occasion toexpress our gratitude for the American initiative supported by the international community  for theprotection of the Congo basin  of which the CentralAfrican Republic is a member.There is one threat  which does not need to benamed because it is so obvious  and that is poverty which — far from declining — has grown over theyears. The Declaration talks about reducing poverty but must we not first stop manufacturing it? Famine endemic disease  HIV/AIDS and malaria are the dailylot of the two thirds of humankind living on barely $1 aday. How can we fail to be moved by this? That fringeof humanity calls merely for the solidarity that willallow it to live in conditions worthy of our civilization.In the face of the drying up of officialdevelopment assistance  and with respect to the failureof certain development initiatives  the Africancountries have felt that we need to develop some sortof partnership with the countries of the North. Theyhave therefore proposed an original plan for thedevelopment of Africa through the New Partnership forAfrica's Development. The delegation of the CentralAfrican Republic fervently calls for the worldwidesupport of the international community for theimplementation of the plan.The many challenges defined at the MillenniumSummit in terms of goals to be attained  along with thenew plan for African development  will have no chanceof success unless they are fostered in an environmentof peace  security and stability. However  currentconditions do not give much cause for optimism although we note the occasional positive movementtowards the settlement of a few conflicts. Regionalcrises remain  however  that are no less threatening topeace.Faithful to its doctrine  the Central AfricanRepublic believes that the situation in the Middle East22can be settled only through the strict implementation ofthe relevant resolutions of the United Nations on thissubject. It deplores the escalation of violence in thatregion.In the context of its own regional and subregionalsphere  the Central African Republic highly appreciatesthe latest developments in the situation in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  in particular thesigning of the Pretoria peace agreement with Rwandaand the disengagement agreement signed with Uganda.In conclusion  I am compelled to note that mycountry  the Central African Republic  is the victim ofinternational ostracism and of indifference that borderson contempt. How else is one to understand the silenceof the international community and the internationalfinancial institutions in the face of calls forintervention and of Security Council resolutionsfollowing on the reports of the Secretary-General sincethe notorious date of 20 May 2000  and despite theappeals of the Organization of African Unity — nowthe African Union — the Community of Sahel-SaharanStates and the Central African Economic and MonetaryCommunity? And yet  our country has come a verylong way with respect to good governance — thatfetishistic word! — in politics  economics and finance.As of early 2002  the reduction of corruption is nolonger a figment of the imagination  as evinced by theaction undertaken in our financial offices.My country's situation requires me to callattention to the words of the Algerian writer KatebYassin:“Our blood must become enflamed and we mustcatch fire in order to move the spectators. Maythe world open its eyes not to our mortal remains but to the wounds of the survivors.”The sustainable development we all dream of willbecome a reality only if  here and now  we injectsolidarity into international relations."
"30",1215,"CAN",57,2002,"﻿I would like  throughyou  Sir  to congratulate Jan Kavan on his election asPresident of the General Assembly and to assure him ofour delegation's cooperation as he undertakes hisimportant responsibilities this year.Yesterday  people the world over paused toremember the victims of the tragic events of one yearago. I had the opportunity of attending the interfaithservice yesterday  where the President of the GeneralAssembly and the Secretary-General spoke movinglyabout how the commemoration of that event mustreinforce this institution's vocation as the forumdedicated to world peace.Canadians entirely subscribe to the sentimentsthat were there expressed. The attacks of lastSeptember were a cruel and devastating blow to theUnited States and  indeed  to us all. I am proud to saythat Canadians stood in solidarity with our closest allyat that terrible moment. When the terrorists struck thatday  they were also attacking the very principles ofinternational law  security and humanitarianism that areembodied in the United Nations Charter. We believethat our ultimate response to the challenges of 11September is thus to rededicate ourselves to our beliefsand to the principles upon which the United Nationswas founded.(spoke in French)Now  more than ever  the main challenge for eachof our countries and for the United Nations is tomanage our interdependence. Environmentaldegradation and endemic poverty  the proliferation ofdisease and epidemics  the increasing threat ofterrorism and organized crime  these are serious complex issues that no one nation can confront alone.To succeed  our countries must work together  whilealso drawing on the expertise of civil society. Suchinteraction is a formidable challenge and one that theUnited Nations is best suited to meet.Recognition of our interdependence in no waythreatens our respective sovereignty. In fact  it giveseach of us even more tangible means to act and tosucceed through the sharing of our information resources and initiatives.The principles of multilateralism are articulatedwith vigour and resolve in the Millennium Declaration which assigns a decisive role to the United NationsCharter  and rightly so  for it is much more than ourconstitution. Indeed  it is our heart and soul. Itreconciles national interests with the highest moral andethical standards that must govern the actions of eachState. For us  the Charter is the key to unlock the doorto the world of peace  security and justice that we hopeto build.The terrorist threat leads us to work together and tragically  illustrates the extent of our interdependence.It demonstrates the urgency of finding solutions thatare equal to the task at hand and whose effectivenesshinges on new partnerships among our countries. Ourreaction to terrorism must be steadfast  to be sure  andwe must make no concession to the agents of terror  butif we want our reaction to be truly effective  it mustenhance both national security and respect for basicrights. In fact  democratic governance and security findtheir most solid foundation in societies in which rightsand freedoms are respected and where  as a result dissidence more often than not takes constructive rather than violent forms.What is more  the fight against terrorismchallenges us to find ways to open our hearts andminds to the diversity of our world  its cultures and itsreligions. Now more than ever  we must promotedialogue  understanding and tolerance with respect toother people. In this way  we will help to eradicate atits source much of the pain that all too often translates26into rising hatred  extremism and fanaticism of allsorts.Multilateralism has definitely proven its worthover the past year. For example  dozens of countrieshave offered their resources and experience toAfghanistan as members of the coalition againstterrorism or of the Afghanistan Support Group. Theyhave also contributed to the various United Nationsprogrammes seeking to establish political stability andrepresentative Government.The G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread ofWeapons and Materials of Mass Destruction  concludedat Kananaskis in June  is another concrete example ofour joint commitment to battling terrorism and otherthreats to peace. Canada  as Chair of the G8  was astrong advocate of this major effort designed tostrengthen international security and strategic stability.Canada will continue to work to make this initiative asuccess.At all times  Canada is ready to offer its supportwherever it is needed and we encourage theinternational community to continue to do likewise. Wealso believe that the multilateral approach is useful inaddressing the obvious challenges posed by sustainabledevelopment. In this regard  the consensus thatemerged from the Monterrey Conference calls on allcountries to work together to forge broaderpartnerships between developed and developingcountries.In this regard  the situation in Africa cries out foraction. For too long now  inaction has taken a heavytoll in terms of human suffering. However  hope isbeginning to shine through. The New Partnership forAfrica's Development  devised by African leadersdetermined to meet the challenges of self-developmentand endorsed at Canada's urging-during the G8 summitin Kananaskis  seeks to provide the people of Africawith conditions founded on good governance anddemocracy  while ending their marginalization andoffering them the chance to achieve prosperity.As we meet here today  the Israeli-Palestiniancrisis remains at its all too familiar impasse  despite thefact that everyone knows what is needed to restorepeace. We all know that the targeting of civilians muststop  that the security of Israel must be assured  thatsettlement-building must end  that the humanitarianneeds of the Palestinian people must be met  that thePalestinian Authority must reform itself democraticallyand that the peace negotiations must resume. We allknow  in sum  that a road to a peaceful future must bebuilt  a future in which two independent  viable  secureand democratic States  Israel and Palestine  live side byside in peace and security.Canada calls on the Palestinian Authority and theGovernment of Israel to start back on the road to peace.The people and the Government of Canada willaccompany them and support them every step of theway.We also meet here today in an atmosphere ofdeepening tension caused by Iraq's continued floutingof the will of the international community and by thediffering opinions that prevail around us on how toaddress this situation and bring the crisis to a close. Letthere be no doubt: at the origin of today's tensions isthe persistent refusal of the Iraqi Government tocomply with its obligations to us all under SecurityCouncil resolutions. For the past seven years  Iraq hasrefused to demonstrate that it has abandoned itschemical  biological and nuclear weapons programmes and it remains even today unwilling to do so. But letthere also be no doubt that bringing Iraq intoconformity with its international obligations must bethe work of us all acting together.We believe that our ability to find a solution tothis challenge  one that is consistent with and  indeed that reinforces the international framework that wehave so painstakingly constructed since the lastdevastating World War  will define this generation andcreate precedents that may determine the futuredirection of the world. It is with this in mind thatCanada welcomes the powerful message delivered heretoday by President Bush affirming his country'scommitment to work with the Security Council inresolving this serious threat to our collective peace andsecurity.We therefore urge Iraq to seize this opportunitywithout delay  and to grant immediate andunconditional access to United Nations weaponsinspectors in compliance with its Security Councilobligations. The onus is clearly on the Government ofIraq to take this step now. The onus is equally on us toensure that our international institutions emerge fromthis crisis reinforced and strengthened.Such institutions may well be new  as in the caseof the International Criminal Court (ICC)  a body thathas the potential to ensure the integrity of our27international legal system  upon which so muchdepends for the peaceful resolution of our differences.This week I had the privilege of attending the inauguralmeeting of the Assembly of States Parties here in NewYork with many in this Hall and was encouraged by thedepth of international political and public support thatexists for this important new body.The people of the world want an end to impunity.They insist that their leaders no longer turn a blind eyeto gross violations of international humanitarian lawlike those we witnessed in the past century. Immunityfrom the law is simply no longer acceptable. The Statesparties to the ICC Statute are more than willing to putinto action the proposition that we can best enforcerules of law that we have arrived at by our commonaccord   those indeed that we are willing to haveinvoked against us as well. For the 79 States partiesthat attended the Assembly of States Parties and themany observer States close to ratifying the RomeStatute  our objective remains to work resolutely andcooperatively to make the Court a reality.The International Criminal Court represents amajor change in the way the world works. The timeswe live in demand many such innovative approaches.For example  in response to a call from the Secretary-General  Canada  along with others  launched theindependent International Commission on Interventionand State Sovereignty. Its landmark report  entitled`The Responsibility to Protect'  has shifted theparameters of the debate from divisions overintervention toward agreement on the responsibility ofa State to protect its people. The report holds thatsovereignty entails responsibilities as well as rights:that sovereignty is responsibility. When States areunable or unwilling to afford protection to their ownpeople  the international community has aresponsibility to step in temporarily and to provide thatprotection. The report represents  in our view  anopportunity for us to reinforce the United Nations in itscollective security mission. It also provides anoccasion to affirm the fundamental norm-building roleof the United Nations and to find better ways toprevent and  where necessary  alleviate humansuffering.Part of our shared responsibility to raise thecredibility of multilateral institutions is to address theirshortcomings  including those of the United Nationsitself. We are greatly encouraged that the Secretary-General and his Deputy  Louise FrÈchette  areproposing far-reaching organizational reforms. Theycan count on Canada's support. We also support reformin other areas  notably in respect to the nearlymoribund Disarmament Commission and its glacialprogress on issues of non-proliferation  arms controland disarmament  where recent gains such as theUnited Nations Programme of Action on small armsand light weapons and the negotiations on aninternational code of conduct on missiles are beingovershadowed by a myriad of compliance problems.Certainly  there are problems with multilateralismand the institutions we have created  but that shouldnot cause us to doubt the desirability of an effectiverules-based system. Our objective should be to addressthese shortcomings where we see them and reformwhat we must  and in the process answer the criticismsof those suspicious of an interdependent world. We willpersuade the sceptics only by building betterinstitutions to implement the international rule of lawand globally arrived-at solutions to our commonproblems.Let us therefore embrace cooperation  notdivision. Let us expand our sovereignty by pooling it.Let us be partners in the larger enterprise of buildingpeace and freedom. No one country can meet all thechallenges of our times on its own. Let us haveconfidence in our common humanity. Let us make theUnited Nations our principal instrument of peace. Ipledge to the Assembly today that Canada will spare noeffort in so doing."
"31",1230,"CHE",57,2002,"﻿It isimperative  now more than ever before  that all thepeoples of the world act in a spirit of solidarity. TheUnited Nations embodies this spirit. In joining theUnited Nations  Switzerland sends you a message ofsolidarity. This makes me proud and happy.I would like to add my thanks to those expressedlast Tuesday by Kaspar Villiger  the President of theSwiss Confederation  on the occasion of Switzerland'sformal admission to the United Nations. I would alsolike to thank all the Members of the United Nations forthe warm welcome they have given my country.Switzerland feels welcomed. We feel that we are wherewe belong.I would also like to give Secretary-General KofiAnnan my profound thanks. His sincerity and wisdomcontributed greatly to convincing the people ofSwitzerland of the need to join the United Nations.I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection. I already know and value your qualities andtalents and I know that you will put them to the bestservice of the United Nations. Switzerland is pleased tobe working with you towards the success of thissession of the General Assembly.The Swiss people have decided to join the UnitedNations. They have said yes' to increased cooperationwith the United Nations. They have said yes' to astronger international commitment. They have saidyes' to taking greater responsibility for meeting thechallenges that face humankind.The challenges facing the internationalcommunity at the beginning of the twenty-first centuryare immense. A number of regions suffer from terriblepoverty. Crises and wars are rife on all continents.There are millions of refugees. We see the hideous faceof terrorism. Criminal networks exploit human beingsand traffic shamefully in drugs and arms. New diseasesare emerging and  day after day  we continue to destroythe Earth's ecological balance.There are no simple answers to any of theseproblems  but there is a place where we can all meet tofind solutions: the United Nations. The world needs astrong United Nations  as it is the only universalOrganization working at the global level. It alone cananalyse problems at the world level. It alone can createa consensus between States on common goals. Finally as stressed by the Secretary-General  there is nosubstitute for the unique international legitimacyprovided to principles and choices of action by theUnited Nations.Switzerland has joined the United Nations as aneutral country and we intend to remain neutral. Ourneutral status  however  in no way diminishes ourdesire for cooperation. On the contrary  it is anadvantage for our peace activities. Our membership ofthe United Nations is not a change in direction  but thelogical consequence of our foreign policy.To quote our Constitution  the SwissConfederation is committed Ö to a just and peacefulinternational order'. The principal aim of the UnitedNations is to maintain international peace and security.For us  therefore  the United Nations is the ideal placeto carry out this vital mission. As a Member of theUnited Nations  Switzerland will devote itselfresolutely to international peace and security. Thatcommitment will be focused  above all  on armed27conflicts. The logic of armed conflicts today forces usto adopt a multidimensional approach to peaceprocesses. If we are to succeed  we must work inseveral different areas in parallel: military  diplomatic humanitarian and economic. We must also involve allinterested players in the process. All this demands amajor effort of coordination  and Switzerland willcontribute to that.Security problems  moreover  must be addressedfrom a broader angle  that of human security. Theinhabitants of this world must be able to live withoutfear of war  starvation and despotism. In particular  wemust protect vulnerable individuals and groups.Switzerland will therefore pursue its efforts in favourof human security. This includes stopping therecruitment of child soldiers  eliminating anti-personnel mines and halting the proliferation of smallarms.In this context  I welcome the Secretary-General's appeal to make full use of multilateralinstitutions. This is especially valid for themaintenance of international peace and security. Thereis only one source of legitimacy for the use of force:the United Nations.Iraq has been discussed on several occasionsduring these past days. There is undeniably a need toact  and to act with determination  in order to ensurethe implementation of United Nations resolutions  butaction must be taken together  within the UnitedNations. Only the United Nations can conferinternational legitimacy to any action against Iraq.Switzerland is convinced that peace anddevelopment can be sustained only if they go hand inhand with freedom  democracy  and respect for humanrights. Human dignity is our most precious asset. Itmust be defended at all times and in all places. We willchampion this conviction at the United Nations to thefull and without concessions. For as long as men andwomen are exploited  children are mistreated and thedeath penalty is carried out  Switzerland will doeverything within its power to defend human dignity.At the General Assembly this year  we will strivein particular to promote the adoption of the draftoptional protocol to the United Nations Conventionagainst Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or DegradingTreatment or Punishment. This protocol is needed togive better protection to people in detention againsttorture and mistreatment. That is why we have beensupporting this initiative for years.In its capacity as the Depositary State Switzerland feels a special responsibility to promoteawareness of and respect for the Geneva Conventionsand their Additional Protocols. At the United Nations we will continue tirelessly to defend these instruments.In this area  Switzerland has submitted to a number ofcountries involved in the Middle East conflict aproposal which aims to ensure the betterimplementation of international humanitarian law. Weadvocate two mechanisms: one for promoting dialogueto allow the parties to settle problems concerning theapplication of international humanitarian law; thesecond  a mechanism to monitor respect forhumanitarian law.We are also convinced that the InternationalCriminal Court will ensure the better application ofinternational humanitarian law. This new Court is anessential tool for dealing with serious violations of thefundamental human freedoms. We will thereforeremain on our guard to ensure that it can functionefficiently and we will pursue our efforts to convincethose States that have not yet signed the Rome Statuteof the need for such a Court.Two days ago  we commemorated the tragicevents that shook the United States and the world oneyear ago. The causes of terrorism must be eradicated. Iam thinking  inter alia  of injustice  disregard for therights of minorities  and poverty. That is one of theobjectives of our development cooperation and of ourhuman rights policy.Sustainable development and the elimination ofpoverty remain mankind's main challenges today. Wesaw that again at Johannesburg. They are globalchallenges that require a global strategy and globalsolidarity. In other words  they require coordinatedaction by the United Nations institutions  as well asgreater cooperation between the United Nations  thedevelopment banks  civil society and the private sector.Development cooperation must be coordinated.Switzerland will contribute to strengthening thecoordination efforts vital to ensuring that our activitiesenjoy the success they merit.The struggle against poverty also requires greaterexchange of expertise and better transfer of technology.Switzerland is closely involved in the preparation ofthe World Summit on the Information Society  the first28phase of which will take place in Geneva in 2003. Themain challenge of that Summit is the very gap betweenNorth and South in terms of access to new informationtechnologies. Therefore  I call on all to contributeactively to the success of that conference.These thoughts lead me to refer to Geneva  theinternational city that is a close and longstanding linkbetween my country and the United Nations.Switzerland is proud and grateful to be able to host theEuropean Headquarters of the United Nations andmany specialized agencies. Geneva is the maininternational hub of disarmament  humanitarian aid social development  the promotion of human rights andenvironmental protection. That gives me greatpleasure  because Swiss citizens are particularlyconcerned about these issues. However  that alsoinvolves the special responsibility of offeringinternational organizations optimum working andliving conditions. You can also count on Switzerland inthat area.Before Switzerland became a Member  the UnitedNations was already a universal Organization  but withSwitzerland  and soon Timor-Leste  the UnitedNations will be even more universal. The UnitedNations is the greatest world forum. Switzerland willprovide it its full support in the interests of humanityand the interests of we  the peoples of the UnitedNations."
"32",1276,"CHL",57,2002,"﻿On behalfof my country  I congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan and theother members of the Bureau on their election. ThePresident can count on the full cooperation of thedelegation of Chile for the success of his stewardship.The Government of Chile takes this opportunityto welcome the accession to membership of the UnitedNations of the Swiss Confederation and  soon  ofTimor-Leste. The presence of Switzerland strengthensits historical association with the founding principles ofthis Organization. The upcoming presence of Timor-Leste symbolizes the role of the United Nations in thecreation of a viable and democratic State. We are proudto have contributed to that mission.One year ago  this city suffered a reprehensibleterrorist attack that left an indelible stain on theconscience of mankind. That date  11 September 2001 marked a turning point in contemporary history. Thisepisode brought us face to face with new dimensions ofour human vulnerability  with a fragility thatuniversalized insecurity. The attack perpetrated a fewkilometres from this place showed us  with frightfulcruelty  that human coexistence urgently requires newapproaches and new instruments.It has become necessary for Governments andsocieties to forge positive responses and to worktogether to resolutely confront terrorism. In aglobalized world  it is imperative that we re-evaluatemultilateralism  and Chile would like to renew itscommitment in that regard.We believe that  at this period of history  we haveto make every effort to bring about a safer world. Thatchallenge should unite societies and cultures. As theSecretary-General pointed out yesterday  the UnitedNations alone has the legitimacy necessary tocontribute to an effective system of security.Complying with Security Council resolutions is aresponsibility incumbent upon everyone  and isessential to the future of the Organization.The changes that have taken place in recent yearshave created new challenges and responsibilities forthe world that we must assume  and to which we mustrespond  as a global society. The risks today are indeedboth global and without boundaries. Both States andordinary men and women in every part of the worldnow face a new environment of uncertainty. In thatcontext  traditional notions of security  which wereformulated against the backdrop of threats from Stateactors  have been overtaken. A safer world requiresthat we build consensus and that we develop newapproaches that both take into account the multi-dimensional nature of threats and place people at thecentre of their concerns.In such a security scenario it is urgent that wepromote a comprehensive focus at the global level todeal with new threats and to build a world free of fearand poverty. The concept of human security hasemerged from just that sort of change. We would likepeople to be at the centre of every multilateraldeliberation. That was the priority that Chile put forth adecade ago with its initiative to hold a summit onsocial development. It is that same concern that has ledto our participation in the Human Security Network  ofwhich Chile has been the coordinator this year.Human security is linked to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  public order and thesocial environment. Those elements should bepromoted through innovative and effective strategies.Chile's candidacy for a seat on the SecurityCouncil for the period 2003-2004  which has thesupport of the Group of Latin American and theCaribbean States  for which we once again express ourappreciation  seeks to strengthen the multilateralapproach to crises that threaten international peace andsecurity  as well as to place human security at thecentre of the concerns of that main body of the UnitedNations.Respect for human rights is a fundamentalrequirement in the search for a world that is free fromfear  more secure and full of hope. Human rights are asource of political and social legitimacy in thecontemporary international system and provideguidelines for its actions. As a member of the34Commission on Human Rights  our country willparticipate in initiatives to strengthen the fundamentaland unique role of that body. Similarly  democracy toois a universal value  one which is expressed mainlythrough free elections and change in governance.Strengthening democracy requires integrity transparency and good governance. That is the properway to create a democratic environment in which asociety can be better integrated  protected and imbuedwith meaning.My country constructively supports and promotesthe spread of the values of democracy and democraticthinking throughout the world. In our region democracy is a fundamental value. The adoption of theInter-American Democratic Charter represents a stepforward in the continuing effort to further refine andstrengthen democracy. In that vein  we welcome theestablishment of the Community of Democracies as aconcerted attempt to make universal the values inherentin democracy.The cultural dimension  as an expression of amodern vision  must be part of our efforts to build asafer world. Intercultural dialogue and respect fordiversity are fundamental elements of civilizedrelations between nations. We believe that interculturaldialogue should contribute to strengthening theuniversal values of human dignity.International terrorism is a negation of the valuesthat make possible civilized coexistence  in which theremust be room for the diversity of the world. Terrorismis the greatest risk facing the global community inbuilding a safer world. Political commitment istherefore needed to agree on effective efforts toeradicate terrorism within the framework ofinternational law. Intercultural dialogue is essential todevelop a global strategy to combat terrorism. TheUnited Nations plays an essential role as the leadingorganization in the fight against terrorism. The work ofthe Security Council and of its Counter-TerrorismCommittee  established pursuant to Council resolution1373 (2001)  and the development of a generalconvention on international terrorism are efforts thatwe support and to which we will continue tocontribute. A convention on terrorism has been adoptedat the regional level  and we will continue to intensifyour cooperation through the Inter-American Committeeon Terrorism and the Common Market of the South.The risks and threats to global security  which arebeyond the effective control of States  highlight thenature of globalization in our world today. Indeed  thecharacteristics of globalization can be seen in suchphenomena as the globalization of markets  theintensification of social relations and the broadening ofcultural exchanges and communications. At the sametime  however  risks have also become global and theimbalances resulting from the unequal distribution ofwealth have increased  thereby accentuating the trendtowards the marginalization and exclusion ofcommunities  countries and regions.We believe in the benefits of economic andpolitical globalization. But we also believe thatglobalization requires good governance and asystematic and shared effort by the internationalcommunity to establish the rules of the newinternational system. We believe that there should begreater participation in this effort  as well as ongoingconsultations with our citizens and our civil societies.The United Nation system is an indispensable forumfor addressing these challenges.Just as we believe that the process ofglobalization in which we are now engaged requiresclear rules in order for its benefits to reach all ofmankind  we also believe that the economic growth andprosperity of countries require freedom  democracy andsecurity in this global world. Chile had adopted amodel that assigns to the market and to the privatesector a key role in its development plans  within aframework of democracy and solidarity. We areconvinced that active participation in internationaltrade is a positive way of achieving growth  increasingemployment  being innovative in the area oftechnology and being effective in the allocation ofresources.Based on our commitment to development withequity  we have opened up our economy  ourcommunications and our culture; and we are satisfiedat having done so. We believe  based on ourexperience  that globalization can be a source ofopportunity for all nations  particularly for small andremote countries such as ours  which are far from themajor consumer centres and international flows.In order for the efforts of nations such as ours tobe rewarded  however  it is essential for internationaltrade to be fair  to have clear-cut  established rules  andto avoid measures that distort it. Subsidies and lax35implementation of anti-dumping measures areobstacles to the achievement of that goal. In thisconnection  I wish to place special emphasis on theurgent need for the liberalization of the trade inagricultural products. Many developing countries including my own  are highly competitive in thissector  but the benefits are lost because ofprotectionism in the developed countries.We argued forcefully in Doha and Monterrey thatin order for there to be growth  there must be access tomarkets. As President Ricardo Lagos stated inMonterrey  If trade barriers were eliminated  thedeveloping countries would have the potential to earn$130 billion  more than twice the $50 billion that weproposed as a target for the Millennium Summit'.We urge the United Nations to continue its effortsto promote the integrated activities of the variousmultilateral political  economic and financial agenciesthat are helping to achieve a world of greaterdevelopment  equity and security.As the multilateral system continues to developculturally  socially and politically  Chile will continueto promote the mainstreaming of the genderperspective into the various activities of theinternational system and its subsystems. We alsosupport the creation of opportunities for participationby civil society organizations.The more developed  more equitable and saferworld to which we aspire also requires us to establishinternational standards for the protection of the rightsof vulnerable groups. Chile will continue to encouragethe conclusion of agreements that contribute to theformulation and improvement of public policies in thisfield. I would like to underscore our politicalcommitment to achieving a comprehensive conventionthat protects and promotes the rights and dignity ofpeople with disabilities. Integration  recognition of thedignity of people and equality of opportunity for all arethe basic precepts of a more secure society.We are convinced that we need to commitourselves as an international community to more activepolicies for the protection of the environment. Fewissues on the international agenda affect us all equallyas much as this one and  paradoxically  few generate asmany disputes. The Johannesburg Summit confirmedmy belief that we must work towards consensus onbasic concepts.The right to live in a socially acceptableenvironment is an ethical imperative of the present day.We must therefore give priority to a globalenvironmental agenda that focuses on improving legalnorms relating to  and providing better protection for the oceans  the climate  the atmosphere and the ozonelayer.Given the direct impact that this issue has ondevelopment  I wish to note that  in December 2003  atConcepciÛn  Chile  the World Biotechnology Forumwill take place under the sponsorship of the UnitedNations Industrial Development Organization and theGovernment of Chile.With regard to the political dimension  whichemphasizes security  human rights  democracy and thefight against terrorism  I would like to refer to certainareas of the world that are of greatest concern to theinternational community. Latin America is a region inwhich democracy is the norm  even though in somecases it is fragile. The nations of our continent havelearned how difficult it is to build and sustaindemocratic institutions based on universal principlesand values. We have a number of regional andsubregional mechanisms that compel us to fulfil thisobligation. The Rio Group is without doubt the mostimportant of these.The world is aware of the current economic crisisin our region. This is a paradoxical situation. LatinAmerica responded properly to the challenge andadopted many of the structural economic reforms thatwere asked of it  which led to a degree of liberalizationwithout precedent in its history. The developed world however  is sending contradictory signals that test thefaith of those of us who view globalization and thesystem of free trade as the basis for the development ofour peoples. Those of us who believe that globalizationmust be based on the principles of competitivenesswithout exclusion thus see  on a regular basis restrictions placed on our products; these are verydifficult to explain. This casts doubt on the existence ofa desire to move towards a globalization withoutcompartmentalization.Because of its gravity  I must refer to a conflictthat affects the entire international community. Chilewishes to express its deep concern at the gravesituation in the Middle East in the light of the impassein the peace negotiations aimed at finding a solution tothe crisis between Palestinians and Israelis. The36continuing escalation of the violence that began in theregion on 28 September 2000 continues to claim manyvictims and to cause heavy material damage  andthreatens to spread throughout the region  therebyposing a serious danger to international peace andsecurity.The Government of Chile reiterates the need forthe strict implementation of the relevant resolutions ofthe Security Council and recourse to constructivenegotiation  with a view to achieving a just comprehensive and lasting peace that make possiblethe creation of a viable Palestinian State andcoexistence with the State of Israel within secure andinternationally recognized borders. A world in whichPalestinians and Israelis can live together will be amore secure world.We share the international sense of urgency thatthe Government of Iraq must abide by the provisions ofSecurity Council resolutions in the interest of regionaland global security. We are convinced that in thisglobalized world it is essential for us to act inaccordance with the principles and values promoted bythe United Nations.In Africa we now see signs of hope. Chile wishesto express its firm support for the African continent inits decision to create modern regional instruments  suchas the African Union and the New Partnership forAfrica's Development. We hope that these initiatives to which Africans themselves have referred to as theAfrican renaissance  will generate in the internationalcommunity a response commensurate with thoseefforts. This is a new challenge for the twenty-firstcentury  and the United Nations must be involved.Chile  a small nation that looks out at the worldfrom the South  has developed important links ofinternational solidarity in the most diversedirections  in Latin America as part of the inter-American system; in its association with the EuropeanUnion; and as a member of the Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation organization. In opting for openmultilateralism  we are facing today's challenge ofworking towards a more secure world  a world freefrom fear and poverty. We will encounter obstacleswhich we must confront with shared political resolve.This is the responsibility of all the countriesrepresented here today in the General Assembly.Let us advance towards global human security.Let us combat terrorism  poverty and misery in thesearch for a more democratic and more tolerant society.In this challenge  Chile is convinced thatmultilateralism can and must contribute to overcomingthe insecurity currently prevailing in the world. TheUnited Nations offers such an opportunity to theinternational community. It is a forum that can andmust seek consensual solutions to the inescapableproblems now plaguing humankind."
"33",1322,"CHN",57,2002,"﻿First of all  Sir  please allow me to offer my warmestcongratulations on your assumption of the presidencyof the current session of the General Assembly. I wishalso to express my gratitude to Mr. Han Seung-soo President of the previous session of the Assembly.I wish to congratulate the Swiss Confederation onhaving joined the United Nations and also to welcomethe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste  which willsoon become a Member of the Organization.The opening of this session coincides with thefirst anniversary of the events of 11 September. Overthe past year  the international campaign againstterrorism has made headway  and now we should notonly ponder ways to eradicate the global scourge ofterrorism  but also take a broader view of the securityissues facing humankind and seek to achieve lastingpeace and universal security.At present  the international security situation isundergoing profound changes. Security has begun totake on wider connotations. While traditional militaryantagonism and conflicts have yet to be eliminated  avariety of non-traditional security concerns havebecome increasingly prominent. Security is no longer apurely military concern. It has permeated politics economics  finance  science  technology  culture andmany other areas.Security is no longer a zero-sum game. Itsmutuality is obviously on the increase  as countrieshave come to realize that they have common securityinterests and feel a greater sense of interdependence.We must overhaul the tools at our disposal toachieve security. Military means alone have provedinadequate in meeting the massive and complexsecurity challenges facing us. The indiscriminate use offorce can only lead to greater trouble in our world.This new situation calls for new ideas in the areaof safeguarding security. We in China believe in a newsecurity concept that features mutual trust  mutualbenefit  equality and cooperation.By mutual trust  we mean that countries shouldrise above their differing ideologies and social systems abandon the cold-war mentality and the power politicsmindset  and refrain from harbouring suspicion andhostility towards each other. They should hold frequentdialogues and mutual briefings on their security anddefence policies or on the major actions they are aboutto take.By mutual benefit  we mean that a country shouldrespect the security interests of others while pursuingits own  and also help to create conditions forenhancing the security of others while making itselfmore secure  thus achieving universal security.By equality  we mean that all countries  largeor small  strong or weak  should respect each other treat each other as equals and refrain from interferingin each other's internal affairs  so that internationalrelations can become more democratized.By cooperation  we mean that countries shouldresolve their disputes through peaceful negotiations engage in extensive and close cooperation on theirshared security concerns and work to prevent wars andconflicts.All in all  our new security concept is aimed atincreasing mutual trust through dialogue and atpromoting common security through cooperation.It is in the spirit of this new security concept thatwe in China have been working hard to promotemechanisms for a regional security dialogue andcooperation  actively participating in the ShanghaiCooperation Organization and in the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum and endeavouring to establish an Asia-Pacific securityframework that is for dialogue and againstconfrontation.China is actively committed to international armscontrol  disarmament and the non-proliferation process.Not long ago  the Chinese Government promulgatedthe Regulations on Export Controls of Missiles andRelated Items and Technologies and its Control List.The Chinese Government will make furtherimprovements on its export-management mechanismsfor biological and chemical dual-use items. We call onthe international community actively to undertakedialogue and cooperation in the spirit of this newsecurity concept  in a joint effort to tackle the majorsecurity concerns of the day.We should press ahead with internationalcooperation against terrorism and curb the threat ofinternational terrorism once and for all.Counter-terrorism should be pursued on the basisof international law and of the norms governing16international relations  allowing the United Nations andits Security Council to play a leading role. It shouldtake a comprehensive approach  with a focus oneliminating the root causes of terrorism. Efforts shouldbe made to prevent the arbitrary enlargement of thescope of the counter-terrorism campaign  but proventerrorists  including the East Turkestan terroristforces  trained  armed and bankrolled by the Talibanand Al Qaeda  must be resolutely stamped out.We should step up dialogue and reconciliationprocesses and facilitate the settlement of regional hot-spot issues.China supports the Palestinian people and theirjust cause to regain their legitimate national rights andto establish their own State. We support the relevantSecurity Council resolutions and the principle of landfor peace. We are opposed to violence targetinginnocent civilians  and we reject responding to violencewith violence.We stand for a political settlement of the questionof Iraq. The United Nations should play an importantrole in this regard. Iraq should implement the relevantSecurity Council resolutions in a faithful and strictmanner.We hope that India and Pakistan will soon resumedialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respectand resolve all their differences  including that overKashmir  through peaceful means.We will continue to work constructively for alasting peace in Afghanistan and its post-warrehabilitation. We support the important role of theUnited Nations in this regard.We should strengthen exchanges and dialoguesamong different civilizations and thereby avert conflictor confrontation. Differences among diversecivilizations are a basic characteristic of humanity.We have every reason to treat the achievements ofvarious civilizations kindly and to promote exchangesamong them on the basis of respect for diversity.Everyone is encouraged to draw upon the strength ofothers with a view to realizing common development.Peace and development go hand in hand. Many ofthe problems we face today may be development-related. In coping with these challenges  it is all themore important to look to development for answers. Inthe past year  the United Nations has held a series ofimportant meetings on development such as the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development. What is needed right now  is to translate the programmes andcommitments into reality.In the past year  regional economic cooperationhas continued to move forward. We feel especiallyhappy about the launching of the African Union convinced that Africa will now take fresh strides on theroad to development. At present  our developmenttasks have become more pressing. The widening wealthgap in the world must be reversed. Frequent economicand social shocks must be dealt with. The sharpeningclashes between economic development  on the onehand  and resources and the environment  on the other must be allayed. The international order and the rulesof the game  which do not fairly reflect the needs ofdeveloping countries  must be changed.We would like to make the followingpropositions. First  to establish a global partnershipgeared to development. Governments  internationalorganizations  transnational corporations and non-governmental groups are all parties to the cause ofdevelopment. The North and the South  the aid-recipient countries and international aid institutions should be equal and cooperative partners in dealingwith the global economic slowdown. The developedcountries ought to lend developing countries a helpinghand. The new round of multilateral trade talks shouldbe seized as an important opportunity for forging sucha new partnership.Secondly  to promote a balanced and steadydevelopment in the context of economic globalization.The international community needs to reform currentroles in the world economy  strengthen guidance andmanagement of the globalization process and promotea win-win situation and coexistence among countries.Thirdly  to strengthen the developing countries'capacity for self-development. Developing countriesshould opt for a development path suited to them andstrive to catch up with the tide of global economicdevelopment. The international community shouldrespect the right of developing countries toindependently choose a development path  and helpthem with capacity-building.Fourthly  in order to continue on the path ofsustainable development  we should promote abalanced development of the economy  population resources and the environment. Efforts to address the17environmental problems of individual countries shouldbe combined with those aimed at global concerns.Fifthly  to enhance comprehensive development of thepeople. Human resources are the primary resources foradvancing science and technology and for realizingeconomic and social development. In formulatingdevelopment strategies  countries should make thepeople their top priority and main beneficiary.The Communist Party of China will soon hold itssixteenth national Congress  the very first in the newcentury. Standing in the forefront of the historical tideand displaying a spirit of progressing with the times this party Congress will draw up a new blueprint foraccelerating socialist modernization in China. Ourguiding thought is to consistently represent thedevelopment requirements of China's advancedproductive forces  represent the orientation of China'sadvanced culture and represent the fundamentalinterests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinesepeople. Our historic mission is to accelerate the drivefor modernization  complete the reunification of themotherland  maintain world peace and promotecommon development.The first 10 to 20 years of this century presentChina with an important strategic window ofopportunity for its development. While takingdevelopment as our number one priority  we must graspthe opportunities  deepen reform  open the country stillwider to the outside world  promote development andmaintain stability.We will continue to pursue an independentforeign policy of peace  actively develop friendlyrelations in cooperation with all countries in the worldon the basis of the five principles of peacefulcoexistence  and facilitate international dialogue andcooperation  thus contributing constructively to a fairerand more equitable international order.There is but one China in the world. Both themainland and Taiwan belong to that one China  andChina's sovereignty and territorial integrity brook nodivision. The Chinese Government adheres to the basicpolicy of peaceful reunification and one country  twosystems; and President Jiang Zemin's eight pointproposal on how to develop cross-strait' relations andpromote a peaceful reunification of the motherland forthe current stage. We are firm in our opposition to allforms of Taiwanese independence activities and willtolerate no attempt to separate Taiwan from the rest ofChina in any fashion. All acts of Taiwan independenceare doomed to failure and our grand cause of nationalreunification will triumph."

It is a greatpleasure for my Government to welcome andcongratulate the Swiss Confederation upon itsadmission as a State Member of the United Nations.Members will agree with me that the fifty-sixthsession was a very difficult one. How can we forget thesad memory of 11 September 2001  which will cast ashadow over the work of our Organization for a longtime to come. This session in particular  as itimmediately follows the fifty-sixth  must learn all theappropriate lessons from the last session and provide anew dimension to international relations.In the opinion of the delegation of Côte d'Ivoire the renewed need to recast multilateral inter-Staterelations can be articulated  inter alia  around thefollowing themes: United Nations reform; a steadfastfight against poverty; human rights; and internationalsecurity.It has become a truism to say that if the UnitedNations had not existed  it would have had to beinvented. After more than 50 years of existence — andthis has been recognized over and over again — on thedawn of the third millennium  the United Nationswould do well to shake off the dust and adapt itself tothe new times.Along these lines  for almost 10 years we haveseen negotiations on reform of the membership and ofthe working methods of the Security Council. It is timefor specific measures to be taken so we may have acomprehensive debate based on the positions of thevarious regional groups. For our part  Côte d'Ivoire isconvinced that two permanent seats and three non-permanent seats for the African continent would be inkeeping with the times. Côte d'Ivoire is ready to makea contribution to any resolution or decision whichwould help modernize the Security Council.For 30 years following the Second World War  thepriorities of the international community were suchthings as reconstruction  decolonization and the coldwar  to name a few. Nowadays  misery and poverty which appeal to human conscience  are  as far as weare concerned  the number-one threat to internationalpeace and security.The greater the gap between rich and poorcountries  the more emigration there will be to the richcountries  whose forecasts and developmentprogrammes will then be undermined. Contrary to whatsome might think  in the opinion of my delegation thefight against poverty is an essential component ofpreventive diplomacy. Both inside and outside a givencountry  the fight against poverty is the prime operationfor the maintenance of international peace and security.My Government has understood this  and we havedecentralized our administration through theestablishment of district councils. Now it is up to the58 administrative districts to identify their own needs to establish their priorities and carry out theirdevelopment projects financed from the annual budgetunder the appropriate national legislation.With respect to the financing of a decentralizedadministration  Côte d'Ivoire takes this opportunity tothank its developmental partners for their aid andsupport  and we appeal to the international communityto make additional contributions to our decentralization15policy. I reaffirm that Côte d'Ivoire has enormouspotential and  now more than ever  offers extraordinaryopportunities for investment and partnership.We welcome the results of the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  which washeld at Monterrey from 18 to 22 March 2002  as wellas the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg  and the 2001 Doha meeting ofthe World Trade Organization. We would like to see theconclusions of those three important meetings turnedinto concrete action.We cannot repeat it enough: the efforts ofdeveloping countries will be in vain unless measuresare taken to ease the debt burden and unless theinternational community succeeds in preventing thenegative effects of globalization.After the fall of the Berlin wall  the marketeconomy became part of the economic standards of theinternational community. This new economicunderstanding means more than ever that we mustabandon the logic that says that we should have  on onehand  those who produce only raw materials and  onthe other  those who produce only finished products. Toenable the developing countries to enter the industrialage and have access to markets throughout the world we need a better organization of internationalsolidarity  and scrupulous respect for the resolutionsthat have been adopted.In the opinion of my delegation  with theimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  Africa now offers a favourableframework for the exercise of international economicsolidarity. NEPAD must remain a programme thatassists the African Union  and not a new overlappinginstitution. Côte d'Ivoire is happy to see theestablishment of the African Union  and it will play itsrole in consolidating this unique tool of internationalcooperation.While we welcome the progress realized in thepromotion and protection of human rights  Côted'Ivoire is still deeply concerned about issues relatingto the right to health. My delegation would like toreturn to the question of HIV/AIDS which  more sothan malaria  is the number-one public health problemthroughout the world. According to the Joint UnitedNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and theWorld Health Organization (WHO)  in 2001 40 millionpeople throughout the world  58 per cent of themwomen  were infected by the HIV virus. Of the 40million people who are HIV-positive  nearly 29 millionlive in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is progressing and in Côte d'Ivoire it is especially hitting the mostactive segments of the population  namely the 14-to-45age group.In spite of the many praiseworthy efforts made byCôte d'Ivoire  which has also pledged to implement auniversal health insurance system  and those made bythe international community in its fight against theHIV/AIDS pandemic  the results do not yet meetpeople's expectations. As we await a miracle cure forthe mutant AIDS virus  more than ever we have toredouble our efforts regarding prevention on the onehand  and access to medicine for the neediest segmentsof society on the other. It is also important that thestruggle be waged within the framework of ongoinginternational coordination  which is the only guaranteeof success  and that decision-makers show moreinterest in implementing the outcomes of suchcoordination.Peace and the security of goods and persons arethe alpha and omega of any development. While theend of the cold war seemed to justify a certainsatisfaction  we must recognize that recent events donot give us much reason to rejoice. The destruction oflight weapons in a few places should not let us ignorethe submerged part of the iceberg. In spite of pledgesmade  the sale of light arms in particular continues toprosper  with the resulting child soldiers and disabledpeople  not to mention all the refugees and thehomeless fleeing conflict areas.The United Nations Conference on the IllicitTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All ItsAspects  which was held last year  delivered someconclusions which were generally accepted byeveryone. My delegation hopes that very soon a reportof the Secretary-General will enable us to assess theresults of that Conference to date.In terms of nuclear weapons  the key event of thepast two years was the end of the 1972 Treaty on theLimitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems betweenthe two greatest nuclear Powers. This situation is ofconcern to Côte d'Ivoire. Therefore  my country is veryhappy to see that in the framework of a new agreementrecently signed by the United States of America andthe Russian Federation  those two nuclear Powers havedecided on a two-thirds reduction of their nuclear16arsenals over a 10-year period  zero level being theultimate objective to be achieved as soon as possible.Like other countries in the international community Côte-d'Ivoire has taken note of this major event  andencourages the two parties to pursue their effortstowards a total reduction of the nuclear threat.Here  my delegation would like to thank commend and encourage France  our long-standingpartner  which for the last three years  through itsvigorous policy of disarmament  has significantlyreduced its nuclear arsenal.Let me reaffirm the position of Côte d'Ivoire ondisarmament  which does not differ from the positionof the group of non-aligned countries. It is imperativethat everyone respect the non-nuclear zones establishedaround the world  including the one created in Africaunder the Pelindaba Treaty.The events of 11 September 2001 were anappalling atrocity which caused the immediate loss oflife of more people than ever in the history of terroristattacks. Our objective should be to avoid a repetition ofsuch attacks through concerted action  supported by theappropriate means. To combat this scourge  in ouropinion  we must grasp the problem at its roots andunderstand all its political  economic  psychologicaland moral components. So that we do not play into thehands of the terrorists  the fight against terrorismshould help bring peoples together. Therefore  thesimultaneous dialogue among civilizations and culturesmust inspire the action of the international community.Côte d'Ivoire has taken legal and economic measuresto combat terrorism. It has set out to collaborate withother parties and to develop specific legislation to fightagainst terrorism by defining and punishing infractions.My country will continue to assume theobligations of international solidarity against terrorism as laid out in Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).To do this  Côte d'Ivoire wishes to have  in addition tothe financial and logistical means it sorely lacks  thesupport of the international community with regard totraining in the legal  banking and police areas. But nomatter what  my Government will continue itscooperation with the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee  so that the fight againstinternational terrorism will yield results which willhelp us preserve international peace and security.The crisis which has shaken the Middle East fordecades is without a doubt a serious threat tointernational peace and security. The persistence of thiscrisis is a challenge that appears to expose theimpotence of the international community to deal witha conflict that  if we are not careful  could come to beaccepted as commonplace. Yet we can at least say thatsince the start of the conflict  the internationalcommunity has not folded its arms. Indeed  the UnitedNations resolutions on the questions are innumerable.The best known of them are Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338(1973) of 22 October 1973  resolutions supported bysuch forums as the Oslo and Madrid Conferences.At the centre of the conflict are the inevitableissues of the need for the Palestinians to have a viableindependent State  and of the need for the State ofIsrael to live in security and in peace with all its Arabneighbours  within internationally recognized borders.That is why it is important to welcome the Saudiinitiative which recognizes Israel's right to exist next toa Palestinian State.In that regard  Côte d'Ivoire is very happy toembrace Security Council resolution 1397 (2002) of 12March 2002  in which the Council  with theconcurrence of its five permanent members  affirmed avision of a region where two States  Israel andPalestine  live side by side within secure andrecognized borders.In Africa  we are happy to see the return of peacein Sierra Leone  in Eritrea and Ethiopia  and in Angola.We must thank the political leaders of those States andall others who  one way or another  contributed to theend of hostilities in those countries. We call on them tohelp in the ongoing process of reconciliation andreconstruction.While we welcome those positive developments we are concerned by the ongoing hostilities in Liberia the Sudan  Somalia and the Great Lakes region. Wemust all support the initiatives and the efforts of well-known individuals such as former President NelsonMandela and President Bush  and those of theinternational community  particularly the UnitedNations  the African Union  the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) and the SouthernAfrican Development Community (SADC)  for thereturn to peace and stability in this large region of ourcontinent.We urge all the sons and daughters of the regionto understand that the return of peace and17reconciliation depends first of all on them. Only theirwill peacefully to settle their disputes  whatever theirnature  will make it possible to put an end to thesuffering of their peoples.Thanks to the intelligence and good will of itspeople  Côte d'Ivoire has been able to reconcile andfind an Ivorian solution to its recent politicaldifficulties. It encourages all parties to conflicts tohave confidence in themselves and in their ability tofind appropriate solutions to the issues that dividethem  in the interest of their populations and ultimately  that of Africa.I would like in conclusion to state that while theUnited Nations has “pushed back the frontiers ofracism” (A/49/PV.14  p. 7)  to quote former PresidentNelson Mandela  it can  with genuine political will achieve equally impressive results in other areas. Wemust thus do everything we can to push far back thefrontiers of hatred  intolerance  violence and poverty orindeed to destroy those evils. Let us build a betterworld  a world of peace and progress for ourselves andfuture generations."
"35",1399,"CMR",57,2002,"﻿The delegation of Cameroon welcomes theunanimous vote that conferred upon the CzechRepublic the presidency of the General Assembly at itsfifty-seventh session. Current circumstances may notbe conducive to optimism  but the peoples of theUnited Nations are continuing to make progresstowards the future. The heads of State or Governmentof the countries of the world mapped out the contoursof that future during the Millennium Summit. Theycalled for a future world in which humankind can livefree from all fears and free from want. I am convincedthat  given your excellent qualities  Mr. President  you like your predecessor  will contribute to strengtheningcohesion and peace among all States and peoples.Cameroon welcomes the new additions to ourfamily. Switzerland  our friend  has taken up the UnitedNations banner  and the young Democratic Republic ofTimor-Leste will soon be joining it.I should also like to pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who  through histireless efforts and commitment  is consolidating  dayby day  the credibility and vitality of the UnitedNations in the eyes of its Member States and  morebroadly  in international public opinion.The United Nations  as never before  is a placefor coordination  research  action and vigilance infavour of international peace and security. Oursteadfast and determined commitment against terrorismin the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September2001 is proof of this.Cameroon has acceded to the conventionalinstruments adopted by the United Nations immediatelyafter that tragedy. We also associate ourselves fully withthe resolutions that are now enabling the gradualemergence of a new Afghanistan — one of liberty andmodernity for its people.The fight against the destructive  indiscriminateand persistent evil of terrorism must be viewed in thelong term in each of our countries and be based ondecisions agreed to at the international level. That iswhy Cameroon fully supports the convening of a high-level conference to develop a joint response by theinternational community to terrorism.Such a fight must not be merely a knee-jerkresponse. It will also require the adoption of acomprehensive approach that takes into account all the32factors of imbalance and injustice that can lead to suchcriminal activity.It is for that reason that President Paul Biyaappealed to the community of nations“to calm the international situation by doing awaywith injustice  which can provide a fertile groundfor intolerance. Such a realistic step will enableus to eradicate the causes of dissatisfaction andrevolt that  if unresolved  can lead to despair and at worst  to terrorism”.In the same spirit  we believe that our commonoffensive on terrorism must rest on legal measuresagreed to by all States  as well as on the effectiveimplementation of commitments undertaken in theMillennium Declaration. We should recall that suchcommitments are aimed at providing further solidarityamong nations and at reducing the gap between richand poor countries. Firmness without justice can onlypromote feelings of frustration and will leave theproblem unresolved.Since becoming a member of the SecurityCouncil  the pre-eminent body of our Organization  on1 January  Cameroon has made every effort to givecredence to the doctrine of a twin-track approach topeace and security. Combating international terrorismwill require the sincere and effective participation ofall States Members of the United Nations. This in turnwill require an environment of peace  stability andsecurity among Member States. As a result  we must whatever the cost  find a solution to the conflicts andtensions that  in Africa  the Middle East and Asia continue to drive fault lines through internationalrelations  among countries in the same region and evenwithin certain States.As with the fight against international terrorism the mobilization of the international community againstcrises and armed conflicts must involve both resoluteaction and openness. Cameroon is especially concernedabout the delicate question of sanctions  which areaffecting several countries. Sanctions must be targetedso as to spare innocent civilians  while the concerns ofthird States  which can be indirect victims  must alsobe taken into account.We believe the Security Council would benefit ifsanctions were viewed more favourably. This could beachieved by according them further legitimacy  whichwould enable them to have the credibility essential totheir effectiveness.As for the institutional reform of the UnitedNations  which Cameroon  like many other countries has been urging  special mention must be made of theinevitable expansion of Security Council membership.Such reforms of the principal decision-making body ofthe United Nations would permit a more integratedapproach with regard to serious regional questions andthe multilateral challenges that flow fromglobalization.Cameroon is convinced that an overwhelmingmajority of Member States are willing and able to carryout these reforms. That very ability and will have beendemonstrated by the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court; the first session of the Assembly ofStates Parties to the Statute has just been held here.We cannot overemphasize the need for solidarityto unify our nations. Support for the development ofthe countries of the South must remain a priority  asmust synergy among our States in order to define avigorous policy for environmental protection. We havenever had so many summits on these major challenges.Yet it must be noted that we have seldom adequatelymet the tremendous expectations of millions of womenand children  the great majority of whom continue tolive in precarious circumstances and with great fear forthe future of the Earth.We must ponder our failures. We must react witha surge of voluntarism that will enable us to launch adetermined attack on such great pandemics asHIV/AIDS. That is the path charted by the first ladiesof Africa  who  upon the invitation of Mrs. ChantalBiya  will meet in Yaoundé on 15 and 16 November toestablish and launch  with the help of renownedresearchers and scientists  a non-governmentalorganization called Synergies africaines contre le Sidaet les autres souffrances. At that launching  ProfessorsRobert Gallo and Luc Montagnier will moderate ascientific symposium on AIDS.In order to combat fanaticism  we must cultivatefidelity to humankind. Such fidelity must be ongoing.According to a wise African saying  “the past and thepresent become one in the single desire to preservemankind”. Today more than ever  it is our duty toaffirm our fidelity to our peoples without everforgetting the fundamental virtues on which theuniversal fabric of mankind's aspirations and dreams is33woven. I recall that we have the urgent duty to forgethe future that was shaped by our heads of State at theMillennium Summit — a world in which mankind willfinally be free of fear  of all fears  and in whichmankind shall never want.Let us build a dream together. Let us dreamtogether of that future full of hope. We would remindthose who scorn such dreams that  in the beginning there was a dream. To them  we would reiterate GeorgeBernard Shaw's words:“Some men see things as they are and say why? Idream things that never were and say ‘Whynot?'”In the beginning  there was a dream."
"36",1443,"COD",57,2002,"﻿I amhonoured and gratified once again to take the floorbefore the Assembly  to which I extend the mostcordial greetings on behalf of the Congolese people  itsGovernment and on my own behalf.First and foremost  allow me  Sir  to congratulateyou very sincerely  along with the whole of yourBureau  on your election to the presidency of the fifty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly.I wish also to convey to your predecessor Mr. Han Seung-soo  our great appreciation for theextremely important work that he accomplished duringhis term in office.Allow me also to welcome the accession to theUnited Nations of the Swiss Confederation and ofTimor-Leste as Member States.Lastly  allow me to thank the Secretary-Generalfor his dedication to universal values and for his activeinvolvement in the quest for solutions to the conflictsbesetting humankind.At a time when the whole world is rememberingthe fateful date of 11 September 2001  the Congolesepeople  its Government and I myself wish to take thisopportunity to convey once again our solidarity and ourcompassion to the American people and to the grievingfamilies around the world who were victimized in thisheinous act of terrorism.This is indeed an appropriate setting in which tourge all peace-loving and justice-loving States in theworld to commit to working together to combat thisevil in all its forms.For its part  as I had announced in my address tothe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly  myGovernment  on 21 December 2001  established anational coordinating committee to combatinternational terrorism  pursuant to Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001).The first part of my statement will focus on thestatus of the peace process in the Democratic Republicof the Congo.Externally speaking  it should be noted that  facedwith obstruction to the implementation of the Lusaka2Agreement as regards the withdrawal of foreign forces my Government  basing itself on the relevantprovisions of the Security Council that encouragebilateral discussions  has entered into the PretoriaAgreement with Rwanda on the one hand  with thefacilitation of South Africa and the assistance of theUnited Nations  and  on the other hand  it has signedthe Luanda Agreement with Uganda  under thesponsorship of Angola.The Pretoria Agreement  signed on 30 July 2002 essentially addresses the question of the withdrawal ofRwandan troops from the territory of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and the disarmament of theformer Rwandan Army (ex-FAR) forces and theInterahamwe. The Luanda Agreement  signed on 6September 2002  deals with the issue of the completewithdrawal of Ugandan troops from the territory of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  as well as withcooperation and the normalization of relations betweenour two States.Almost 45 days have passed since the signing ofthe Pretoria Agreement — half of the time period setby the timetable for its implementation — without anysignificant progress having been made on the ground.The commitment undertaken yesterday by the Presidentof Rwanda to begin the withdrawal of troops as fromnext week may mark a decisive phase in theimplementation of the Pretoria Agreement.For its part  the Government of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  consistent with thecommitments that it has undertaken  had alreadyassembled at Kamina more than 2 000 Rwandan ex-combatants  who are awaiting repatriation to Rwanda.Furthermore  it has notified the third party  as of 5September 2002  about additional informationconcerning Rwandan ex-combatants.With regard to the Luanda Agreement  it shouldbe noted that the withdrawal of Ugandan troops hasbegun and that a joint peacemaking programme hasbeen set up in the Ituri region.The successful implementation of the Pretoriaand Luanda Agreements  in particular with respect tothe withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops  willhave a clear impact on the conclusion of acomprehensive and inclusive agreement in the contextof the domestic political process aimed at nationalreconciliation and the reunification of the territory ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  with a view tothe prompt holding of free  democratic and transparentelections at all levels.Following consultations with various politicaland social groups  as well as with the Special Envoy ofthe Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  my Government suggested thatarrangements for the signing of an inclusive agreementcould begin at an early date.I would like now to turn to the particular andworrying situation that prevails in the eastern part ofmy country. I am referring to the bloody anddistressing events that took place in Kisangani andBunia; the resumed fighting in the Kivu region; therapes; the plundering of the wealth of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo; and all the other human rightsviolations that have taken place. I also have in mind theappalling destruction of fauna  flora and the ecosystemin general in the eastern part of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo.I urgently appeal to the international communityto put an end to this tragic situation  which is afflictingthe people of the eastern part of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  and to ensure that theperpetrators of these vile and barbaric acts are punishedand brought to justice.Likewise  we look forward eagerly to theconclusions of the Panel of Experts  which we hopewill be accompanied by proposals for sanctions to beimposed on those who are plundering the resources ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. This is thebleak situation that has been prevailing in my countryfor more than four years; the socio-economic situationof the people has deteriorated as a result of the war which has deprived my Government of more than halfof its resources. In order to deal with this economicdisaster and to alleviate the suffering of our people asmuch as possible  a number of measures been in placefor more than a year. The tangible effects of thesepositive measures include the stabilization of ourcurrency and of the price of major consumer goods  aswell as the resumption of cooperation withinternational financial institutions.In the same spirit  a large-scale nationalreconstruction programme is under way  aimed at therehabilitation of the basic social infrastructure so as topromote the recovery of the economy and the processof development.3I have condemned the terrorism and the tragicevents of 11 September 2001  which plunged theAmerican people and all of humankind into mourning.I have provided an updated review of the peace processin the Democratic Republic of the Congo  in particularwith regard to the Pretoria and Luanda Agreements. Ihave expressed my grave concern about the disturbinghumanitarian situation prevailing in the eastern part ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  which ischaracterized by massacres and massive violations ofhuman rights and international humanitarian law. Ihave also pointed to the particularly difficult socio-economic situation affecting the population of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  noting that it hasbeen aggravated by war and its adverse effects. If thewar persists  the Government's efforts to achieveeconomic recovery may well be completely nullified.In order to put an end to this protracted tragedy  Iearnestly appeal  through this Assembly  to the entireinternational community  to mobilize and become moredeeply involved in the quest for solutions to bringabout the reunification of our national territory and toreturn peace and stability to my country and to thewhole of the Great Lakes region.I would like to make several specific points. First I believe that a conference should be held  under theauspices of the United Nations  on peace  security anddevelopment in the Great Lakes region. My country'sdesire  in keeping with its African tradition  has alwaysbeen to live in peace and harmony with all the States ofAfrica and of the world  beginning with its neighbours.Secondly  the international community should bemore actively involved in resolving the conflict that istearing the Democratic Republic of the Congo apart. Itis clear today that the international community seemsto be forgetting the role played by Africa in thedevelopment of today's wealthy States  and is showinga degree of indifference to African issues.Thirdly  the large number of Security Councilresolutions which have  to date  remainedunimplemented.Fourthly  I am thinking of technical contributionsand the mobilization of the international community torehabilitate our ecosystem  so as to preserve thisheritage of humankind.The founding fathers of our universalOrganization  who were convinced that nations couldbe brought together only through peaceful settlementsof conflict  signed the Charter in order to ensure that noarmed conflict would be a matter of indifference to theremainder of humanity. For this reason  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  which believes deeply in theuniversal values championed by the United Nations expresses the hope that all the organs of the UnitedNations will play their role to the fullest to ensure thatwe may silence weapons wherever they are being used in order to make peace a genuine right within the graspof all of us."
"37",1490,"COG",57,2002,"﻿Thissession of the General Assembly is beginning in acontext that is still deeply affected by the memory ofthe painful events that struck the United States  andespecially our host city  just a year ago. So I shallbegin by paying tribute to the memory of the victims ofthe attacks of 11 September 2001. This sacrifice is acruel reminder of how fragile our world remains exposed to the most unimaginable threats. Humankindneeds solidarity  and the Congolese people reaffirmshere  through me  its solidarity with the people of theUnited States.The election of Mr. Jan Kavan to preside over thework of the fifty-seventh session is a tribute to hisbeautiful country  the Czech Republic  and to hisreputation as an outstanding statesman whoseexperience and knowledge will inspire and guide ourwork.To Mr. Han Seung-soo  President of the Assemblyat its fifty-sixth session  we express our earnest thanksfor his excellent work. Likewise  we express to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  our profoundgratitude and our wishes for success in the noblemission that he is brilliantly carrying out at the head ofthe Organization. Finally  we welcome andcongratulate the Swiss Confederation on the occasionof its admission to the Organization. Undoubtedly  thatis a major event for the United Nations  which therebycontinues to increase its effectiveness.Two years ago  during the Millennium Summit held in this Hall  the international expressed its wish tosee established throughout the world a climate of peaceand security favouring broad prospects for internationalcooperation  with a view to sustained worlddevelopment. During that historic meeting  the world'sleaders adopted a Declaration whose ambitions werecommensurate with the high stakes. In particular  theycommitted themselves to reducing by half by the year2015 the proportion of the world's population living inconditions of extreme poverty.Since the Millennium Summit  the internationalcommunity has convened a number of meetings whoseobjective was to improve the lives of our peoplesthrough policies of shared management  of solidarityand of preserving the future in various areas involvingthe responsibility of our States. We should periodicallyevaluate our progress  and the current session offers usthat opportunity.The absence of peace  war and insecurity  isgravely undermining humanity. Unfortunately  noregion in the world has been spared. Because ofirrationality  the Middle East  a veritable powder keg is unravelling before us. The international communitymust become further involved in the talks betweenPalestinian and Israelis in order to put an end to thecycle of violence that has ravaged that part of the worldfor so long.Our own subregion  which covers the EconomicCommunity of Central African States  over which wepreside  longs for peace and security. Havingsuffered years of war and instability  Central Africa hasonly one desire: to emerge quickly from this infernalcycle. In that connection  we should firmly seize everyopportunity available to us in order permanently toreverse old trends.In Angola  the 4 April 2002 signing of aMemorandum of Understanding as an addendum to theLusaka Protocol offers a glimmer of hope. We welcomethe signing of that agreement and  in the same spirit make an earnest appeal to the international communityto give its full support to the populations of thosecountries faced with dire poverty.The situation in Burundi remains worrisomedespite the formation of a Government of nationalunity. We ask the parties to go even further and tobegin honest negotiations that could give South Africanmediation  which we encourage  every chance ofsuccess.With regard to the Democratic Republic of theCongo  we welcome the peace Agreement of 30 July2002  signed in Pretoria between the heads of State ofthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and of Rwanda.We also see as a positive development the agreementreached a few days ago in Luanda between theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. By thesame token  we encourage the efforts of the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for theDemocratic Republic of the Congo aimed at concludingan inclusive agreement involving all the sons anddaughters of that brotherly country.In the light of the foregoing  I should like to askthe Assembly to devote all necessary attention to theactivities of the United Nations Standing AdvisoryCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa.That Committee has just held its 18th ministerialmeeting  in Bangui  Central African Republic  and willreport to the Assembly during the current session. Itsrecommendations deserve broad support from theinternational community. Central Africa needs toregain peace and stability in order to play the majorrole warranted by its immense potential.Most of the conflicts that afflict our planet havetheir roots in the extreme poverty from whichpopulations  especially in developing countries are suffering. Their poverty is marked byunderdevelopment  with all its evil effects  whichprevent them from adapting to the new context of theinternational economy.It is with the goal of stopping the cycle of direpoverty that Africa has established  along with the newAfrican Union  an original plan for its development:the New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD). NEPAD is Africa's contribution to assistingin its own development. This development choiceshares the spirit of the new partnership defined inMarch 2002 by the Monterrey Consensus and the goalsof the Rome World Food Summit and of theJohannesburg World Summit on SustainableDevelopment.Since 15 October 1997  when the transitionperiod in Congo began  my country has been facingmajor challenges.The first of these challenges  to conclude thetransition and the electoral process  has been met.This political development  in spite of the setbacks anddifficulties encountered  has led  thanks to thedetermination of the Congolese people  to theestablishment this year of new democratic institutionsfollowing free and fair general elections.The achievement of that first objective has givenus ample opportunity better to take up the otherchallenges and priorities ahead of us  namely thestrengthening of peace and security  the consolidationof national unity and democracy  the promotion ofhuman rights  economic reconstruction  and therevitalization of international cooperation.Our determination to engage in active anddynamic international cooperation is reflected inparticular in our effective participation in CentralAfrican activities through the Economic and MonetaryCommunity of Central African States and theEconomic Community of Central African States  ofwhich Congo holds the presidency; in our vision of acommon future for the peoples of the subregion; and inour resolute commitment to the Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment.It is with great pleasure and conviction that Iconvey to the Assembly the optimism and high hopesof the Congo  a State that has reclaimed its place inthe community of nations and intends to keep it. Itwishes to serve as a genuine haven of peace  well-being  prosperity and modernity for current and futuregenerations.It is with current and  in particular  futuregenerations in mind that we have resolved  along withfive other Central African States  to wage a widespreadcampaign to preserve forests  animal life andbiodiversity in the Congo River Basin.We welcome the determination of the UnitedStates of America  France  Germany  Great Britain Japan and South Africa  as well as that of majorinternational organizations  specialized non-governmental organizations and forestry companies totake an active part in what we call the Congo BasinInitiative.It is also with the goal of speeding up theimplementation of the objectives of sustainabledevelopment and of a healthy environment that my12country is committed to acceding  in the comingmonths  to the Kyoto Protocol.The Congo hopes to be a State that unreservedlyabides by the universal principles and values of humanrights  peace  fundamental freedoms and goodgovernance.There can be no doubt that this vision is sharedby all of our States. It is the basis our of Organization whose principal objective is to work for peace andfreedom throughout the world.The United Nations must tirelessly and resolutelywork daily for the triumph of peace and freedom. Letus not forget this. We cannot forget that the UnitedNations was create to save succeeding generationsfrom the scourge of war'. It was created essentially forpeace."
"38",1537,"COL",57,2002,"﻿I greetyou  Your Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan of the CzechRepublic  President of the General Assembly  which Iaddress for the first time.A short distance from here  on the fateful day 11September  2 801 citizens of the world died. InColombia  violence claims the same number of victimsevery month. Forty three million Colombians  peace-loving people  are experiencing one of the world'sworst humanitarian crises. Every year Colombia buries34 000 of its own  victims of violence. We have lost 10per cent of our youth. Last year the country registeredthe highest homicide rate in the world: 63 per 100 000inhabitants.During the past five years  we have experienced8 000 acts of collective destruction  more than thoserecorded for any other cases of violence in the world;280 villages were the object of guerrilla and8paramilitary attacks with serious consequences forlocal civilians and the armed forces. The terroristattack carried out during my inaugural ceremony killed21 ordinary people. Two million people  40 per cent ofthem children  have been forcibly displaced underpressure from violent groups. That is the equivalent ofthe simultaneous displacement of the communities ofWashington and Manhattan. During the past five years 16 500 people have been kidnap victims. Yesterday  sixchildren were kidnapped and one of them is still beingheld.Just as the 11 September terrorist attacks movedthe entire world and triggered justified and universalcondemnation  mankind should be shaken by attackssuch as the one carried out by guerrillas on 2 May2002  in Bojay·  a village of 1 000 inhabitants. Theykilled 117 civilians who had taken refuge in the church.Such violence makes our people poorer everyday  discourages investments  hampers economicgrowth  diverts valuable resources and prevents usfrom overcoming our economic and socialbackwardness. Violence absorbs four per cent of mycountry's gross domestic product. Hijackings kidnappings and assaults are daily occurrences on ourmain highways  including the one that joins our twolargest cities. Imagine a similar situation betweenBrussels and Paris  or New York and Boston.Today  Colombians are making a great effort toaddress the problem with public order policies  Statereform aimed at defeating corruption and politicalchicanery and greater economic growth and socialinvestment. The main objective of our democraticsecurity policy is to restore the rule of law. Security isnot for persecuting real or imagined ideologicalenemies or maintaining a one-party regime. The aim ofdemocratic security is to protect all citizens in apluralist nation  open to fraternal and creative debate.Democratic security is for all Colombians and isintended to ensure that peasant farmers are not drivenfrom their land; that members of the businesscommunity are not kidnapped; that journalists are notthreatened; and that the missions of bishops  priests nuns  preachers and educators are respected. It is alsointended to ensure that union leaders can freelyexercise their actions; political leaders can move aboutwithout fear; and that human rights advocates can workwithout threats.As civilian commander-in-chief of the armedforces  I am committed to rigorously observing andrespecting human rights. Failure in this regard maylead to appeasement  but it would never bringreconciliation. Our emergency measures do not restricthuman rights  but rather demand the observance ofrules  for example with regard to the mobilization ofcitizens  in the name of freedom of movement  toprevent explosives from continuing to be transported toassassinate people.We respect debate. The security policy that isbeing implemented is not aimed at silencing criticism but rather at confronting violence. That policy isirreversible.The number of military and police personnel inColombia is low: 3.9 per 1 000 inhabitants. New Yorkhas 42 000 police officers  while all of Colombia has75 000. We must strengthen our armed forces. We havedecreed a wealth tax that will be paid by high-incomebusinesses and citizens. The additional tax revenueshould amount approximately to 1 per cent of the grossdomestic product.As part of the implementation of the democraticsecurity policy  our Government has called on thesolidarity of a million citizens to cooperate voluntarilywith the armed forces and justice officials. An essentialelement of a socially oriented constitutional State iscitizen support for its legitimate institutions. Itconstitutes the individual's commitment to thecommunity  without which the State loses its socialnature. We must break citizen fear of the guerrillas andparamilitaries  and we must create community-basedlinks with democratic institutions. To a large extent  theefficacy and transparency of the armed forces dependon citizen cooperation.The Colombian problem jeopardizes thedemocratic stability of the region. We need the world'sassistance to resolve it. I ask for the world's helpbecause my Government has made the decision todefeat terror and to ensure that these four years do notend in a renewed victory for crime or in new evidenceof State and societal vacillation before the arrogance ofthe violent.It is imperative that the sources of terrorfinancing be eliminated. That is why we must conquerdrugs and kidnapping.9There is concern about weapons of massdestruction within the United Nations  and we sharethat anguish. But we must understand that drugs have amassive capacity for destruction  equivalent to that ofthe most feared chemical weapons.We are determined to eliminate them. We requestthe same level of commitment from the world. Wecannot continue with timid half-actions and decisions.While we delay action  more drugs are producedand traded by terrorism. I call on fellow members: donot send us your weapons. Eliminate your markets fordrugs and chemical precursors. Help us with aerialinterdiction and drug seizures in the Pacific and in theCaribbean. We need resources to pay our farmers todestroy drugs and work to restore our forests.Last week  Carlos Enrique Arenas  a 29-year-oldpilot serving with the Colombian navy  father of a2-year-old daughter and a second child on the way and his co-pilot  Roberto Enrique Guardo  the fatherof three young children  disappeared in the ocean.The helicopter they were piloting crashed afterintercepting a speedboat carrying more than two tonsof cocaine. Sacrifices such as this demand the supportof all nations to defeat drugs  especially since untilnow we have only managed to seize 20 per cent of thedrugs that are shipped from our country.A United Nations resolution  Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001)  orders the seizure of bankaccounts  investments and other assets of individualswho commit terrorist acts. That resolution hasremained a dead letter in those countries where theresources that finance terrorist acts in Colombiacirculate.My Administration's commitment to security isnot opposed to dialogue. Quite the contrary  we wantdialogue. This is why we have requested the goodoffices of the United Nations through a special adviserof the Secretary-General. That is the way to begin aserious peace process  one that starts with the cessationof violence.The United Nations Charter tells us that dialoguewith those who commit acts of terror is possible only ifthose acts are halted. The pain of thousands ofColombians caused by the kidnapping of their lovedones  the list includes former presidential candidateIngrid Betancourt; several members of Congress;members of state assemblies; the Governor of my ownstate  a former minister and tireless worker for peace;members of the armed forces  and hundreds of ordinarypeople  demonstrates that we need humanitarianaction that does not fuel violence but that leads usalong the path of reconciliation.The world has plenty of analysts of Colombianproblems  and plenty of critics of our society and oursuccessive Governments. We need less rhetoric andmore action  that is  real contributions to solving theproblem. We call for effective cooperation  because theviolence is financed through the international drugtrade and is waged with weapons not made inColombia.Like other nations  we suffer dire poverty injustice  low investor confidence  high debt and abudget deficit. We have always honoured and willcontinue always to honour our international financialcommitments. We are making unprecedented efforts tofreeze operating expenditures and to increase taxes.But we need significant bilateral and multilateraleconomic support to invest and to expandemployment  to begin to pay the social debt. Avictory over violence will trigger economic growth andcreate resources for social development  which in turnwill consolidate peace.One thought: the price of a pound of Colombiancoffee was once more than $3; it is now around 60cents. International banks and cooperation agenciesshould redouble their commitment and resources inColombia. The money will not to be used for wastefulexpenditures or to salvage bankruptcies  but will ratherbe invested  in the interest of the poor  to ensuregovernability.The people of Colombia are proud  hard-working democratic and sensible; their spontaneity has not beenstifled by their suffering. The nation has the most soliddemocratic tradition  widely recognized long-termeconomic performance  a highly diversified industrialbase  a productive structure increasingly gearedtowards international markets  and an enormouspotential for small democratic enterprises.Representatives of the peoples of the world: withyour commitment and support  and with our owndetermination  Colombia will be freed from the slaveryof violence and will be more prosperous  with greaterjustice."
"39",1577,"COM",57,2002,"﻿Ayear has gone by since the entire world mourned thevictims of the World Trade Center tragedy andcondemned the barbaric acts most formally. Today from this rostrum  on behalf of the Union of the26Comoros and the Comorian people  I wish to evoke thememory of all those who in the United States andelsewhere have suffered injustice at the hands of thosewho have acted outside faith or law. We condemnterrorism in all its forms.Allow me to congratulate President Kavanwarmly on behalf of the delegation of the Union of theComoros  which I have the honour to head. I also wishto convey the trust and confidence that we have in himto lead the work of this session  based on hisexperience  personal qualities and diplomatic expertise.Permit me also to convey to His Excellency Mr. HanSeung-soo our great pleasure and admiration byrecognizing the outstanding work he did as President ofthe previous session. I wish to convey a strong tributeto His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  our Secretary-General  for his constant devotion in the service of ourOrganization.The Union of the Comoros heartily welcomesSwitzerland and Timor-Leste as new Members of ourOrganization. The United Nations is an organizationwhose duty it is to assure humankind the conditions ofliving in peace  dignity and prosperity. This is anenormous and large-scale task that surely poses certaindaunting difficulties that we will need to overcome.This must be so  because in no way must we or shouldwe shrink away from obstacles and challenges. Thisinstitution must be the true guarantor of the hopes ofpresent and future generations.This requires a true awareness of its universality which calls for reforming its main organs. Theseorgans must be in a position to reflect and adapt to thereality of the present world.Furthermore  and in a different context  this newpolitical framework must go hand in hand withdevelopment  a development that takes into account theinequalities  but also the specificities of each place.There are many evils gnawing at our planet  but theyaffect us in different degrees. The advances of thetechnological world of the North contrast with thefierce struggle of the South  even now in the twenty-first century  to achieve the most basic livingconditions. The extreme poverty of the South  AIDS tuberculosis and malaria are all offensive to humandignity. The South's struggle for survival is meaningfulonly if it finds some response in the North. Thispresupposes recognition of the equality of rights and ofinequality of means to guarantee these rights.In Africa  initiatives such as the New Partnershipfor Africa's Development (NEPAD) have been devisedto address and remedy a socio-economic situation thathas led to the most atrocious effects. But we mustrecognize that NEPAD's viability also depends on theNorth's good will to contribute to finding anappropriate solution to the main problems of theAfrican continent.Our countries  on the other hand  place theirhopes in the recommendations of the World Summit onSustainable Development recently held inJohannesburg. This world forum took into account thehuman being and all the dimensions of life andsurvival. In other words  we hope that  by the year2015  we will actually see a reduction in poverty byhalf  so that we may address priorities other thanhunger  disease and war  among others.The time has come for our countries to save ourpeoples from the many agonies of war and fromtraumatic effects on our children and to put an end tothe unprecedented losses suffered by our economiesdue to the exorbitant cost of weapons that harm ourlives and those of our children. It is time to becomeaware of our heavy responsibility to ensure that futuregenerations are not sacrificed to history.From another standpoint  war seeks only to proveone's force to another  and prove one's capacity todestroy. From that perspective  it can only be nefarious.This has led Comorians to banish any attempt to doanything that would lead us to confrontation. Wereinforce our internal forces  which  together with ourwisdom and the culture of the Comoros  lead us toforgive. We base this on our religion  Islam  whichadvocates tolerance  peace and love of neighbour.Guided by these sacred principles  the people ofComoros  after four years of upheaval in its socio-political sphere  finally found itself  foundreconciliation and decided to heal its old wounds.Thus  on the initiative of President Azali  the variousparties of the Comoros came to an agreement ofnational reconciliation  with the support of theOrganization of African Unity and the InternationalOrganization of la Francophonie.Following this agreement and after establishing aTransitional Government of national unity  pluralistic transparent and democratic presidential elections for27the Union of the Comoros and for the islands tookplace. The contest was run in a legitimate way and thewinner was the outgoing President  Colonel AzaliAssoumani. Following the elections  every island wasgiven its own president  with full responsibility forself-management. Toward the end of this year  we willhold legislative elections intended to establish nationalinstitutions and to provide the country with aparliament. This next stage is also of crucialimportance. In fact  with the establishment of theparliaments  we will be able to address and settle manyoutstanding issues not settled by the constitutions ofthe islands and the Constitution of the Union. Theseconstitutions have often referred to organic laws  whichmust be enacted by the parliaments.We must recognize that this silence  this absenceof legislation  may have led to misunderstanding  butthis has not interfered with the regular functioning ofthe administration. Furthermore  commissions havebeen established to review modalities that are to enablethe progressive transfer of powers to the authorities ofthe autonomous islands subject to the provisions of thevarious constitutions. It is obvious that beginnings areoften difficult. In these circumstances  this transfer  aswell as the procedures for the distribution of Stateproperty  have sometimes met with disagreement fromone quarter or another. This is understandable in acountry that had formerly been managed under adifferent system.This situation can be explained  in our view  bythe absence of organic laws that would determinedetails of essential aspects currently subject to protestby various parties. We trust that with the establishmentof the Parliament  these misunderstandings will beallayed and will yield to the harmony needed tomanage the political life of the autonomous islands andof the Union.I wish to convey the deep appreciation of thepeople and the Government of the Comoros to all thebrotherly and friendly countries and all the regionaland international institutions which have to datesupported us in every respect. Their cooperation hasbeen indispensable  and  together with the wisdom ofthe people of the Comoros  has enabled us to avoid theworst in a small country where we are all one family.We pay enthusiastic tribute to their actions. Equally  itis our wish that crises in other parts of the world willhave a satisfactory conclusion. We appeal to allpartners of the Comoros to continue supporting ourcountry as it pursues its socio-economic development.Without minimizing the question of the Comorianisland of Mayotte  I wish to refer to that subject last ofall. This is a matter of great concern to the people andthe Government of my country. In fact  this is a matterof sovereignty  and thus of dignity and patrioticconscience  which we cannot abandon  because bydoing so we would be abandoning our identity  ourculture  our civilization  our history and our geography.In our quest for a solution to this problem  a singleprinciple guides us and a single will moves us toresolve this painful dispute with respect forinternational law and in accordance with the relevantresolutions of the United Nations  while at the sametime preserving the benefits we enjoy within theframework of our relations with France. In that respect speaking on behalf of the Government of the Union ofthe Comoros  I fervently appeal to France to ensurethat a dialogue begins.The strategy we advocate has the advantage ofinsuring that the Comorian Island of Mayotte will notremain in isolation  that it will be incorporated into aregional framework which will bring it closer to itssister islands as well as to its neighbours in thesubregion. We therefore hope the same considerationswill prevail on the French side so that together we canreach an agreement which will guarantee greater calmand better understanding within our long-standingrelationship.Whenever I address this question I recall the greatTunisian poet Abu al-Qasim al-Shabbi  who invites usnot to despair and to rely on reason. If people ever want lifeThen time must respond Night must dissipate and shacklesMust be shattered.'"
"40",1616,"CPV",57,2002,"﻿I would likeat the outset to congratulate you  Sir  on your electionto preside over the General Assembly at this session.We are confident that with your renowned skills anddiplomatic experience you will guide the work ofAssembly to a very successful conclusion. I assure youthat you will be able to count on the full support of thedelegation of Cape Verde.I would like to acknowledge the strong leadershipand guidance of you predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo who presided over the Assembly during a particularlydifficult time  when important steps were taken toimprove the efficiency of the General Assembly withview to reinforcing the role of our Organization inresolving the issues confronting the internationalcommunity.Allow me also to convey a special word ofappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for thewise and capable manner in which he has guided theUnited Nations  especially in managing the millenniumagenda  which has produced particularly importantresults for the international community  such as theoutcomes of the Monterrey and Johannesburg summits.Cape Verde welcomes the admission of the SwissConfederation to the United Nations. We are sure thatSwitzerland's presence in the United Nations can onlybe of to benefit the Organization  given that country'svaluable and renowned diplomatic experience.Likewise  we welcome the forthcomingadmission of East Timor to the United Nations. At thistime  I am pleased to recall that Cape Verde has alwaysstood by the Timorese people in their struggle for self-determination and independence. That young countryand its people have paid a very high price in order tohave their right to existence be recognized. It istherefore a duty of the community of nations tomobilize all the support necessary to enable that youngdemocracy to affirm itself and to make up for thedecades lost to destruction and violence.The tragic events that struck vital and emblematiccentres in the United States on 11 September 2001deeply shocked the world. The whole internationalcommunity mobilized itself and expressed its solidaritywith the United States of America  while at the sametime adopting measures adjusted to the challengesposed by international terrorism. Cape Verde wasamong the countries that reacted promptly to SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and remains firmlycommitted to its implementation.The shockwaves of that catastrophe were felt inall latitudes and affected many different aspects of therelations between States. These are reflected adverselyin lack of economic growth; in increased expendituresfor defence and security and the consequent impact onthe distribution of resources; and in the daily routinesof citizens of every country in the world throughrestrictions on the mobility of people. In certainregions of the world  there is an increased risk ofmilitary confrontation that  should it occur  would haveimmeasurable consequences.Thus  today  the question of international securityhas assumed unprecedented importance in the relationsbetween States  and the United Nations is called uponto play a decisive role in its assessment and5management. Diplomatic means should be privilegedand pursued in the context of the Security Council.A safer world is a more just world. It is crucialthat the United Nations strengthen its intervention andcoordination capacities in international cooperation topromote economic and social development as theguarantee of a climate of peace and security throughoutthe world. It is impossible to create a climate of peaceand security while more than half of the world'spopulation remains subject to poverty  malnutrition disease and ignorance. The international communityhas to strengthen its commitment to ensure that themillennium goals are achieved in time to give meaningto the lives of millions of our brothers and sisters especially those in the least developed countries  whotoday look to the future without any hope.At the expense of great efforts  determination andhigh social cost  many of those countries haveimplemented the deep reforms required by theirbilateral partners and international financialinstitutions. Regretfully  in many cases  instead ofreceiving increased support to consolidate the reforms these countries are being devastated by their debtburden  public development assistance is beinggradually reduced and they have yet to enjoy access toforeign private investments. The populations are however  still waiting for the reforms to produce thepromised results.It was against this backdrop that the Monterreyand Johannesburg summits prompted greatexpectations  but the results turned out to be relativelymodest. Even so  if the consensuses reached at thosesummits are effectively implemented  they mayconstitute an important starting point for developingcountries. The financial commitments announced inMonterrey and the goals set in Johannesburg in thevital sectors of water and sanitation are a contributionof particular importance to the implementation of themillennium goals. The most important thing now is thatthe decisions adopted actually be implemented andefforts redoubled in order to reach new consensus inthe other sectors essential to the planet's sustainabledevelopment.Cape Verde recognizes the efforts that have beenmade by the United Nations to foster the developmentof the least developed countries and small islandStates. In this regard  we welcome the creation of theOffice of the High Representative for the LeastDeveloped Countries  Landlocked DevelopingCountries and Small Island Developing States  inaccordance with the decisions of the Third UnitedNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.Cape Verde has achieved positive results in itsstruggle for economic and social development. Thepeople of my country have demonstrated an enhancedpolitical maturity that ensures stability and peace andthe normal functioning of democratic institutions.Power changes have taken place at both the local andthe national levels. The most recent United NationsHuman Development Report ranked Cape Verde in aprivileged position on the African continent.However  in spite of significant advances made inthe past 20 years at the political  social and economiclevels  Cape Verde suffers from a structural imbalancebetween national production and domestic expendituresthat has resulted in a permanent deficit in the balanceof current transactions  as well as other economicimbalances. Unemployment is high and poverty affectsa significant portion of the population.The country's development has been marked byadvances and setbacks prompted by its naturaleconomic vulnerability as a small island with a lack ofnatural resources  a weak production base and a strongdependence on external financial flows. Theseconditions are aggravated by the country's location inthe Sahel region  which subjects it to prolongeddroughts that weaken the environment.In light of all this  and given the low rainfallregistered to date  we are facing the prospect of anotherdifficult year. This has prompted the Government toadopt emergency measures to alleviate the effects ofdrought on the most vulnerable. To that end  we havecalled for the solidarity of all Capeverdeans while  atthe same time  we hope to be able to rely on the activesupport of the international community.Poverty is another of Cape Verde's limitationsand poverty reduction is one of the major challengesfacing Capeverdean society. At this time  we areworking in collaboration with our bilateral partners andUnited Nations agencies on medium- and long-termstrategies to combat poverty.In the coming years  the country will have to findrapid and durable solutions in order to maintain thefundamental macroeconomic balances  further andconsolidate structural reforms  expand the production6base and create competitive advantages for theeconomy at both the external and the internal levels in short  solutions leading to economic growth and areduction of the unemployment rate. In that context our efforts are more than ever in need of the properpartnerships and foreign private investment so that wemay pursue the country's development process begunwith national independence in 1975.We are pleased to note that some encouragingsigns have begun to appear on our continent. There is afresh wind blowing in Africa. This year  we saw thebirth of a new continental organization  the AfricanUnion  as well as a new and original partnership  theNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).With these were also born renewed hopes for a morepromising future for the African people. The globallyfavourable reception to these two African initiatives isa good omen for the continent. Africa thus seems to beon its way towards finding its own path bystrengthening its endogenous capacities to resolve theproblems inherited from colonization and conflictsoften prompted by external interests. Africa seems tobe on the way to finding its own path by strengtheningits endogenous capacity to resolve the problemsinherited from colonization and to settle conflicts oftenprompted by external interests.In fact  the African Union and NEPAD are basedon a new foundation  as well as a new environment inour continent that is opening new prospects for peaceand development. We note with satisfaction thesubstantial progress made in Angola  Sierra Leone andthe Great Lakes region  which points to the definitiveresolution of conflicts that a year ago did not seem tohave a solution. In that context  we should recognizethe important role of the efforts of the United Nationsand the Organization for African Unity in seekingsolutions to those conflicts  as well as the decisiveaction that some countries have taken to promoteunderstanding between belligerent parties.We congratulate the Angolan Government andUNITA on finally having found the solution to aconflict that for many years devastated that country.The political conditions are now in place to carry outthe enormous task of national reconstruction. However the gravity of the humanitarian situation demandssubstantial support from the international communityto help the Angolans find a rapid and suitable solutionthat will prevent their problems from growing.The positive signs that could predict a new era forAfrica should not cause us to lose sight of the scopeand the complexity of the challenges we face  whichresult from historical circumstances  environmentaldisasters and an accumulation of human errors. Themost recent report of the United Nations Conference onTrade and Development on least developed countriespoints out that sub-Saharan Africa is poorer today thanit was 20 years ago. At the same time  the evaluation ofeconomic progress made in the past decade within theframework of the United Nations New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s is disappointing.On the other hand  the spread of pandemics  inspite of certain limited success in the fight againstthem  and the serious food shortages that have affectedsouthern Africa reveal the seriousness and persistenceof the problems that Africans must solve.The fact that United Nations cooperation withAfrica is being strengthened is noteworthy. That isattested to by the increased attention being devoted tothe continent's problems. Examples are recent SecurityCouncil meetings that have focused on the situation inthe continent  the creation of an Ad Hoc AdvisoryGroup of the Economic and Social Council oncountries emerging from conflict and yesterday'sGeneral Assembly meeting devoted to NEPAD. In thatcontext  we would also note some of the decisionsstemming from the Monterrey and Johannesburgsummits.It is our hope that this session of the GeneralAssembly will make an important contribution tofacing the challenges and will enable the UnitedNations to strengthen its role as a promoter of peace understanding and cooperation among all people of theworld."
"41",1662,"CRI",57,2002,"﻿Allow me to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan  and throughhim the Czech Republic  on his well-deserved electionto preside over the work of this session of the GeneralAssembly. Allow me also to congratulate Switzerlandon its recent admission to membership of the UnitedNations and to congratulate the Republic of Timor-Leste on its imminent admission.Fifty-eight years ago  the founders of theOrganization undertook to promote social progress andbetter standards of life in larger freedom.Unquestionably  the main purpose of the UnitedNations is the promotion of justice and well-being forall. We must reaffirm that commitment today. We mustdedicate ourselves to building a more just  free harmonious and happy society. We must indeed drawthe maximum advantage from the benefits of jointaction and cooperation in order to create a world ofmutual advantage. As stated in the MillenniumDeclaration  we have a collective responsibility touphold the principles of human dignity and equality atthe global level.However  we are still very far from reaching thatgoal. In the last 10 years  more than 3.5 million peoplehave died in civil wars. One billion three hundred andeighty million people live in extreme poverty  and 854million do not know how to read or write. Democracy justice and the enjoyment of civil and political rightsare far from being universal. We believe that we needto address the miserable and alarming situation of theworld's children. More than 30 000 children die everyday of diseases that are easily preventable. There aremore than 300 000 child soldiers in the world. Morethan 150 million children suffer from malnutrition dueto a lack of food  and many millions go withoutschooling. This situation is as serious as — or moreserious than — the effects of terrorism  which arethemselves abominable. However  these problems donot draw the public's attention and are relegated to asecondary place on the world's agenda.We have stopped half way in our struggle tocreate a better world. Many examples attest to thisbitter fact. It is right for us to celebrate the holding ofthe first elections after an armed conflict or the end ofa dictatorship. However  those are just the first stepsdown the path of a democratic way of life. Unless theUnited Nations commits itself to ensuring thesustainability of democracy  elections  regardless oftheir inherent value  will not necessarily mean a victoryin the fight for human rights. Democracy must be aninstrument for attaining equitable development andcreating favourable conditions for peoples who investtheir hopes in it.The sustainability of democracy can besafeguarded though the promotion of the fundamentalsocial values of dialogue  harmony and reconciliation.That is also done by combating extreme poverty andthe growing economic gap between various socialgroups  which are ills that weaken the social fabric anderode confidence in political institutions. Financial20crises foster conditions favourable to the existence ofextremist and opportunist groups seeking to overthrowdemocratic Governments. Greater internationalcooperation for development is necessary toconsolidate democracy. It is for that reason that weurgently call upon developed nations to implement theMonterrey Consensus  and in particular to fulfil theircommitment to increase official developmentassistance. Costa Rica fully supports United Nationsefforts to promote and strengthen democracy. But wealso emphasize that the United Nations should not giveany less attention to the creation of the economic andsocial conditions that will help to strengthen andpreserve democratic institutions throughout the world.We also believe that globalization  with its rapiddevelopment of information and communicationtechnologies and growing economic and commercialinterdependence  offers us tremendous opportunitiesfor economic and social development. We mustcertainly take advantage of those opportunities tocreate a better world for all. However  globalizationalso poses serious dangers. Structural barriers financial imbalances and the lack of capital forproductive and social investment can cause theeconomic collapse of entire regions. Subsidies restricted access to international markets and capitalflight distort free competition. Globalization maywiden the gap between the wealthiest and the poorestsectors of society. The digital divide may exclude themost vulnerable from the benefits of the moderneconomy and cast a long shadow over the futures ofthose left behind. It is essential that we make greaterefforts to protect the most vulnerable groups andnations.The United Nations must call on the developedcountries to open their markets and to abolishsubsidies  thus enabling developing countries to haveaccess to the benefits of globalization. Thus  incombating inequality and extreme poverty  we willbuild more equitable and just societies.Human dignity has been championed ever sincethe founding of the United Nations. Governmentcorruption  in all its forms and at all levels  is agenuine breach of human rights. It is outrageous thatunjust leaders should enrich themselves by corruptmeans and thus impoverish their peoples. It isscandalous to see how certain rulers divert public fundsto their private accounts while reducing their peoples tothe most appalling poverty. At the same time  theGovernments of some States Members of the UnitedNations fuel corruption by granting tax deductions forbribes offered abroad. There are even some MemberStates that protect corrupt leaders under the guise ofbanking secrecy. The United Nations should forbid allsuch acts and prevent the granting of amnesty  asylumand travel visas to those who seek to evade justice.The protection of human rights may be weakenedwithout multilateral protection  monitoring andsanctions mechanisms. Costa Rica advocates thecreation of a new generation of human rightsmechanisms to provide greater protection to allindividuals. This effort has already born its first fruit inthe form of a draft optional protocol to the Conventionagainst Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or DegradingTreatment or Punishment. That legal instrument recently adopted by the Economic and Social Council will be submitted to the General Assembly forconsideration in the next few days. I urge all Statesactively to support the draft as a sign of theirunequivocal commitment to human rights and to theprimacy of the dignity and integrity of all humanbeings.We welcome the recent entry into force of theRome Statute establishing the International CriminalCourt. Human kind at last has an effective  independentand impartial judicial organ with jurisdiction to try themost serious crimes against human dignity. We mustnot weaken it.While the United Nations upholds the principle ofthe peaceful settlement of disputes  requiring justmeans and institutions to resolve differences  theInternational Court of Justice — the United Nationsmain judicial organ and guarantor of international law responsible for ensuring the rule of law in internationalrelations and for preventing arbitrary and casuisticinterpretations of legal norms — has become a purelyrhetorical device. Very few States Members of theUnited Nations have accepted its mandatoryjurisdiction without reservation  while others havemade the situation even worse by unjustifiablywithdrawing or modifying their acceptance of itsjurisdiction. Only 12 nations accept the mandatoryjurisdiction of the Court without reservation orcondition. To ignore the authority of the highestjudicial organ of the society of nations is tantamount toclosing the door to justice and endangers the integrityof the international legal order.21What alternative is there for nations if theycannot rely on judicial bodies to settle theirdifferences? The only alternative is force. It is essentialfor all States Members of the United Nations to acceptwithout condition the obligatory jurisdiction of theInternational Court of Justice. Only thus will we beable to create a more just  peaceful and secure world.A more just world will necessarily be morepeaceful. Justice demands respect for others and fortheir freedom — in other words  tolerance. Peace inmany regions of the world is seriously threatened byintolerance. In the Middle East  the rights of thepeoples of Israel and Palestine are being violated. Theintolerance of one leader is today making a countrylike Iraq the possible setting for endlessly bitter war.How different the situation would be if it had a fairGovernment respectful of human rights. The world hasalso witnessed with concern the growing disputebetween India and Pakistan and the threat of nuclearwar in that region.My country would like to see greater toleranceprevail in the Taiwan Straits. We hope to see a justsettlement that would fulfil the desires of the entireChinese people. Costa Rica has historically enjoyedand continues to enjoy close friendly relations with theRepublic of China on Taiwan. Creative agreementshave been reached in many international organizationsto permit the participation of the Republic of China intheir work. The world would be a far more peacefulplace if we were able to find an innovative accord toallow that country and its people to be represented withdignity in this and other international organizations.While it is a principle of the United Nations toprevent violence and to achieve lasting and stablepeace  there are Governments that transfer weapons torebel and terrorist groups and States Members of theUnited Nations that scorn efforts being made fordisarmament and the reduction of military expenditure.We call for the adoption of a legally bindingframework convention to regulate the arms trade. Ourexperience as a disarmed nation has taught us that notspending on weapons is the best decision for thosecountries that are truly committed to the well-being oftheir peoples.We urge the nuclear States truly to committhemselves to disarmament negotiations. We deem itnecessary to adopt a comprehensive convention toprohibit the use of nuclear weapons. In the meantime all States must renounce the development of newnuclear weapons and ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.We cannot commit ourselves only half-way tohuman dignity  equality and justice. We must not allowour children  the future generation  to be able tocondemn us for doublespeak. If we can do that  we willbe making a true contribution to their inheritance of abetter world."
"42",1731,"CUB",57,2002,"﻿Ayear ago  the General Assembly had to be postponedbecause of the ruthless crime committed on 11September. There was then a worldwide wave ofsolidarity towards the people of the United States and particularly  towards the families of the almost 3 000innocent victims of that unjustifiable terrorist attack.The conditions were created for setting up agenuine international alliance under the auspices andleadership of the United Nations  with absolute respectfor the purposes and principles enshrined in its Charter.Nearly all countries  above and beyond ideological political  cultural and religious differences  expressedour willingness to collaborate actively with thisendeavour of unmistakable common interest.However  another vision was imposed. In anunusual fashion  it was stated that whoever did notsupport the war decided upon by a single countrywould then be on the side of terrorism. It was evenannounced to the Security Council that that countryreserved the right to launch future attacks on its ownagainst other nations. A unilateral war was thenunleashed  whose death toll is still unknown to us andwhose most tangible consequence is probably the blowto the credibility of the United Nations and tomultilateralism as a means to cope with the complexchallenges currently ahead of us.What is the outcome today? There are greaterfeelings of hatred  vengeance and insecurity  which arenot helpful in the fight against terrorism. Dangerousxenophobic and discriminatory tendencies threaten theexistence of a plural and democratic world. There hasbeen a step backward in the field of public freedomsand civil rights.In the meantime  there is a lack of political willby certain powers to rigorously apply  withoutselectivity and without double standards  the 12existing international legal instruments on terrorism. Inaddition  no advances have been made in the definition so indispensable today  of State terrorism.For its part  Cuba — a victim of terrorist acts forover four decades  which stated its opinions in theAssembly with poise and firmness and unwaveringlycondemned the crime of September 11 and terrorism assuch  but which also opposed the war out of ethicalconsiderations and the respect for international law —signed and ratified the 12 international conventions tocombat terrorism and adopted a national law to fightthis scourge. It has cooperated fully with the work ofthe committee set up for such purposes by the SecurityCouncil and  at the bilateral level  it proposed to theUnited States Government the adoption of aprogramme to combat terrorism  which was incomprehensibly  rejected by that Government.Until today  and despite the fact that it has notdeveloped and has no intention ever to develop nuclearweapons  Cuba has not been a State party to the Treatyon the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  for it isan insufficient and discriminatory instrument allowingthe establishment of a club of nuclear powers withoutany concrete disarmament commitments. However  as asignal of the clear political will of the CubanGovernment and its commitment to an effectivedisarmament process that ensures world peace  ourcountry has decided to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In doing so  wereaffirm our hope that all nuclear weapons will finallybe totally eliminated under strict internationalverification.20In addition  and despite the fact that the onlynuclear power in the Americas pursues a policy ofhostility towards Cuba that does not rule out the use offorce  Cuba will also ratify the Treaty for theProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America andthe Caribbean  known as the Treaty of Tlatelolco  thatwas signed by our country in 1995.On a day like today  I would like to repeat Cuba'sremarks at the last session of the General Assembly:“Only under the leadership of the UnitedNations will we be able to defeat terrorism.Cooperation  and not war  is the way. Thecoordination of actions  and not imposition ... isthe method. ...“Cuba reiterates its condemnation ofterrorism in all of its forms and manifestations.Cuba reiterates that it will not allow its territoryever to be used for terrorist acts against thepeople of the United States or of any othercountry.” (A/56/PV.50  pp. 21 and 22)Why have we not seen the same zeal with whichthe war in Afghanistan was unleashed in the search fora just and lasting solution for peace in the Middle East?Why have some refrained from uttering even a singleword to condemn the aggressions against the territoryof Palestine and the crimes against its people? Why hasthere not been any condemnation of the selectiveassassinations and the use of the armed forces againstthe civilian population? Why are there assurances ofimpunity for the actions of the Israeli army  thus tyingthe hands of the Security Council? Why have there notbeen any firm actions to implement the SecurityCouncil resolutions that ensure the proclamation of anindependent and sovereign Palestinian State  with EastJerusalem as its capital? Why is the only superpoweron the planet acting differently from one case to theother? Why is there no end to the suffering of thePalestinian mothers whose children are also murdered like the innocent people on 11 September? Thesequestions should be answered by those who in this Hallcarry upon their shoulders the responsibility for what iscurrently happening in the occupied Palestinian andArab territories.A new war against Iraq already seems inevitable;an aggravation of the situation of constant aggressionthat that people has lived in over the last ten years. Thebuzzword now is “pre-emptive war”  in open violationof the spirit and the letter of the United NationsCharter.Cuba defends principles  not expedience.Therefore  although its supporters may feel upset  itemphatically opposes this war. Cuba is not driven byan anti-American spirit  even when its Governmentmaintains and strengthens a 40-year-old blockadeagainst our people. But refraining from telling the truthout of cowardice or political calculation is notcharacteristic of Cuban revolutionaries. Therefore Cuba hereby states that it opposes a new militaryaction against Iraq. It does so while recalling that atone point it supported the Security Council resolutionasking the Iraqi Government to end the occupation ofKuwait.We believe that the development of weapons ofmass destruction today would be insane  because theonly possible way that we envision for world peace isthrough general and complete disarmament  includingnuclear disarmament  and the rechannelling of themoney currently spent on weapons to address the diresocio-economic problems of humankind.The Arab countries have been emphatic in theirrejection of this war  and most European countries donot approve of it. The international community isincreasingly concerned about the announcement of anew war on the basis of unconfirmed allegations anddisregarding the obvious reality that Iraq cannot pose adanger to the United States.If the United States Government unleashes a newwar against Iraq  either by imposing it on the SecurityCouncil or by deciding upon it unilaterally inopposition to international public opinion  we will bearwitness to the emergence of a century of unilateralismand the forced retirement of the United Nations. It willthen seem that the cold war years — with its distantmemory of bipolarism  mistakes and contradictions —were not as futile and perilous as the era that is nowinexorably looming over the world.The United Nations has to be saved. Cubadefends the need both for its preservation and for itsmost profound reform and democratization  but all thismust be accomplished through respect for its Charterand not by rewriting it or distorting its purposes andprinciples. The General Assembly must ultimately beallowed to play the role laid down for it in the Charter.The Security Council has to be rescued from thedisrepute and doubts that are so rightly weighing it21down  so that it may become a truly representativebody. I am talking about the presence of the third worldand not about military power as a justification formembership of a democratic body; I am talking abouteliminating the veto and other antidemocratic practicesfrom a transparent body; and I am talking about puttingan end to the secret conspiracies and to the substantivedecisions made in private by a mere few and thenimposed on the rest.Today  when it is more threatened than ever  Cubastrongly defends the need to preserve multilateralism ininternational relations. That is why we have witnessedin frustration the disappointing completion of thenegotiations for the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court  which Cuba supported on theunderstanding that it would be a truly impartial  non-selective  efficient and independent body tocomplement national justice systems. To use theSecurity Council as a tool to amend de facto theinternational treaty that gave birth to the Court  or toimpose upon others humiliating bilateral agreements compelling them to violate their internationalobligations deriving from that instrument  is not onlyarrogant  but also irresponsible.The International Criminal Court now vaunted isnot the body that we need and have fought for  subjectas it is to hegemonic political interests and already apotential victim of manipulation  and bound from itsinception to the decisions of a permanent member ofthe Security Council. What real international justicecan be expected of a body that lacks a definition of thecrime of aggression or that will receive instructionsfrom the Security Council either to call off or topostpone a trial indefinitely at the request of one of itspermanent members? Who can guarantee that the Courtwill not end up becoming an instrument at the serviceof interventionism and domination by the mostpowerful countries?Cuba reiterates here today what it expressed atthe recent Johannesburg Summit: a reworking ofinternational financial institutions is called for. Alegitimate replacement for the International MonetaryFund is called for. It is essential that the work of theWorld Bank be aimed at supporting the genuineexercise by over 130 third world countries of their rightto development. It is essential that the United Nationssystem be provided with new financial resources tofight poverty  underdevelopment  disease and famine. Itis essential that the World Trade Organization berescued from the interests of a handful of rich andpowerful countries and transformed into an instrumentat the service of a fair and equitable internationaltrading system.The meagre results derived from the Monterreyand Johannesburg conferences and the justified waveof annoyance and uncertainty in their wake once againraise the issue of the lack of political will by the majorindustrialized Powers to relinquish a portion of theirprivileges in order to produce a real change in theunfair and unsustainable world order that is currentlyvisiting impoverishment and hopelessness upon twothirds of the planet's population.I recognize that Cuba's remarks may not beaccepted by some in this Hall. I even understand thatthey could be interpreted as a tirade against a countryin particular. However  that is not the reason. Wordsmust be used to uphold the truth and that is what Cubahas done and will always do. We are a small  noblepeople that long ago proclaimed that  for all Cubans “motherland is humankind”."
"43",1777,"CYP",57,2002,"﻿I would like  Sir  toextend to you my warmest congratulations on yourelection as President of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. I have no doubt that your longexperience and proven diplomatic skills willsuccessfully steer the work of this session. I would alsolike to extend my appreciation to your predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his effective anddetermined guidance during the work of the fifty-sixthsession.Cyprus joins other States in extending a warmwelcome to the newest Member of the United Nations Switzerland  and we look forward also to welcomingEast Timor.The opening of this session coincides with a timeof overwhelming challenges for the internationalcommunity. The fact that the global problems are sonumerous demands a determined and collectiveresponse and necessitates the enhancement of the roleof the United Nations as the leading mechanism insecuring world peace and stability.Cyprus would like to reaffirm its strong devotionto the United Nations and its commitment to the causeof international cooperation and multilateralism  soeloquently advocated and defended in the Secretary-General's statement to the General Assembly on 12September 2002.It is our firm belief that the internationalcommunity should act in accordance with theprinciples of the United Nations Charter and that allUnited Nations resolutions should be implemented.Such an approach will not only enhance the credibilityof the Organization  but will also facilitate theachievement of permanent solutions based onobjectivity  justice and international law.In the case of Cyprus  numerous resolutions ofthe General Assembly and the Security Council haveyet to be implemented. Contrary to its obligationsunder the Charter  Turkey shows its defiance by callingfor the acceptance of the so-called realities broughtabout by its aggression. Twenty-eight years havepassed since the tragic summer of 1974  and the peopleof Cyprus  both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are still suffering from the terrible consequences of theTurkish invasion and the continuing militaryoccupation of 37 per cent of the Republic's territory.The Government of Cyprus  however  does notwant to engage in polemics with Turkey. On thecontrary  we believe that we should move beyondconfrontation towards a common future of prosperity democracy and regional cooperation. In this respect both sides should seize the moment and take advantageof the current window of opportunity for theachievement of a just and viable settlement of theCyprus problem  based on Security Councilresolutions  which represent the verdict of theinternational community and its collective wisdom.The time to engage in a serious  meaningfuldialogue is now  given the unique convergence ofpositive factors  including the renewed interest of theinternational community  the personal involvement andcommitment of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan to whom we express our appreciation  and theEuropean Union accession process for Cyprus.Regrettably  the international community has yetto see the greatly anticipated change of attitude on theTurkish side. The Security Council  in its statement of9 July  authoritatively declared that14“the Turkish Cypriot side had been lessconstructive in its approach so far  and haddeclined to support the goal of resolving the coreissues”. (Press Release SC/7444)The Council also strongly underscored the needfor the Turkish side to cooperate fully in the ongoingeffort for a comprehensive settlement  taking into fullconsideration the relevant Security Council resolutionsand treaties.We invite Turkey and the Turkish-Cypriotleadership to heed the call of the internationalcommunity and abandon its unacceptable policy ofdivision and communal segregation. Their position infavour of a “two sovereign States” solution and of thedenial of the rights of refugees to their propertyrepresents an anachronism in a globalized world — aworld in which we view diversity as an enrichment andare bound together by integration  the quest fordemocracy and the rule of law. Most importantly  sucha policy cannot lead to a settlement or to reconciliation and would thus perpetuate the suffering and the plightof all Cypriots. We call on the Turkish side to respectSecurity Council resolutions  and the high-levelagreements signed by Mr. Denktash himself  whichprovide for a bi-zonal  bi-communal federation andwhich envision a State with a single sovereignty  singlecitizenship and a single international character.In keeping with the interests of our people andwith the need for regional stability  our vision forCyprus represents a departure from the passions of thepast. We see the future of our country in a reunitedfederal State  with membership in the European Unionand with the human rights and fundamental freedomsof each and every citizen fully protected. We are awarethat the overwhelming majority of Turkish Cypriotsshare this vision and long for reunification and for acommon future in the European Union  with all thesafeguards of a modern  democratic and effective State.They know that the accession of Cyprus would offer toall its citizens security and social and economicadvancement  especially for the Turkish Cypriotcommunity.As for our side  President Clerides  who has beenparticipating in the talks in a constructive and positivemanner  thereby earning the respect of the internationalcommunity  will continue to show determination andfarsightedness so as to fully safeguard the interests ofCyprus and its people.One year has passed since the heinous attacks of11 September  which dramatically changed theinternational political climate. The immediate actionsof the United Nations in the aftermath of the attacksreaffirmed the strong determination of the internationalcommunity to counteract the global threat of terrorism which transcends geographical regions and religions.Cyprus believes in the necessity of globalmobilization and collective action against terrorism under the auspices of the United Nations. It hasbecome evident that in the fight against terrorism  theimportance of an individual country is not related to itssize or its geographic location. Every State has a vitalcontribution to make in the struggle to combat thisthreat to our common values. The Government of theRepublic of Cyprus reaffirms its commitment to thisstruggle through full implementation of all relevantinternational conventions and protocols relating toterrorism  as well as of Security Council resolutions.Our determination has been explicitly stated at thehighest level and through our ratification of all 12 ofthe international conventions and protocols pertainingto international terrorism.Two recent international events deserve specialmention  since they have created a momentum forinternational cooperation on issues of a political economic  environmental and legal nature. The firstsession of the Assembly of States Parties to the RomeStatute was a veritable landmark in combatingimpunity and deterring genocide  war crimes  crimesagainst humanity and aggression.On the other hand  the World Summit onSustainable Development reaffirmed the necessity forcoordinated and effective international action in theform of a joint effort to overcome the challenges ofeconomic disparity and environmental degradation. Itis now imperative to achieve the effectiveimplementation of all the commitments that have beenundertaken. Turning a blind eye to nature's warningswill exacerbate the problem and make theirconsequences for the global ecosystem irreversible.Cyprus also reiterates the need for joint efforts toimplement the Millennium Development Goals and theMonterrey Consensus. Moreover  my country attachesparticular importance to strengthening the NewPartnership for Africa's Development  which representsa viable opportunity for the African continent to escapemarginalization and underdevelopment.15The situation in the Middle East remains fragile;its repercussions could seriously threaten stability farbeyond the region. Cyprus  as a neighbouring Statewith close relations to the parties involved  supports allinitiatives aimed at achieving a just settlement  basedon international law and United Nations resolutions including the efforts of the Quartet. Such a settlementwould lead to both peace and stability and wouldensure normal relations and security for all thecountries of the region. It would also have to includethe fulfilment of the inalienable rights of thePalestinian people through the creation of their ownState and the termination of occupation. Mostimportantly  it would put an end to violence andreinforce the voices of moderation and cooperation. Wereiterate our condemnation of all acts of terror including suicide bombings. As in the past  we standready to assist the parties in any way they feel that wecan contribute  including by hosting meetings on theisland.Cyprus attaches great importance to the role ofthe United Nations in the field of disarmament. It willtherefore continue to support international action aimedat strengthening multilateral instruments ondisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction. In this spirit  I wish to inform theAssembly that the Government of the Republic ofCyprus has recently proceeded  in cooperation with theUnited Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus  with thedestruction of a significant number of weapons and hasdecided unilaterally to demine the buffer zone.Moreover  Cyprus is in the final stage of ratifying theOttawa Convention on anti-personnel mines.The general debate of this session is nearing itsend. The distinct focus of this session has been thegalvanization of world opinion with respect to thenecessity of implementing United Nations resolutions.Cyprus has long been advocating respect for all UnitedNations resolutions  without double standards orexceptions. We are convinced that this would bring uscloser to the shared vision of collective security  peaceand justice envisioned by the founding fathers of theOrganization."
"44",1801,"CZE",57,2002,"﻿Let me start bysaying how pleased I am to see a representative of myown country presiding over this session of the GeneralAssembly. It is the first time that the Czech Republichas had the honour of chairing this supreme body ofthe United Nations. I am grateful to all who made thispossible by supporting our aspirations. I wish you  Mr.President  every success in the performance of thisimportant function  a function which was raised to sucha high standard by your predecessor  Han Seung-soo ofthe Republic of Korea.Representing the Government which assumed itsfunction this July  I would like to confirm thecontinuity of Czech foreign policy  with its emphasison the Euro-Atlantic dimension but also with a trulyglobal reach and a strong involvement in multilateralcooperation. I should also mention that the Governmentof the Czech Republic has made its active participationin the fight against terrorism and against theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction one of itstop priorities.A year ago at this time  the whole world wasshocked by the horrific terrorist attacks on the UnitedStates of America on 11 September. The appallingdimensions of those attacks revealed the nature of thenew threats that the international community iscurrently facing. Our response must be firm. We mustmove from the policy of containment to the policy ofactive struggle against international terrorism. At the24same time  we need to discuss issues that may be thesource of  or a fertile ground for  violent acts of asimilar nature.This November  Prague will host the summit ofNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and theEuro-Atlantic Partnership Council. The CzechRepublic will support NATO's enlargement to includeadditional countries from Central and Eastern Europe.At the same time  we are aware of the importance ofNATO and European Union relations with the RussianFederation  Ukraine and the Mediterranean countries.We also anticipate that the Prague summit will mark animportant milestone in the history of the alliance inconnection with its transformation to meet such currentsecurity challenges as international terrorism and otherasymmetric threats. We are convinced that these stepswill contribute to strengthening the stability andsecurity of the world as a whole.The Czech Republic is paying great attention tothe problem of Iraq. We advocate the unconditionalimplementation of the relevant Security Councilresolutions  including those concerning the renewal ofarms inspections  disarmament  the release of detainedKuwaiti citizens and the return of confiscated Kuwaitiproperty. The current regime in Iraq  because of itsefforts to develop and produce weapons of massdestruction and its failure to comply with the will ofthe international community  represents an enormousrisk not only for the security and stability of the MiddleEast region  but for the international community as awhole. I can assure the Assembly that the CzechRepublic supports the peaceful resolution of disputes ininternational relations.However  our nation has its tragic experiencewith never-ending concessions to aggressive regimes.We must not forget that peace must sometimes bedefended by force. The Czech Republic considers theletter by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq to theSecretary-General as a reaction to the firm stand of and the pressure by  the international community. Thispressure on the Iraqi regime must continue until allSecurity Council requirements are met in full.The Czech Republic is also closely following thedevelopments in the Middle East. Let me recall that ourpreference in this regard has always been for a peacefuland just settlement of the problem in line with SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 1403(2002). The only meaningful option is to continuenegotiations with the objective of stabilizing thecurrent situation as a step towards achieving completeand lasting peace in this region. The Czech Republicshares the vision of peaceful co-existence betweenIsrael and an independent and democratic PalestinianState  based on mutual trust and arrangements coveringall security concerns. In this regard  we welcome thepromising results of the Quartet meeting held earlierthis week.With regard to peace and security  we recentlywitnessed some encouraging progress in the resolutionof armed conflicts in Africa  namely  in Angola  SierraLeone  Liberia and the Democratic Republic of theCongo  as well as in other areas  including the Balkansand Afghanistan. We welcome and support the positivechanges. For example  the Czech Republic is devotinglong-term attention to relations with the States ofSouth-Eastern Europe and to the stabilization efforts ofthe international community in the western Balkans.This year  the Czech Republic became a participant inthe Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe  which weregard as an important instrument for the economicrenewal and reconstruction of the region.As for Afghanistan  we consider peace  stabilityand democratization a key factor  both for the furtherpeaceful development of the entire region  as well asfor the wider international context of the fight againstterrorism. The international community has to increaseits efforts to stabilize the security situation and supportthe economic renewal of Afghanistan  including thebreaking of its economy's dependence on thecultivation of opium.Important components of the United Nationsagenda include the areas of disarmament  arms controland non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.The Czech Republic supports the process of the gradualreduction and destruction of nuclear arms within theframework of the ongoing process of theimplementation and achievement of the universality ofthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons and the coming into force of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Similarly  theCzech Republic is working to achieve both theuniversality and rigorous implementation of theChemical Weapons Convention  including thedestruction of existing arsenals  and the strengtheningof the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Wealso wish to see a renewal in the activities of theConference on Disarmament and the commencement of25substantive talks on a fissile materials cut-off treaty.We invite member States of the Conference to take adecision concerning the enlargement of itsmembership.The Czech Republic supports steps to strengthenthe authority and effectiveness of the United Nations.This includes the reform and enlargement of theSecurity Council  the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly  adapting peacekeeping operations in linewith the Brahimi report  efforts to transform the cultureof reaction to a culture of prevention and makingchanges in the Economic and Social Council and itssubsidiary bodies  among other things  as a response tothe challenges posed by goals of the MillenniumDeclaration and recent major United Nationsconferences.One of the major challenges currently facing theinternational community is to ensure that all countrieshave fair access to the benefits of globalization. Issuessuch as development assistance and cooperation  debtrelief for highly indebted developing countries andnon-discriminatory participation in a multilateral tradesystem  together with what we call good governance are key both for further economic progress in manyparts of the world and for preserving favourable livingconditions for future generations.In that context  the Czech Republic welcomes thesuccessful conclusion of the Monterrey Conference onFinancing for Development  held earlier this year  andof the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg just a few weeks ago. TheSummit reinforced the determination of theinternational community to pursue the goal ofsustainable development and  most importantly stressed implementation  time-bound goals and specificcommitments  responsibility and accountability. Let usnow make sure that the core message of Johannesburgis not forgotten. Let us hope that the Summit isfollowed by concrete actions at the global  regional national and local levels  including through initiativessuch as the New Partnership for Africa's Development.The Czech Republic attaches great significance tothe strengthening of international law and respect forhuman rights. We are determined to seek an earlyconclusion of a general United Nations convention oninternational terrorism. We also welcome theestablishment of the International Criminal Court. Ibelieve that the Czech Republic will join the largegroup of parties to the Rome Statute in the near future.The Czech Republic is conscious of thecontribution of the United Nations to promoting respectfor  and protection of  human rights. We call for aconsistent approach to fulfilling the obligations enteredinto  in particular in relation to the advancement ofwomen and the protection of the rights of the child including in situations of armed conflict. We advocatethe prevention and gradual elimination of all forms ofracism and discrimination  including that againstmembers of ethnic or religious minorities  persons withdisabilities and older persons and a ban on torture andthe death penalty. We are paying very close attention tothe draft optional protocol to the Convention againstTorture and other Cruel  Inhuman or DegradingTreatment or Punishment. The Czech Republic willactively promote the adoption of the draft protocol bythis session of the General Assembly.This session of the General Assembly will beremembered  inter alia  for the admission of two newmembers  Switzerland and East Timor. I welcomeSwitzerland most cordially to the United Nationsfamily  and I look forward to welcoming East Timor.Their entry into the Organization represents a furtherstep towards completing the universality of themembership of the United Nations  the achievement ofwhich the Czech Republic unanimously supports andwhich represents further proof of the vitality of ourOrganization.I could stop here. But before I finish  allow me totake advantage of this occasion to raise two issues.First  I would like to reaffirm the continued interest ofthe Czech Republic in supporting the activities of theUnited Nations Information Centre in Prague  whichlast year was housed in new premises — the so-calledPrague United Nations House — also seatingrepresentative bodies of other organizations of theUnited Nations system. And finally  on behalf of thepeople of the Czech Republic  I wish to warmly thankall who generously provided humanitarian and othertypes of assistance to my country after it had beenstruck by devastating floods last August. At thatcritical time  we saw an enormous wave ofinternational solidarity  and the floods thus contributedto a coming together among ourselves  our neighboursand the rest of the world.26"
"45",1863,"DEU",57,2002,"﻿First of all  Ishould like to wish you every success  Mr. President  inyour responsible office. We are delighted that you  arepresentative of our Czech neighbours  will presideover the General Assembly this year. I also express mysincere thanks to the outgoing President.I endorse the statement of the Danish presidencyof the European Union.One year ago  the world was shaken by the terrorof 11 September  which was disdainful of human life.Civilian aircraft were transformed into guided missileswhose deployment had been planned without anyregard for human life. The devastating consequencesdestroyed families  shattered hopes and tore peopleapart  regardless of their age  gender or religiousaffiliation. Three days ago  we remembered the victimsin a moving ceremony here in New York. We have notforgotten the images of 11 September; we have notrecovered from the shock. Our solidarity with theUnited States is unbroken. We understand ourAmerican friends. Just like them  we are not preparedto live under the sword of Damocles that terrorismrepresents.The murderous attack on the people and theAdministration of the United States was also an attackon all open societies. Countless States mourn theircountrymen among the thousands of World TradeCenter victims. The attack could have struck any opensociety  but the terrorists consciously chose the UnitedStates as a symbol of freedom and democracy.We know that the new totalitarian challenge isalso directed at us all. Since 11 September 2001  thecommunity of nations has had to look at the question ofpeace and security at the dawn of the twenty-firstcentury from a whole new angle. We will not be able tonegotiate with terrorists like Osama bin Laden. His aimis to kill as many innocent people as possible  thuscreating the maximum degree of terror and fear. If theterrorists succeed in acquiring weapons that are yetmore horrific  they will deploy them against us allwithout hesitation. Therefore  we must work togetherin the international coalition against terrorism toovercome and destroy that international terroristnetwork. The highly dangerous combination ofreligious hatred  smouldering regional conflicts terrorist attacks and the danger of the deployment ofweapons of mass destruction must be prevented at anyprice.But  above all else  we must not forget: on theone hand  terrorism must be fought resolutely by themilitary and police; on the other  we need to resolve thepolitical and social conflicts quite rightly emphasizedin the Millennium Declaration  as they form thebreeding ground for the emergence of terrorism. Optingfor one approach and neglecting the other risks failure.Our common goal is for the people in ourcountries to be able to live in safety and freedom  andwithout want. To achieve that  we need a system ofglobal cooperative security that  unlike the formerbipolarity of the cold war  includes all levels of globalpolicy relevant to security: the relations among great17Powers and their alliances as well as the potentialdanger of regional crises and the threat posed byasymmetrical conflicts. For one thing is clearer thanever after 11 September: terrorism threatens worldpeace just as much as civil war and regional conflicts.Such a system  therefore  must not be toothless  butrather must function in all three fields through reliableverification systems and enforceable sanctionsmechanisms. I am convinced that developing such acomprehensive system of global cooperative securitywill be our central political task for the twenty-firstcentury.This problem can be solved only throughmultilateralism — that is  if nations work together.Terrorism does not stop at national borders  andshaping globalization is a task that Governments canno longer tackle alone. Thus  the United Nations has amajor role to play in developing this security system; itis the most important forum for establishing globalrules. No other organization has comparable legitimacyand credibility. Decisively strengthening its ability toact by continuing the reform path of the Secretary-General is  therefore  a central focus of German foreignpolicy.The developments in Iraq fill us with graveconcern. Saddam Hussein's regime is a brutaldictatorship. Under his leadership  Iraq has attacked itsneighbours Iran and Kuwait  has fired missiles at Israeland has used poison gas against Iran and against itsown Kurdish population. The regime is horrendous forthe Iraqi people and a risk to the region. For thatreason  an effective containment policy and reliablemilitary control of the no-fly zones have beenimplemented and a strict sanctions regime against Iraqhas been introduced since the Gulf War.The regime in Baghdad must not own or producethe means for mass destruction or the systems todeliver them. Despite binding demands from theSecurity Council  Saddam Hussein refuses to providecredible and verifiable answers to the pressingquestions posed by the community of nations regardinghis weapons of mass destruction. Therefore  the UnitedNations not only must maintain the pressure on theIraqi Government but also must intensify it.We welcome the fact that President Bush  in hismost recent speech  turned towards the SecurityCouncil. Even if it becomes very difficult  we must doeverything possible to find a diplomatic solution.The Security Council and Member States mustmake it unequivocally clear to Baghdad that theunrestricted and unconditional re-admission of theweapons inspectors is the only way to avert a greattragedy for Iraq and the entire region. The IraqiGovernment must implement all relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions in their entirety and without delay.We do not  however  want any automatismleading to the use of military force. The fight againstinternational terrorism remains perilous. We have notyet managed to fully stabilize Afghanistan. Explosiveregional conflicts in Kashmir  the Middle East and theCaucasus must be resolved or at least effectivelycontained.Certain central questions arise for us. Have alleconomic and political means of pressure been trulyexhausted? What consequences would militaryintervention have? What would it mean for regionalstability? What effect would it have on the Middle Eastconflict? Are there new  concrete findings and facts?Does the situation as assessed justify the taking of agreat risk  namely  taking responsibility for peace andstability in the entire region for years or even decadesto come? Would such action gain the consent of theArab neighbours? What consequences would it havefor the continuation of the global coalition againstterrorism? In the face of these open questions  we feeldeep scepticism with regard to military action and thushold to our approach.I would like to pose the further question ofwhether a peaceful solution to the question of theMiddle East could not contribute considerably more tothe establishment of regional stability  to the successfulfight against terrorism and to the effective control anddisarmament of weapons of mass destruction. In thatway  would the regime in Baghdad not be isolatedmuch more effectively  thus generating politicalpressure for change? Would this cooperative approachto finding a new order for the region not be a morepromising way to bring democracy to the MiddleEast — one that would be supported by the regionalPowers?Nowhere is the connection between terrorism andregional conflict more obvious than in the Near andMiddle East. The breakthrough to peace is therefore ofparamount importance in that region of the world. Theconsensus among the international community ofnations on the Middle East question is now greater than18ever. We must all pull together to achieve the goalenvisaged by President Bush for 2005  that of twoStates  Israel and a democratic Palestine  living asneighbours within secure and recognized borders. TheEuropean Union has devised a road map to achieve thatgoal. An early conference on the Middle East couldhelp to build bridges and accelerate the process.Together with our European Union partners  we areready to make a considerable contribution in thatrespect.A comprehensive peace in the Middle East mustalso include Lebanon and Syria. Saudi Arabia'ssignificant initiative contains the assurance that theArab world would then also be ready to fully normalizeits relations with Israel.Without a just and lasting solution to regionalconflicts  we will not be able to eliminate therecruitment base for terrorists and thus successfullycounter the asymmetrical threat. Afghanistan is anobvious example here. The Taliban system hascollapsed there and the Al Qaeda network has largelybeen destroyed. We are still a long way from being ableto call the situation in the country stable and secure but progress can be noted. The implementation of theprovisions of the Bonn Conference agreement beganwith the formation of a legitimate InterimAdministration. The process that was launched on thePetersberg was taken to the next level with theconvening in June of the emergency loya jirga. For thefirst time in years  the Afghan people have the chanceto lead a life of dignity based on self-determination.The people of Afghanistan will only grow incourage  however  when they see and feel that theinternational community is also standing by its pledgesfor the reconstruction of their country. Thecommitments of the donor countries must materializein the form of concrete projects.A system of global cooperative security must bebased on a comprehensive security concept. This mustembrace not only military security but also theeconomy  human rights  democracy and culture.“To achieve a safer world  we must create a betterworld”: that is how President Bush summed up thesituation in his impressive speech to the GermanBundestag last May. Shaping cooperative globalsecurity therefore also means shaping a new globaleconomic order. Account must be taken of the needs ofall — the developing and the developed world alike.Resources must be more fairly distributed and poorercountries must be able to participate in internationaltrade and take advantage of the opportunities ofglobalization. This will necessitate free market accessfor all  as well as the realization of economic andpolitical freedoms and a just and reliable legalframework.We must not close our eyes to the problems ofAfrica  in particular. The food situation in the South ofthe continent is a particular source of concern.Countless people are going hungry and comprehensiveassistance is needed there. In Zimbabwe  however  theformer granary of Africa  a wholly irresponsible policyis the reason for the difficult situation. In Zimbabwe hunger is caused principally not by failed harvests ordroughts but by self-destructive governance — a policyof keeping a grip on power through the suffering of thepeople. Such a policy relies upon the fact that theinternational community's humanitarian conscienceand readiness to assume responsibility will reduce theconsequences. We must hold this policy up against thebenchmarks defined by Africa itself in the frameworkof the New Partnership for Africa's Development.Climate and energy policy is a key component ofthe new global economic order. The Kyoto Protocolcan be seen as a milestone in global climate protection.I am delighted that several countries have recentlyannounced plans to ratify the Protocol  and hope thatthis will happen as soon as possible so that it can enterinto force. In the long term  a sensible energy policy —and that means  above all  the promotion of renewableenergy sources and economical energy consumption —is the best solution to the climate problem. Work musttherefore start today. Let us not forget that difficulteconomic and ecological problems  with their socialand humanitarian repercussions  will increasinglyendanger stability and security too.The protection of human rights must be one of thepillars of a global security system. All efforts to securepeace will fail if human rights are not protected andmade a reality. We need a binding global set of valuesto prevent and overcome conflicts that emerge throughinequality  injustice and the denial of freedom. Here too  States are called upon to play a decisive and activerole. Moreover  we must be careful today to ensure thatbasic human rights are not annulled under the pretextof combating terrorism. No one has the right to an“anti-terrorism bonus”.19Cooperative global security will have to measureup to the binding legal framework in which it isembedded. It is imperative for the globalization processto be flanked by a growing set of international rules because international law and the rule of law constitutethe indispensable foundations for peaceful and orderedcoexistence. That is why the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court is so important to us. ItsStatute entered into force on 1 July; Germany  alongwith all the other members of the European Union  isamong the 79 States to have ratified it. The Assemblyof States Parties gave the green light this week to theestablishment of the Court. Next spring we willcelebrate its opening in The Hague. The InternationalCriminal Court will start work as soon as possible andas efficiently as possible. But it must not be weakenedin its work from the outset.My country is applying for a non-permanent seaton the Security Council for the period 2003-2004.Germany wants to play an active role in developing theinternational security system within the United Nationsalong the lines that I have outlined. I would like to askall members for their vote in the election on 27September."
"46",1901,"DJI",57,2002,"﻿In a yearof frightful tragedy and uncertainty  we were at leastfortunate to have the charisma and leadership of Mr.Han Seung-soo  as President of the fifty-sixth sessionof the General Assembly. We also take this opportunity Mr. President  to warmly congratulate you. Wewelcome the admission of the Swiss Confederation tothe United Nations family  and we are pleased at thefuture status of East Timor.Under the enlightened leadership of Mr. KofiAnnan  the United Nations has rediscovered itsrelevance and its credibility. The reform measures hehas implemented in recent years have enabled bettercoordination  better information-sharing  strengthenedcohesion and a stronger strategic direction. Today theUnited Nations is working more and more closely withcivil society to fight disease  address the challenges ofpoverty and respond to humanitarian crises. TheOrganization has also built a meaningful partnershipwith private sector enterprises  aimed at havingdeveloping countries benefit from their expertise andresources.In that regard  the Monterrey InternationalConference on Financing for Development and theWorld Summit on Social Development  held inJohannesburg  have highlighted the unprecedentedcollaboration of various decision-makers  such as theUnited Nations  Governments  the private sector international financial institutions and civil society.Last week  during numerous commemorativeceremonies marking the horrible events of 11September 2001  it was obvious that the world hadbeen left traumatized. The reverberations of 11September are still palpable throughout the UnitedNations system and the world. Indeed  within less than24 hours  the Security Council took decisive action 12declaring that the 11 September attacks posed a threatto international peace and security. The importantresolution on the fight against terrorism  SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  established a generalprocedure for verifying that every country isimplementing the relevant provisions of the resolution in order to eradicate that scourge.Our resolve and determination to fight the threatof terrorism has undoubtedly been strengthened. Theevent itself alerted us to understanding and perceivingcertain basic truths: human vulnerability andinterdependence  the mobilization of a realinternational coalition in a short time  if need be  andour common resolve to eradicate the criminals whotake innocent life  regardless of nationality  religion sex and colour.Presiding over the official ceremonies markingthe anniversary at the United Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan the Secretary-General  said that:“Everything that we work for — peace development  health  freedom — is damaged bythis horror. Everything that we believe in —respect for human life  justice  tolerance pluralism and democracy — is threatened by it. Itmust be defeated — and it must be defeated by aworld acting as one.” (SG/SM/8376  para. 7)Therefore  combating terrorism requires moreaggressive law enforcement measures everywhere.In order to eradicate that horror  almost allcountries have initiated an extraordinary series ofactions  which have converged towards a completereorientation of their policies  and particularly theirforeign policies.We have witnessed countries pursuing policies toreach out to others  to strengthen ties  to share globalvisions and to forge new strategic alliances. There is nodoubt that the events of 11 September 2001 have led tothe forming of new alliances and the strengthening ofexisting ones. However  it should not be a surprise thatthis has also generated stricter controls on themovements of people  particularly people of certainreligions  backgrounds  complexions and regions.There is no doubt that we are living in a dangerousworld in which vigilance is called for. However  whiletaking all that into account  let us be careful not todebase our grief for the victims and their families. Asan editorial in a well respected newspaper stated:“What happened a year ago was terrible  butour shock and our respect for the suffering ofthose left behind should not cloud our judgementabout unrelated issues”. (The Independent 11 September 2002)In the Secretary-General's words of 11 September2002  on the first anniversary of that unspeakabletragedy:“Today  we come together as a world communitybecause we were attacked as a world community.“...“May the memory of those who perished on 11September serve to inspire a better  more just more peaceful world for all of us”. (Press releaseSG/SM/8376)We hope that reason will prevail over fear  prejudiceand hatred.We welcome President Bush's commitment toexplore fully the route of the Security Council infinding a way to draw Iraq towards a peacefulsettlement of the outstanding issues. We also welcomeIraq's unconditional agreement to the return of theUnited Nations inspectors. That demonstrates itsreadiness and full cooperation in the implementation ofthe relevant Security Council resolutions. It is  indeed an encouraging development. We must dedicateourselves to seeking a political solution within theframework of the United Nations. And the UnitedNations must act  and act very quickly  to put an end tothe acute crisis which threatens to engulf an entireregion and which could have an impact on the wholeworld. We all know the consequences of this crisis. Letus join together and work with determination to savethe region  which is already in turmoil  from furtherconflict.One of the gravest yet often overlooked threats toworld peace is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. TheRepublic of Djibouti agrees with the Secretary-Generalthat the route to peace in the Middle East was laid outdecades ago in Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973)  and  recently  in resolution 1397(2002)  which stipulated the conditions of land forpeace  an end to terror and to occupation and twoStates  Palestine and Israel  living side by side withinsecure and recognized borders. Unfortunately  thefocus has been shifted again by demands for aleadership change in the Palestinian Authority and for13political and security reforms  while simultaneouslyeasing Israel's obligation to return to the negotiatingtable. The so-called sequential approach has alwaysfailed. It is urgent to move forward on all the issues comprehensively and simultaneously.To the political impasse should be added theeconomic destruction that has resulted from theinsurmountable checkpoints  roadblocks  repeatedincursions and the demolition of buildings and supplynetworks. The Palestinian people are in danger; awhole nation is virtually living in a prison. There is agrowing  unprecedented humanitarian crisis  as stressedby a number of recent reports  describing in detail thelevels of malnutrition  the drop-off in childimmunization programmes  the increased risk ofcommunicable diseases and runaway  endemic poverty.We remain steadfast in our condemnation of theviolence and the killing of innocent civilians  whetherthey be Palestinians or Israelis. In this context  wewelcome the latest plan of the Quartet  which outlines athree-phase road map to a comprehensive finalsettlement within a three-year period ending in 2005.To complete the process of bringing peace to theMiddle East  Syria and Israel must reach an agreementon Israel's withdrawal to the borders of 1967.A decade ago  the United Nations Conference onClimate and Development  held at Rio in 1992  gave usAgenda 21  which contains pertinent recommendationsfor lessening our wasteful consumer habits  protectingthe atmosphere and the oceans  promoting sustainableagriculture and combating poverty. The subsequentthematic conferences further strengthened andbroadened those recommendations  which have led tothe promises set out in the Millennium Declaration particularly on alleviating endemic and severe poverty.The goals  targets  commitments and deadlines forreducing poverty provide a new  decisive impetus. Therecent World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg  made important and significantprogress on crucial issues facing humankind today.All those demonstrations of goodwill  however need to be backed by concrete action. Speaking onbehalf of the European Union during this GeneralAssembly debate  the Prime Minister of Denmarkexpressed that sentiment:“At Doha  Monterrey and Johannesburg  wereached consensus on what needs to be done. Butknowing what has to be done is not enough. Asworld leaders  we must see that it is done”.(A/57/PV.2)In an increasingly demanding world  more andmore references are made to good governance investment in human capital and economic freedom asconditions for developing countries to qualify fordevelopment assistance. For its part  Africa hasacknowledged to its partners the need to enhance thecontinent's responsibility in all areas of concern including peace  stability  democracy  human rights anddevelopment. Through the New Partnership forAfrica's Development  Africa has shown that it is ableto shoulder greater collective responsibility inresolving its conflicts and in its development. In return Africa keenly hopes that the financial constraints thathave seriously hindered development and humandignity will be duly taken into account by our partners.The issue of HIV/AIDS is one of the majorconcerns of our continent. More than 30 million peopleare infected in the world  and 75 per cent of those areAfricans. The impact on development is disastrous.Life expectancy has decreased in some countries.Remarks made by the Executive Director of the JointUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS are veryclear:“If people are not alive  if people are nothealthy — the people who are supposed to bringus sustainable development — then it won'thappen. AIDS is a major crisis of humanresources.”Based on the outcome of the peace andreconciliation conference held at Arta  Djibouti  oursubregional organization  the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development (IGAD)  is working toorganize a conference to bring together the nationaltransition Government and other parties in Somalia —the regional administrations  factions and groups thatopted to stay away from that historic meeting. Thefront-line States  Djibouti  Ethiopia and Kenya  weremandated by the Ninth IGAD Summit of Heads ofState and Government  held in January  to bring all ofthe components together with a view to completing theArta process and thus paving the way for theemergence of a broad-based Government. Much hasbeen accomplished  but it is fair to state that anenormous amount remains to be done.The Republic of Djibouti believes that a realisticroad map  consistent with current thinking is a capital14necessity. The majority view of the internationalcommunity — including the United Nations  theAfrican Union  the League of Arab States  theOrganization of the Islamic Conference  IGAD and theEuropean Union — is that the Arta peace processremains the most viable basis for peace and nationalreconciliation in Somalia. There has been a willingnessto complete  without preconditions  the Arta peace andreconciliation process. Without ambiguity  theinternational community has consistently called fordialogue involving the national transition Governmentand the other parties  in a spirit of mutual respect andtolerance  with a view to establishing an inclusiveGovernment in Somalia based on power sharingthrough a democratic process. Those are cardinalprinciples that should keep us on the right path. Wecannot permit ourselves to stray from them.Decisions related to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security lie with the SecurityCouncil  which  despite the exponential increase ofUnited Nations membership over the past threedecades  has singularly remained an unrepresentativebody. If confidence is to be placed in its decisions there must also be an expansion in both the permanentand the non-permanent member categories  giving bothdeveloped and developing countries the opportunity tobecome permanent members. The Working Groupcharged with studying that issue has thus far failed toarrive at a satisfactory conclusion  and we see no clearprospect of the impasse being broken soon. Moreobjectivity and clarity of vision are required in order tobring about that vital necessity.Over the past decades  the people of the Horn ofAfrica have had their share of difficulties andsuffering  and we are anxious to see peace development and a reduction in conflict. For its part my country  the Republic of Djibouti  is firmlyconvinced of the merit of good-neighbourly relations cooperation and the creation of opportunities for thebenefit of our peoples. We are resolutely committed towork hand in hand with our international partners ingeneral  and with our friends in the region in particular to resolve all outstanding issues that compromise trustand harmony."
"47",1922,"DMA",57,2002,"﻿The Commonwealth ofDominica joins other delegations in congratulating youon your election to chair the proceedings of the fifty-seventh session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly. We are confident that you will preside overthis Assembly with the efficiency and dedicationrequired to take us through the agenda of the fifty-seventh session.We also take this opportunity to extend to yourpredecessor our sincere appreciation for the excellentmanner in which he steered the work of the fifty-sixthsession of this General Assembly.One year ago we convened in a city reeling froma terrible tragedy which spurred the internationalcommunity to unite in the fight against internationalterrorism. The world's response to the events of 11September 2001 was one of total condemnation ofterrorism in all its forms and a firm undertaking touphold the principles of freedom and democracyenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.The United Nations Security Council was swiftand decisive in its adoption of a resolution focused onsuppressing the financing of terrorism and denyingterrorists any safe haven in which to operate. Sadly terrorism remains today one of the greatest threats tohuman security. The Commonwealth of Dominicatherefore once again reaffirms its commitment to thefight against international terrorism and to ensuringthat the channels for funding of terrorist-relatedactivities and international crime are permanentlydisabled.My Government is making every effort towardsthe successful implementation of United NationsSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) in spite oflimited human and financial resources. Legislativemeasures which have been put in place include anExchange of Information Act  which addresses some ofthe concerns of the international community asexpressed in resolution 1373 (2001). This Act waspassed in the Dominica Parliament in January 2002 while a bill for the suppression of financing ofterrorism will be tabled before Parliament shortly.My delegation wishes to take this opportunity toexpress its appreciation for the initiatives taken by theCounter-Terrorism Committee  the Commonwealth  theEuropean Union and other countries and organizationsto assist developing countries in their implementationof resolution 1373 (2001).The historic entry into force of the Rome Statuteof the International Criminal Court (ICC) takes us onestep further in the fight against impunity of war crimesand crimes against humanity. The Commonwealth ofDominica's accession to the Statute of the ICC inJanuary 2001 is indicative of our support for theestablishment of a permanent international court thatwill bring the perpetrators of the most seriousinternational crimes to justice. In this regard  the ICCmust seek to prevent or penalize terrorist-relatedcrimes which may be localized in action  but may havesevere global consequences.The international situation  notably developmentsin the world economy  has not been favourable to thegrowth prospects of small States such as theCommonwealth of Dominica  which remains a small open and largely agriculture-based economy  extremelyvulnerable to external economic shocks. While theevents of 11 September 2001 are behind us  theirreparable damage to the economies of smallCaribbean countries is still evident. Hardest hit was thetourism sector  one of the areas with the greatestpotential to contribute to Dominica's social andeconomic development.32The growth of our offshore financial sector another potential contributor to our economicdiversification  has been adversely affected by ourcountry's inclusion in the list of non-cooperativecountries and territories put out by the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'sFinancial Action Task Force. All attempts thus far tohave our country removed from that list have provedfutile  in spite of the implementation of the measuresnecessary to ensure best industry practices in thefinancial services sector.The Commonwealth of Dominica neverthelesscommits itself to the global combat against money-laundering and stands ready to cooperate with theinternational community in its anti-money-launderinginitiative. A number of new laws have been enacted byParliament to legislate its anti-money-launderingpolicies. The Commonwealth of Dominica has alsoestablished a Financial Intelligence Unit and a Money-Laundering Supervisory Authority to ensure that ourfinancial-services sector remains free from money-laundering.As I address you  my country is facing one of themost challenging periods in its history. The slowdownin the global economy  the impact of the events of 11September 2001 on an already deteriorating fiscalsituation  the continued difficulties of integrating intothe multilateral trading system in a globalized worldand the rapid decline in overseas developmentassistance have undoubtedly affected our economicperformance in an appallingly negative way.We have been left with no other option but topursue a stabilization and adjustment programme which  although approved by the InternationalMonetary Fund  has not succeeded in keepingdetractors  including the public service union  off thestreets.The success of this programme should lay thebasis for sustained higher growth output andemployment  as well as poverty reduction. Werecognize  however  the attendant costs ofimplementing this programme. The Dominican peoplehave been asked to make temporary  but heavysacrifices in order to place our country on the road torecovery.We wish to recognize  in this forum  the supportgiven in these difficult times to the Commonwealth ofDominica at the Caribbean regional level  and lookforward to the timely support of the internationalcommunity.Last year  as the world turned its attention to theevents of 11 September  the Secretary-Generalreminded us that none of the issues that faced us on 10September had become less urgent. Indeed  the UnitedNations calendar for the past year has been crowdedwith special conferences and summits  all convened toaddress problems and issues of global concern thataffect the everyday lives of the peoples of the UnitedNations. While it is true that those issues are currentand of interest to the smaller members of this body it isunfortunate that many of us do not have the capacity orwherewithal to ensure that they receive effectiverepresentation  not only at the conferences but  moresignificantly  in the preparatory committees thatprecede the conferences. It is no accident  therefore that most often the States that least benefit are thesmallest and least influential.The Second World Assembly on Ageing and thespecial session on children attempted to deal withissues which affect the most vulnerable members of oursocieties. The World Assembly concluded in April witha Plan of Action for implementation by theinternational community. In small countries like theCommonwealth of Dominica  this implementationmust  of necessity  include the recognition of olderpersons as the pillars of our societies — people whomake a significant contribution to our economicdevelopment.My Government has developed a national policyon ageing which seeks to ensure that older persons areprovided with protective care and given an opportunityto continue to participate in the development of ournation. A few weeks ago  we were privileged to hostthe tenth annual regional meeting of HelpAgeInternational — a happy coincidence  given that amongour population of 75 000  we have 22 centenarians. Iwant to make specific mention of the world's oldestliving person — a Dominican woman  Mrs. ElizabethIsrael  affectionately known as Ma Pampo — who isallegedly 127.Civil society organizations like HelpAge must berecognized for their vigorous attempts to deal withissues affecting older persons. As a family of nations we established set goals  strategies and actions inpursuit of a better life for children at the specialsession of the General Assembly on children. As a33signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child the Commonwealth of Dominica remains committed toensuring that children's rights are protected andrespected. Children are one of our most valuableresources.The Monterrey Conference on Financing forDevelopment was convened in March this year  andwas hailed as a “turning point in the approach todevelopment cooperation” by the internationalcommunity. It was widely acknowledged at Monterreythat  in order for development assistance to beeffective  both the donors and the recipients had toshare the same goals of sustainable development andthe alleviation and eventual eradication of poverty.We applaud the commitment expressed by themajor donor Governments to the Monterrey Consensus.What we desire  however  is an equitable distributionof the increased official development assistance fundspledged by the heads of State or Government of theEuropean Union in March 2002. The same can be saidof the “new compact for global development” proposedby President George W. Bush on 14 March 2002  bywhich the United States pledged to increase its coreassistance to developing countries by 50 per cent overthe next three years.We are still confident that global conferences canwork  because it has been proved that they serve asforums where new proposals can be debated andconsensus sought on topical issues. At the recentlyconcluded Johannesburg Summit  world Governmentsagreed to halve by 2015 the number of people lackingclean water and basic sanitation.My Government was particularly pleased that atthe conclusion of the Johannesburg Summit the richercountries stated their willingness to reach anagreement  by January 2005  within the World TradeOrganization  for “substantial improvements in marketaccess” for food exports from developing countries.The Johannesburg Summit underlined thenecessary linkage between environmental protectionand natural resources management and the issues ofpoverty  underdevelopment and social justice. TheSummit demonstrated the interdependence of social environmental and economic factors  which must workin unison if long-term sustainable development is to beachieved. Empirical evidence exists to show that poorand weak national economies impact negatively on theenvironment  while environmental degradation and theover-utilization of natural resources result in decliningeconomies and impoverished communities.The Government of Dominica remains fullycommitted to Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programmeof Action for Small Island Developing States. Wereiterate our unwavering support for the JohannesburgPlan of Action and urge all Member States to makegood on their commitments for the successfulimplementation of all sustainable developmentconventions.The increase in levels of official developmentassistance  to which I alluded earlier  is essential whenviewed in the context of the implementation ofdevelopment strategies by small island developingStates. It is recognized that the small  open economiesof these small States require effective means  includingfinancial resources  to counteract the negative effectsof globalization and trade liberalization and to fostersustainable development.The Commonwealth of Dominica is acutely awareof the magnitude of the challenges facing our pursuit ofsustainable development. Ours is a country with ahistory of consistently seeking a national developmentpath guided by sustainable development. An integrateddevelopment plan  undertaken with the participation ofa diversity of stakeholders and sectors  will shortly becompleted and will provide us with a framework withinwhich we can address physical  economic and socialvulnerabilities in an integrated manner.At this time  my Government wishes to place onrecord its appreciation of the continued commitment ofthe Republic of China on Taiwan to the social economic and infrastructural development of small vulnerable economies very much like its own. As thefourteenth largest economy in the world  the Republicof China on Taiwan has demonstrated the benefits ofhaving a global perspective on development. Wewelcomed the decision of the World TradeOrganization  in November 2001  to admit the Republicof China on Taiwan as a full member of thatorganization. We look forward to a similar occasionwhen the Republic of China on Taiwan will take itsplace in these halls as a full member of the UnitedNations family.The Commonwealth of Dominica joins otherdelegations in congratulating the African nations fortwo important developments. First  the transformationof the Organization of African Unity into the African34Union  which we are confident will be a stronginstitution committed to the promotion of peace andstability  democracy and human rights  cooperation development  prosperity and human dignity. Second we have the programme for socio-economicrevitalization of the African continent  the NewPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). TheUnited Nations has a central role to play in ensuringthe success of this bold initiative of the African Statesto eradicate poverty and underdevelopment. These twodevelopment provide great examples that ourCaribbean region can emulate.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate the resolve ofthe Millennium Declaration that“the central challenge we face today is to ensurethat globalization becomes a positive force for allthe world's people.” (A/54/2000  para. 5)We must ensure  through the global and regionalprogrammes  that globalization truly contributes tosustainable development and prosperity for all. Wewish the 57th General Assembly every success inadvancing the goals of peace  democracy  prosperityand sustainable development."
"48",1966,"DNK",57,2002,"﻿On behalf of theEuropean Union  I am honoured to address the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session.A year ago today  the world woke up to a terriblenew reality; but it was also a wake-up call for us to joinforces and present a solid front against the perpetratorsof terror  the enemies of freedom. Not so far from here at the heart of New York's pulsating businesscommunity  the twin towers used to stand  representingthe pride of all New Yorkers in their city. But now  theyhave been replaced by a gaping hole  a memento of thatfateful September day when terror reared its ugly headand  for a while  the very pulse of this city seemed tostop. For on that day  terror came to America  leavingin its wake death and destruction and thousands uponthousands of sorrowing mourners.It was the moment which marked the division ofour world into civilized nations and those that useterror as their weapon; but it was also the day whichsaw us take a stand against evil. It was the day whenwe decided to stand shoulder to shoulder in aworldwide coalition against these men of terror andtheir cowardly acts.And  when the call for action came  it was here within these walls at the United Nations  that we met togive each other renewed hope and confidence. It was asnatural as it was necessary  because the attack wasdirected against the very foundation of thisOrganization  planned by cowards in their lairsconspiring against world peace and security  launchedby fanatics violating every basic law of humanity  andsupported by tyranny oppressing liberty and equality.For make no mistake  these acts of terrorism have notweakened us; they have only served to strengthen ourresolve to actively seek security and prosperity for allconsistent with the United Nations Charter andinternational law. And  from the outset  the UnitedNations has played a crucial role in the fight againstterrorism.On our part in the European Union  there couldbe no hesitation. Our way was and is clear. We fullysupport the initiatives of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee because we will never allow28terror and fear to obscure freedom and democracy. TheEuropean Union therefore intends actively to assistother nations in implementing Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001). The European Union remainscommitted to finalizing and adopting thecomprehensive convention against terrorism and wetherefore strongly urge all Member States to join andimplement the 12 United Nations conventions onterrorism.The key role played by the United Nations in thefight against terrorism is a reminder of the fact that theUnited Nations itself was born out of hope founded onthe ashes of the Second World War — a war whichdefeated tyranny and terror. With the adoption of theMillennium Declaration  the United Nations has beengiven renewed impetus to deal globally with conflictprevention  crisis management  humanitarianassistance  post-conflict rehabilitation anddevelopment  and disarmament and arms control. In thecomplicated area of peacemaking  the United Nationsand the European Union work tirelessly to findsolutions in the Middle East through the efforts of theQuartet and in finding a permanent settlement onCyprus consistent with the relevant Security Councilresolutions. The European Union is a major partner inthe rebuilding of a new Afghanistan freed from terror.In the Middle East  Iraq remains a major sourceof concern with regard to weapons of mass destruction as President Bush emphasised in his importantstatement this morning. Iraq must grant unconditionaland unimpeded access for the weapons inspectors toIraq and the required cooperation from its authorities tothe inspectors. Iraq is in breach of several resolutionsof the Security Council on its disarmament obligations.These obligations must be complied with immediately.The European Union is determined to support furtherefforts of the United Nations to that end. We agree withthe United States that this matter should urgently bedealt with by the Security Council and we agree withthe Secretary-General that  if Iraq's defiance continues the Security Council must face up to itsresponsibilities.The European Union  conscious of its obligations remains strongly engaged in United Nations-mandatedoperations throughout the world  from holding in checkthe civil war in Sierra Leone to building a secure prosperous and democratic Kosovo. We also stronglysupport the initiatives to strengthen the United Nationsfuture peacekeeping capacity. We owe it to our armedforces to ensure an efficient and robust framework forfuture operations.But we must not forget that at the heart of allthese conflicts are human beings  who are sometimesstruggling to achieve what we take for granted. Forhuman rights are fundamental to the lives and dignityof all human beings. The primary  fundamental andessential accomplishment of the United Nations willone day be the full enjoyment of all human rights byeveryone everywhere: the right of each individual tofeel that life  body and property are hers or his aloneand to feel safe and secure; the right of each individualto face authorities without fear of injustice orharassment; and the right of each individual to learnthat people can speak up for themselves withconfidence and without having to fear theconsequences.Human rights are also fundamental to humanprosperity and development. The European Uniontherefore strongly supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to integrate human rights into all UnitedNations activities.Sadly  cruelty toward the defenceless  violence maltreatment and torture remain widespread. TheEuropean Union strongly supports the adoption of thedraft optional protocol to the United NationsConvention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhumanand Degrading Treatment or Punishment.The European Union also advocates universalabolition of the death penalty. No State should grantitself the right to take life. Where the death penalty stillexists  we call for its use to be progressively restricted.We would like to see all nations introduce amoratorium on this form of punishment and eventually  to end it altogether  so that it will become athing of the past.Until women are in possession of all humanrights and are able to take charge of their lives and toachieve their full potential  sustainable developmentwill remain but a dream. The European Union remainscommitted to fighting all forms of discrimination andviolence against women  including murder andmutilation through a misguided sense of honour. By thesame token  we vigorously pursue the global fightagainst racism  discrimination and intolerance. Thesedeplorable attitudes and actions are regrettably stillpart of everyday life throughout the world. They do notbelong here at the doorstep of the new millennium.29People do not need revenge; they want justice.They do not wish for impunity; they wantaccountability. That is what the International CriminalCourt (ICC) is about. We now have a permanentinternational court that can bring those accused of warcrimes and other perpetrators of the most seriouscrimes of international concern to trial. The EuropeanUnion supports the ICC as an important historicmilestone. It reflects a new level of internationalcooperation. We are confident that the ICC willcontribute to strengthening respect for internationalhumanitarian law and human rights. The EuropeanUnion expresses its strong hope that countries that atpresent have reservations about the Statute will join assoon as possible. We believe that the Court will proveto be an effective  competent and fair legal instrument.Ridding the world of persistent poverty remainsthe greatest global challenge of all. We have achievedsignificant results in the fight against poverty andmisery  but the world community still has far to go ifwe are to meet the goals of the MillenniumDeclaration.For many countries  the United Nations is firstand foremost about combating poverty. How can weassure everyone access to the essentials of life? Thenext meal  medicine and health care to survive andaccess to basic education: these are the promisescontained in the Millennium Declaration  and we mustnot let the world down.Aid alone will not eliminate poverty. We knowthat. Developing countries can take their cue fromAfrican leaders  who have taken an impressive leadwith the New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD). This year has seen many decisive stepstaken within the fields of trade and development finance and sustainable development. At Doha Monterrey and Johannesburg  we reached consensus onwhat needs to be done. But knowing what has to bedone is not enough. As world leaders  we must see thatit is done.The European Union played a key role inreaching this consensus and is therefore committed tothis new agenda. We have decided to further open ourmarkets to exports from the least developed countries.We hope that others will follow the same path.Translating policies on poverty eradication intosustainable development requires strong political willand true partnership in development. A major challengenow will be to turn the Monterrey Consensus and theoutcome of Johannesburg into reality. The EuropeanUnion proposes that the United Nations system monitorimplementation of the Johannesburg targets andagenda. These and other important United Nationspolicy issues are spelled out in the European Unionposition paper.On behalf of the European Union  I am happy towelcome the decisions of Switzerland and East Timorto join the United Nations. Two nations — one old andone new  one in the North and one in the South: theyreflect the multitude and the diversity of the UnitedNations.At the special session of the General Assemblyon children  young people from all over the worldillustrated their dream of a world of peace and unityusing all the colours of the flags of the Members of theUnited Nations.But we should not content ourselves with adream. From the war against international terrorism through the quest for justice  to the relentless fightagainst poverty  we need a strong and efficient UnitedNations. The Declaration on the Rights of the Childsays that “mankind owes to the child the best it has togive” (resolution 1386 (XIV)  preamble). What bettergift can we give children than unity among ournations?Let us seize the moment and take another steptowards a true United Nations  united in word and indeed."
"49",2011,"DOM",57,2002,"﻿I wish to extend ourcongratulations to Mr. Jan Kavan on his election tolead the work of the General Assembly. We areconfident that his leadership will bring greater honourto the United Nations  to his country and to himself.We would also like to congratulate his predecessor  Mr.14Han Seung-soo  for his excellent work during theprevious session.We would also like to express our solidarity withSecretary-General Kofi Annan in his defence of thewill of the many in the face of any event that placesworld peace at risk.We also wish to welcome the SwissConfederation and East Timor as they take their placesin the Organization.On behalf of the people and the Government ofthe Dominican Republic  I would like once again toreiterate the profound faith that the Dominican peoplehave in the principles on which the universal missionof the United Nations is based. The ideas andambitions that sparked the Second World War broughthumanity close to losing all hope for peaceful co-existence. Political fanaticism  intransigent nationalismand all sorts of prejudices cast their shadow overleaders and over a great part of the world  leading to anominous undertaking whose ideological manifestationgreatly endangered the freedom and cultural diversityof humankind.Luckily for all  reason prevailed. In order to makethat victory a lasting one  and in order to ensure thathumankind would maintain a steady and clear pathtowards peace  the nations who fought for freedomrecognized the need to create a body to watch over thevalues that would improve international behaviour.These were the reasons for both the emergence of theUnited Nations and for enshrining in the Charter theobjectives of peace  justice  the rejection of aggressionand the resolution of controversies through peacefulmeans and in accordance with international law.In other words  it was very clearly set out that theOrganization would seek to use every peaceful meansto resolve conflicts between peoples or States. It wasalso clearly specified that the use of force to maintainor restore peace and international security had to be theresult of a unanimous decision of the permanentmembers of the Security Council. Over five decadeshave passed since the establishment of theOrganization  and the events and changes experiencedby the world in that time have been innumerable.Many bloody conflicts in the Middle East  Asiaand Africa have challenged the authority of the UnitedNations. Many unilateral actions have violated theOrganization's legal system and threatened the balanceof the world. Nevertheless  despite every provocationand all the instances of non-compliance with theresolutions of its highest bodies  the Organization hasclearly made its mark by asserting the need to respectthe international norms and laws governing thebehaviour of its members. Peace  and even the survivalof mankind itself  owe a great deal to the achievementsof the United Nations.Unfortunately  threats to universal peace continueto cast their shadow over the world today. The date of11 September 2001 is an alarming example of thescope and capability of the enemies of peace. We willnever be able to forget the perversity of those actions their criminal character or the affront they tried toinflict upon this great nation. We understand perfectlywell that  in the face of an aggression of this nature  thespontaneous reaction may be that of claiminglegitimate self-defence. However  we should agree thatsuch a response has moral limitations and conditionsembodied in the principles that rule the rights of peopleand in those that form the bedrock of this Organization.The Dominican Government has been signing allresolutions  agreements and conventions againstterrorism. The Dominican Government has supportedSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001)  which createdthe Counter-Terrorism Committee  and is promotingthe work to draft a comprehensive convention againstinternational terrorism. However  our purpose infighting this scourge and our solidarity with the nationsthat have been and are its victims must be focused beyond any contingency  on the eradication of thecauses that stimulate and provoke the depravation ofthe human condition that is expressed in acts of terror.With regard to the right to confront terrorismdirectly  we must be aware that unilateral actionrepresents a defeat of our capacity to reach agreements.It is only logical that it is our responsibility to do sowith all the authority that this Organization grantsthrough its multilateral nature. This is true because theuse of force can be justified only when all means underthe Charter of United Nations available to the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council to assess the existenceof a real threat to world peace have been exhausted.In his report of 13 April 1998 concerning theissue of peace in Africa  the Secretary-General set forthideas which must serve as a guide on the Iraqisituation. Among other ideas  Kofi Annan stated:15“For the United Nations there is no highergoal  no deeper commitment and no greaterambition than preventing armed conflict. Theprevention of conflict begins and ends with thepromotion of human security and humandevelopment.” (A/52/871  para. 2)It is obvious that we are not the only ones to thinkthat  in the face of market globalization processes  culturalexchanges  technologies and communications  it hasbecome imperative to resume on the path laid down atthe Millennium Summit in order to correct the imbalancesand to halt the growing total marginalization of largesectors of the world population. Allow me to quote aparagraph from the Millennium Declaration as areminder of our priorities:“We believe that the central challenge weface today is to ensure that globalization becomesa positive force for all the world's people. Forwhile globalization offers great opportunities  atpresent its benefits are very unevenly shared while its costs are unevenly distributed. Werecognize that developing countries and countrieswith economies in transition face specialdifficulties in responding to this centralchallenge.” (resolution 55/2  para. 5)Moreover  the Millennium Summit prioritizedissues such as poverty  illiteracy  illness  genderinequality and environmental depletion as causes thatconspire decisively against peace and universalcoexistence. These troubling situations beg thequestion: How much have we done at the national andinternational levels to eliminate the obstacles thathinder the growth of the developing countries?Right from its assumption of power in August2000  the Government of the Dominican Republic headed by agronomist Hipólito Mej'a  has taken aseries of measures aimed at adapting legislation in bothpublic and private institutions to the demands of theunavoidable globalization process. With respect tosocial reform  the Dominican Government haslaunched a programme to reduce poverty and hasincreased its support in the fight against illiteracy. Thecreation of ministries of women and the environmentare also significant initiatives in view of the lack ofattention from which these sectors of societytraditionally suffered.We know that other countries have made similarchanges  but the truth of the matter is that  as a whole global statistics leave little room for optimism whencompared to those relating to the great majority ofdeveloping countries. Unfortunately  at the globallevel  we cannot say that developed countries havemanifested any understanding of or solidarity towardsthese issues in positive terms. The opportunitiesoffered by the developed countries for developingcountries to participate in the globalization processthrough cooperation leading to harmonious  gradualand equitable adaptation leave much to be desired.Within this sombre picture  the United Nations hasto act decisively in favour of the development of nationsunjustifiably constrained by protectionism and subsidies which create barriers that hinder competition on equalterms and which  consequently  negate free trade.Year after year  speaker after speaker  we speak inthis solemn Hall about the mandate — also ratified atthe Millennium Summit — to proceed with decisivereforms in the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly. However  a sort of indifference or adversepurport postpones or paralyses the opportunity toactually undertake such reform. If the universalconscience is to enjoy genuine representation  thereform of such bodies is imperative. Thus  thisOrganization needs its multilateral role to become thetrue expression of the political composition acquiredby the world over the past 57 years.On behalf of the Dominican Government  wewish to express our satisfaction for the decision takenby the Organization of American States regardingHaiti. Indeed  through its resolution 822 of 4September 2002  entitled “Support for strengtheningdemocracy in Haiti”  that regional organization decidedto support the regularization of economic cooperationbetween the Haitian Government and internationalfinancial institutions. Following the instructions of thePresident of the Dominican Republic  we appeal to theconscience of the United Nations to proceed in thesame manner and to extend its support in reachingthose nations capable of generous cooperation with oursister nation.I wish to take this opportunity to share the mostrecent decisions concerning the International Researchand Training Institute for the Advancement of Women headquartered in the Dominican Republic  which is one ofthe few United Nations bodies located in a developingcountry and the only one working on women's researchand training. On 19 December 2001  by resolution1656/125  the General Assembly decided to create aworking group with the mandate to makerecommendations on the future work of the Institute. Thatworking group met eight times in July and August 2002.The Dominican Republic is confident that this sessionof the General Assembly will accept the workinggroup's recommendations and that the Institute willsoon be able to continue to fulfil its mandate.In conclusion  I must recall that  at the beginningof my statement  I reaffirmed the faith of the Dominicanpeople and Government in the mission of the UnitedNations. This Organization is more necessary today thanever before  at a time when the world is shrinking andwhen we increasingly need more than one interlocutorto which we can turn when faced with issues that couldprovoke violence and war. In other words  today morethan ever all nations aspire to having an Organizationthat  through its traditional mandate and its universalscope  can strike a balance among all States for thebenefit of genuine democratic security."
"50",2058,"DZA",57,2002,"﻿Let meat the outset  on behalf of the Algerian delegation congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President ofthe current session of the General Assembly. This is atribute to your personal qualities and to your country with which my own has good relations of friendshipand cooperation.I should like also to congratulate Switzerland onits admission to full membership in our Organization. Iam sure that that country  so deeply attached toneutrality in international affairs  will offer a valuablecontribution to our common quest for world peace  at atime when this peace is so seriously threatened  interalia by international terrorism. I therefore welcome theSwiss delegation to the Assembly and wish it everysuccess in its work here with us.Our Assembly will also shortly be admitting tofull membership in the United Nations the new State ofTimor-Leste. We welcome its brand-new independence.The Timorese people have freely chosen  through theexercise of their right to self-determination  to be themasters of their own fate. We congratulate them onceagain for having stood firm  and we welcome them andwish them a future of progress  prosperity and peace.It has been two years now since the historicMillennium Declaration was adopted. In offering acollective response  in a spirit of solidarity  to thechallenges facing the world in the areas of peace security and the eradication of poverty  theinternational community took a responsible approach tothe situation that  given the subsequent events thatdisrupted and shook the world  make that Declarationseem to have foreshadowed the present.The tragic events of 11 September 2001  whichwe commemorated just a few days ago  highlighted theneed for a collective response to this global threat ofterrorism. For a decade  Algeria has had to face alonethis scourge of the modern age. We are glad that thereis now greater awareness of this phenomenon withinthe international community and of the measures thatneed to be taken to address it.2Algeria participated in the efforts to conclude theconventions to combat terrorism adopted within thevarious regional African  Arab and Islamicorganizations of which Algeria is a member. Thoseconventions made a significant contribution tostrengthening the international legal frameworkessential for any action for effective internationalcooperation in combating terrorism.We believe that it is a matter of urgency to adopta comprehensive convention on combating terrorism which would provide a normative framework forbringing together the various cooperation agreementsin the anti-terrorist struggle. We must go beyond ourdifferences in respect of how we define terrorism inseeking one acceptable to all  avoiding ambiguities thatwe all condemn.More specifically  we reject any associationbetween Islam and terrorist activities. We cannotequate terrorism with the fight by people who aredeprived of their rights  an unequal fight that theyare waging with all the resources and weaponsavailable to them.Because of the excesses committed by the Israelioccupiers  the international community has defined theconditions necessary to bring back a just and lastingpeace in Palestine and in the Middle East. Theconditions include the rejection of violence  theresumption of negotiations based on the principle ofland for peace  and  a cardinal point theconfirmation of the right of the Palestinian people toestablish a State within recognized and secure borders and its corollary  two States  Palestinian andIsraeli  living in peace  side by side.The Beirut Arab initiative offered the outline forsuch a settlement  based on international law and theprinciple of land for peace.That Arab initiative was welcomed by the UnitedNations and the co-sponsors of the peace process  andit breathed new life into a peace process that had beenlanguishing. Algeria  today as in the past  stands sideby side with the Palestinian people in their exemplarystruggle for freedom and dignity  which can succeedonly when the legitimate national rights of thePalestinian people are recognized  including its right tothe establishment of an independent State  with Al-Quds as its capital  and a complete Israeli withdrawalfrom all Arab territories occupied since 1967. That isthe only way to bring peace  stability and security backto the sensitive region of the Middle East.In that same region  in Iraq  positivedevelopments have just occurred which give groundsfor hope that the logic of war will finally be replacedby the logic of peace. In agreeing to the return to itsterritory of United Nations inspectors  Iraq hasdemonstrated that it is committed to cooperating withthe international community so that there can bedefinitive closure on the question of weapons of massdestruction. That was a courageous decision by theIraqi Government  which must logically lead to thedefinitive lifting of sanctions  which have hurt the Iraqipeople so badly  and to bringing back peace andsecurity to that country and to the region as a whole  instrict respect of the sovereignty and unity of the Iraqipeople and of the territorial integrity of its nationalterritory.Close by Algeria  in Western Sahara  27 yearsafter the withdrawal of the former colonial Power  theSahrawi people are still demanding their inalienableright to self-determination  pursuant to GeneralAssembly resolution 1514 (XV) and to the resolutionsthat the General Assembly has been adopting andconfirming year after year  since it called in 1966 forthe decolonization of the territory and for self-determination for the people through a referendum.The international community cannot remainindifferent to the fate of that people  nor can it acceptthat the full implementation of the Settlement Plan andof the Huston agreements be postponed time and again.Algeria  a neighbour to the two brotherly peoplesof Morocco and Western Sahara  will continue to do itsutmost in the service of international peace and ofstability and unity in the subregion. Algeria has fullysupported the efforts made by the Secretary-Generaland his Personal Envoy  and we have made asignificant contribution to the settlement of theconflict. The United Nations  and the SecurityCouncil in particular  is dealing with the issue ofWestern Sahara. Algeria hopes that its relationshipswith its neighbours will not be jeopardized by thisdispute and that the Arab Maghreb Union will be ableto resume its activities and develop fruitful cooperationwith all the countries in the region.This session is taking place at a time whenglobalization is accelerating and an information andcommunication technologies revolution is under way.3Questions continue to arise about the benefits andchallenges of this process and the risks ofmarginalization and exclusion that it poses for thedeveloping countries  particularly in Africa. Thissession is of particular significance because it is takingplace in the immediate aftermath of the InternationalConference on Financing for Development and theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development  twoevents that could prove decisive for the future ofinternational cooperation for sustainable  balanced andequitable development.While the process that was launched at Monterreyidentified how financing is to be mobilized andfinancial and technical cooperation for developmentstrengthened  the Johannesburg Summit focused on thepriority areas of combating poverty and ensuringsustainable development and international cooperation.The right to development must be the main focusof our concern and efforts to strengthen internationalcooperation through various innovative partnershipsbetween the North and the South  based on the sharingof responsibilities and benefits. In this connection  Iwould like to mention the signing this year of theAssociation Agreement between Algeria and theEuropean Union. That Agreement will provide thefoundation for launching a genuine  mutually beneficialpartnership.Problems relating to internationalizing foreigndirect investment flows as much as possible significantly increasing official developmentassistance  managing the debt burden  opening marketsto the products of the South and restructuring theinternational financial institutions to allow for greaterparticipation by developing countries clearly remainour major concerns  and we need to find solutions tothem quickly.Given the serious crises that are convulsing theworld  the establishment of a more equitableinternational economic and trade order is becomingincreasingly important  and will require greaterpolitical will on the part of the internationalcommunity.The outcome of the most recent World TradeOrganization meeting at Doha provided us with anopportunity to set up a more open and transparentmultilateral trading system to enable developingcountries to increase their share of international trade.I would also like to refer to the bilateral andmultilateral initiatives that have been undertaken toassist developing countries  in particular the leastdeveloped among them. I hope that such initiatives willbe followed up with other specific steps that can givereal meaning to international solidarity and to sustainedefforts aimed at building a more humanistic world  freefrom the seeds of instability and violence.The world is changing very quickly  resulting inenormous uncertainty about the future of the humanrace. We note the tendency  in the light of suchdangers  to move towards international solidarity  notonly in the area of combating terrorism  but also infighting poverty and preserving the environment. Theimportance of the role played by the United Nations infinding solutions to the problems facing all of ourpeoples is becoming increasingly clear. In a world atrisk  this Organization is  indeed  irreplaceable because it symbolizes our common commitment tofight for the survival of humankind.The achievements of the United Nations areimpressive in the areas of promoting peace andsecurity  economic cooperation  social progress humanitarian activities and the development ofinternational law. The fact that such achievements havebeen made despite difficulties and inadequate resourcesis an indication of what the system would be capable ofwere it fully supported by all Member States.Efforts to streamline United Nations activities improve system-wide coordination and ensurecoherence in its actions augur well for theenhancement  greater credibility and effectiveness ofthe Organization.I should like to pay tribute to the leadership of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  in thisundertaking  which will require a greater commitmenton the part of States as well as the provision of moreresources.Strengthening the credibility and effectiveness ofthe United Nations will also require structural reformso as to enable it to better reflect the new face ofinternational society and deal with all of the challengesfacing humankind.In this new millennium  the world will not be ableto manage without the United Nations. AnOrganization that is in tune with the requirements ofchange in the world today is an indispensable tool in4helping us to build peace and comprehensivesustainable development."
"51",2105,"ECU",57,2002,"﻿Many of the heads of State that have preceded me atthis rostrum have been eloquent in expressing theiropen condemnation of terrorism  their prescriptions forthe eradication of extreme poverty  their vision for anew international order that will ensure peace andsecurity in the world and their reservations about aglobalization process that  if poorly understood  will inthe end make the gap between rich and poorunbridgeable.We want to stress above all the urgent need totake action and to begin to commit new and greaterfinancial resources to development. We muststrengthen our common bond and work together to tryto find solutions to the problems that affect us all.We  the poor countries  are asked to practiseausterity and fiscal discipline  respect the rules of the2free market and free trade and cooperate in the fightagainst the scourges that afflict humankind. When wetry to obtain access to the major markets for our goods however  the door is slammed shut. We are asked to becompetitive  but when we take the fruits of our labourto the market  subsidies amounting to millions ofdollars are placed in our way  making it impossible forus to even hope to compete.We are asked to participate in the fight againstdrug trafficking  but we have not been given theresources promised us to enable us to carry out ouraction plans.When we try to negotiate in a serious and creativeway with international lending agencies  attempts aremade to impose terms on us — terms that  if accepted would dangerously weaken our young and sometimesfragile democracies.People don't understand: our peoples  in theirpoverty  are quite perceptive  but they still cannotunderstand how they can benefit from a globalizationprocess that may never knock at their doors.We  the leaders of the developing countries  areseverely criticized when  upon our return from summitsand forums  we have only meagre results to show  andwhen the resolve to provide support and cooperation isweakened because of the actions of a few with respectto a consensus declaration.I want to be very clear and simple in expressingmy thoughts in this universal forum: hypocrisy inequity  injustice  increased poverty and failure to takeaction  among other ills  are the main reasons forbreaches of the peace. They create a framework inwhich violence  sectarian extremism andmisunderstanding find fertile ground.The developed world has found new anddiscriminatory methods — in financial  social andethical terms — of categorizing our countries. Someare willing to perpetuate this perverse way ofcategorizing us on the basis of criteria laid down bythose that have more than we do. We are criticized fora lack of transparency and for some alleged lack ofrespect for the law  while enormous losses are piling upowing to corruption. Could it be that the veryfoundations of the capital system have been seriouslydamaged by the scandals that have taken place in thewealthier and more powerful nations?Our emigrants are discriminated against  andsome forget how the most prosperous nations managedto create their identities through the mixing of races orby opening their arms to those yearning for progressand freedom. Developed countries demand thestrengthening of our institutions and they get quitelyrical in their support for democratic processes  whichoften take forms that lead only to instability. We mustbreak paradigms  and we must do it now. We must notpersist in simplifying  relying on a purely economicvocabulary  all the benefits of a globalization processthat is still not understood by all  nor assimilated ineach of its components.We speak of free flows of capitals  but theseflows only take the form of transfers of investments inthe Northern Hemisphere. We countries in the SouthernHemisphere have typically received these same capitalsin the form of expensive loans  whose heavy burden ithas been impossible to alleviate over time.When the North looks to the South  it sees it withpaternalistic and patronizing eyes. The widelypublicized equity in the terms of exchange is onlyvisible in statements  manuals and textbooks ofdeveloped countries. What we need is a new globalethic  one that repudiates terrorism but helps  with thesame strength and resolve  give substance to ourcreative efforts to eradicate poverty  a poverty thatthreatens the most basic principles of human dignity.When food is lacking  when there is no health oreducation  and when the survival instinct itself islimited  very little or nothing can be done to pursuevalues and ideals cherished by any developed society.My country condemns terrorism. My governmentsupports every effort to eradicate it  but Ecuador alsodemands the creation of a new coalition and a neworder to fight against poverty.This is a new century  a century of solidarity andhope. But we must also make this century a century ofrespect on the part of all nations for the principles thatgovern international law. Yes  it is a new century  acentury in which all activities that violate the sanctityof human life are condemned and prosecuted. There isno justification whatsoever for taking the lives ofinnocent persons. We must work with all forcesavailable  together under the law  to fight this scourge.This is also a century of changes of attitudes andof proposals  a time in which we must resolvedefinitively the problem of the debt of the poorest3countries towards the developed countries. It must be atime of opportunity to build a fairer world  a world ofsolidarity.As a global citizen  I am concerned that thecommitment to ensure the very existence of the planetis not shared equitably by all. Everything is demandedof those of us who have great diversity and renewableresources  but  in return  we are denied the financialtools to seek alternative resources for a developmentnot entailing the destruction of our natural resources  asif this commitment to the environment should fall onour shoulders alone. We must fight to improve thequality of life on earth. But the beneficiaries of thisstruggle must be every man and woman on earth  andnot only those with the good fortune to have been bornin the North.Ecuador  which I am honoured to represent in thisAssembly  is a country committed to the most noblecauses of the international community. No effort willbe spared to enable our people to reach a humansociety in which men  women and children  withoutdistinction  without exclusion  can develop fully andflourish.Ecuador wants to be an ethical model that looksto the future. We wish to see the voice of reason heardin every global forum. We want to create a world offreedom  a more just and united society. We would like from the centre of the two hemispheres  to be a bridgeuniting North and South  two regions that should walktogether towards development and not be separated bygeographic conventions.Thank you so much  distinguished delegates  forthis extraordinary opportunity to address the worldcommunity. Thank you for your continuing efforts tomake the United Nations the highest forum ofinternational debate. My country and my Governmentview this body as the highest forum for debate and forthe settlement of those problems that constantly affecthumankind."
"52",2150,"EGY",57,2002,"﻿Iwould like to begin by extending our sincerecongratulations to you  Sir  both personally and as arepresentative of the Czech Republic  on your electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I am confident that  at this importantjuncture of developing collective global action  youwill steer the work of this session with your recognizedability and wisdom  stemming from your country'slong experience in confronting aggression and thehorrors it brings.I would also like to take this opportunity to paytribute to your predecessor  our friend Han Seung-soo and to his country  the Republic of Korea  whosepositive and effective role led to results that we aspireto consolidate.I cannot fail to express our deep appreciation toSecretary-General Kofi Annan  who for the past sixyears has contributed his experience  wisdom andperseverance to reasserting the standing of theOrganization and the effectiveness of its role  and tostrengthening the principles upon which the Charterwas founded. He did all of that despite the inherentobstacles that were placed before him  eitherdeliberately or unwittingly  by those ignorant of thekey role of the United Nations in providing victors andvanquished alike an opportunity to benefit from thedevelopments of the age and to achieve the hopes andaspiration of their peoples to a world that is safer andmore just for all. I wish to pay further tribute to theSecretary-General for the very courageous statement hemade yesterday before the Assembly  a statement inwhich he set out his very clear vision in addressing andresolving the world's problems.On behalf of Egypt  I would also like to welcomeSwitzerland as the most recent member of the UnitedNations family. We look forward to its activeparticipation in the work of the Organization  alongwith that of Timor-Leste  which will soon accede tomembership.The current session has been convened one yearafter the horrific tragedy that befell the United Sates on11 September 2001. We reiterate our condolences tothe United States. We also emphasize the sense of losswe share with the families of the victims  and we wishthe injured a speedy recovery. We hope that this strongnation will overcome its ordeal and look towards afuture of cooperation with the rest of the world  afuture forged by all of us for the benefit of all theinhabitants of the planet  regardless of their race orreligion  without discrimination  intolerance or bias.Egypt has stood by the United States throughout thisdifficult ordeal  whose target was not only a friendlycountry but also the values and principles to which weall adhere and which relate to respect for humankindand its right to life and to choosing to build rather thanto destroy as the basis for joint action. In that regard  Iwould like to briefly make the following points.First  notwithstanding the gravity of the tragicevents that took place on that sad day  the world neitherbegan nor ended on 11 September. Many peoples haveknown terrorism before. They have suffered from itand have resisted it  sometimes alone  in the faceof hardship and even unjustified criticism. What is newis that the heinous crime of 11 September hasgenerated an unprecedented wave of constructiveinternational solidarity. It has confirmed what we havebeen stating all along: that terrorism is a globalphenomenon and that it is not associated with anyparticular country  continent  race or religion. It is anexpression of a propensity for evil that remainsdormant until the opportunity presents itself  eitherfrom within or due to prevailing circumstances  for itto awaken and wreak havoc. Thus  it is important torepeat the call that President Mubarak has been makingfor a number of years; for the convening of aninternational conference in which participating nationswould shoulder their responsibility to confrontterrorism. That would lend authority to theoverwhelming wave of solidarity extended to theUnited States in its hour of grief and agony.Secondly  the fight against terrorism should notbe the lens through which the world views every issueand every problem. Terrorism is one of the evilphenomena of the world  but it should not cause us toforget the evils of poverty  disease  occupation  thedenial of individual and national rights or thehumiliation of human beings and the destruction oftheir livelihood by means of bombs or any other6similarly harmful means. Terrorism has roots andcauses  but not justifications. I believe that  in mostcases  a viable remedy for terrorism can be found onlyif we drain the tributaries of hopelessness  anger andfrustration that feed the river of evil; otherwise theirconfluence can become explosive.Thirdly  it is both necessary and fair that we notconfuse those who are unjust with those who areunjustly treated. The international community shouldnot confuse terrorism  which we reject  condemn andfight  with the legitimate right of self-defence inconformity with norms compatible with our values: theright to defend oneself against aggression  occupation the usurpation of rights or attempts to erase culturalidentity. That right was exercised by the resistance thatliberated the United States more than two centuries agoand by that which liberated Europe from the Nazityranny that initiated the Holocaust but ended byperishing in its fire. Humanity and right were thusvictorious.I would like here to reiterate what everybodyknows: no religion  Islam  Christianity  Judaism orBuddhism  preaches terrorism. Those are allreligions that proclaim lofty values and ideals. It isinappropriate to blame them for the sins of a few oftheir followers who have gone astray. Our fight againstterrorism should proceed from our collective solidarityin cherishing life  and not from hatred  which is neithera solution nor a refuge.The world is at an extremely delicate juncture inits history. We are at a crossroads in internationalrelations. The enhancement of the Organization'scapacity to respond to the hopes and aspirations thatarose after the end of the cold war and its divisionscoincided with a trend towards neglecting that verycapacity  a deepening of new divisions and a resort tounilateral decisions. Such a trend can lead only todeadlock and prevent us from addressing issues thatmay determine the fate of humanity and its ability toreconcile itself with nature and with advancedtechnology and to take the opportunities that theyprovide for the achievement of a better life free frompoverty  want  disease  oppression and fear  a life inwhich justice and solidarity prevail.We must therefore break this deadlock  which isof benefit to no party or cause  by renewing ourcommitment to the Charter and reaffirming ourdetermination to work together to strengthen the UnitedNations  enhance its effectiveness  promote itsprinciples and champion its purposes in confrontingboth the old and the new dangers that face our world.One of these dangers is the persistence of hotbeds ofconflict and violence in the world  including theconflict from which we in the Middle East aresuffering.I would like to read out the statement madeyesterday by the President of Egypt  Mr. HosniMubarak. He said:I listened attentively to the statement madeby President Bush to the General Assembly  and Iwould like to welcome the positive elements inthat statement. First  I welcome the affirmationby the President of the United States that theUnited States is committed to the establishmentof an independent Palestinian State  side by sidewith Israel  and that all the parties must assumetheir responsibilities in order to achieve that goal.We hope that the peace process will receive astrong impetus through effective participation bythe United States  leading to a return of stabilityto the area and to a just and comprehensive peaceas early as possible.Secondly  with regard to Iraq  I welcomethe fact that the United States has opened thedoor to the pivotal role that must be played by theUnited Nations  in particular the SecurityCouncil  on the question of Iraq. Such a course ofaction will break the deadlock and prevent anynegative effects resulting from the escalation ofthe situation  thus maintaining the sovereigntyand territorial integrity of Iraq.In view of this  I am calling on the Iraqileadership to make use of this opportunity toimplement all the relevant Security Councilresolutions and accept the return of the inspectorsimmediately so that we can prevent an escalationof the situation and the dangerous consequencesthat would have a very negative impact on thesecurity and safety of the brotherly Iraqi peopleand of the Middle East as a whole.'The Palestinian people continue to suffer underan oppressive occupation that rejects the judgement ofhistory  embodied by the Charter  that the age ofcolonialism has long gone. It is an occupation thatclings to policies reminiscent of those of the era ofdarkness and chaos and may even bring us back to that7era. The Arabs have extended their hand to Israel witha unanimously adopted initiative that reflects theirgenuine belief in a peace that guarantees  withoutexceptions or double standards  the rights of all. IfIsrael genuinely desires peace  it must abandon itsgreed and illusions  put a stop to its practices andaggressive acts against the Palestinian people and theirlegitimate leadership and agree to withdraw from allArab territories occupied in 1967 in Palestine  Syriaand Lebanon. An independent Palestinian State  withEast Jerusalem as its capital  can then be establishedand can join all the Arab States that have demonstratedtheir readiness to establish normal relations with Israeland live with it in peace and security.Justice  right  mutual respect and the restorationto people of their rights were the building blocks onwhich peace between Egypt and Israel was established securing safe borders and normal relations during thepast 25 years. The other model  however  which Israelhas espoused with respect to our brethren in Palestine has achieved neither peace nor security; rather  it hasresulted in victims on both sides  who fall each day paying the price for an attempt to obstruct the naturalcourse of events.The international community must assume itsresponsibility in this regard  without prejudice striving only for what is right; unswerving  movingonly towards justice; and without ambition  except fora peace that will allow the peoples of the region toforge a better future. It must reaffirm the necessity ofabiding by the Charter  United Nations resolutions andthe agreements that have been signed  and must rejectany attempt to abandon them.The debate on security and stability in the MiddleEast relates also to the situation in Iraq  a situationthat must be dealt with in accordance with theprovisions of the Charter and relevant resolutions which all parties must respect  steering away from acourse of military action. Egypt reaffirms its rejectionof military strikes against Iraq  whose unity andterritorial integrity must be respected and which  for itspart  must respect the legitimate international will.We must do everything in our power to put an endto the extreme suffering of the people of Iraq. We mustend the embargo  which has inflicted great harm uponIraq  negatively affecting and the livelihood of itscitizens and damaging future generations.Any discussion of the United Nations  itsachievements and its future would be incompletewithout recalling the tangible contributions of theOrganization to focusing attention on the major issuesof our times and forging an international consensus onsome of them. This contribution has been realizedthrough a series of conferences convened during thelast decade of the twentieth century and the first yearsof this century on the environment  human rights population  social development  women  financing fordevelopment and sustainable development. It has beenachieved also through the recommendations of theMillennium Summit of the General Assembly  whichattempted to shape a conceptual framework for theOrganization's work  based on peace and security fornations and individuals  economic and socialdevelopment in its comprehensive sense  equalityamong States and respect for the cultural diversity ofnations and societies.In this regard  I would like to reaffirm theimportance of the faithful implementation  in bothletter and spirit  of the outcomes of those conferences.It is also important that no attempt is made to evade orcircumvent those mutual obligations. Ultimately  thejudgement of history will be based not on theintentions or objectives contained in politicaldeclarations and final documents  but rather on theextent of our success in implementing them. theirimplementation.Any just consideration of the internationaleconomic situation must conclude that it isunacceptable to continue the present disparities in thedistribution of wealth among the peoples of the Earth the lack of democracy in international economicdecision-making and the persistence of arbitrary tradepractices and monetary policies against the interests ofdeveloping countries  which have often led tosuccessive financial crises and resulted in the economiccollapse of many developing countries and thedestruction  in a matter of days  of the developmentgains made over decades of arduous national effort.Our African continent and its issues occupy aspecial place in the international community's effortsaimed at achieving economic and social developmentand maintaining international peace and security inaccordance with the collective responsibilities we allassume under the Charter. These efforts proceed from afirm conviction that the United Nations  the SecurityCouncil in particular  has primary responsibility for the8maintenance of peace and security in that continent.They also proceed from our conviction that we  asAfrican States  are indispensable partners that bear aspecial responsibility to resolve the conflicts thatfragment our continent and to formulate theprogrammes that would extricate our peoples from theanguish of poverty to join the course of progress andprosperity.Our continent has demonstrated its seriousness bylaunching the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  which was endorsed byAfrican heads of State at the Lusaka Summit of theOrganization of African Unity in 2001  and the AfricanUnion  which was inaugurated at the Summit held inDurban in July 2002. If by embracing these twoinitiatives African States have adopted an approach tobuilding their future on the basis of the highest idealsreflecting the noblest human thinking  then theinternational community for its part should support thatapproach in order to provide a better life for Africa'speoples  open markets for its products  inject foreigninvestment into its economies and assist it to solve itsproblems.The persistence of volatile conflicts and thedanger of the possession by States  organizations orindividuals of weapons of mass destruction make itincumbent upon us to be more diligent on disarmamentissues. At the regional level  Egypt has repeatedlycalled for serious engagement to rid the Middle East ofall weapons of mass destruction  first and foremostnuclear weapons  and to place all nuclear facilities inthe region  without exception  under internationalsupervision.Peace and security cannot be established in theMiddle East while a grave disparity persists in therights and obligations of the States of the region  whichupsets its balance of power. Regional stability will beachieved only when Israel accedes to the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  becauseit is the only State in the region that has not yet doneso. Such stability will also be attained through progresstowards the implementation of President Mubarak'sinitiative to rid the Middle East of all weapons of massdestruction and their delivery systems.In addition  the world confronts other ills thatrepresent both a challenge and an opportunity for us todemonstrate our ability to work together for the goodof all. Efforts to combat endemic diseases have fallenshort. Countries around the world suffer from thespread of HIV/AIDS  which threatens their stability;owing to their lack of capacity and resources they areunable to contain the pandemic  thus necessitatingassistance for those countries in dealing with the crisis.The world also confronts numerousenvironmental challenges such as those related tobiodiversity  climate change  drought anddesertification  all of which require the redoubling ofinternational efforts to address them in order tosafeguard the right of future generations to a securelife. Scarcity of water threatens the eruption ofconflicts in several regions of the world. Theinternational community must therefore maximize thebenefit from  and the proper management of  availablewater resources while respecting and protecting theacquired rights of States and the internationalagreements that govern the rights to utilize thoseresources.The sheer size  complexity and scope of all theseproblems may lead some to yield to pessimism andfrustration  but we are confident that the forces of goodin the world  armed with the noble principles of theCharter  to which we come here every year toreiterate our commitment  will remain resolute intheir determination to fashion a better tomorrow. Weare confident that humankind will overcome thepropensity for evil so that together we can forge aheadtowards frontiers made possible by unprecedentedtechnological progress at the outset of the twenty-firstcentury  progress which God has commanded us todedicate to our collective well-being so that the worldcan live in peace  security  prosperity and harmony.This will allow the young to flourish  potential toemerge  hope to overcome fear and pain  light toprevail over darkness and humankind to triumph overall that hinders its happiness  freedom andadvancement."
"53",2174,"ERI",57,2002,"﻿Let me start bycongratulating the President on his unanimous electionto preside  over the fifty-seventh session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. His election is an honour tohim and to his country  the Czech Republic. Thedelegation of the State of Eritrea assures you of its fullcooperation and support.Allow me also to extend to his predecessor  Mr.Han Seung-soo of the Republic of Korea  mydelegation's deep appreciation for a job well doneduring the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.Profound appreciation is also due to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tireless efforts tomake our United Nations more responsive andeffective.On this happy occasion  my delegation welcomesthe Swiss Confederation to the family of nations withgreat pleasure. We commend the decision taken by theSwiss people in allowing their great country to becomea full Member of the United Nations. The same wordsgo to the soon-to-be 191st Member of ourOrganization  the Democratic Republic of East Timor a country whose sovereignty and independence hasbeen won with sweat and blood  like that of my owncountry. Warm welcome from Eritrea  East Timor!The fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly is taking place at a time when the woundsand scars from the 11 September terrorist attack oneyear ago  in three locations over the soil of the UnitedStates  are still healing. Grief  pain and anger are stilllingering.At a gathering here at Headquarters this 11September to commemorate the first anniversary of theattack  Secretary-General Kofi Annan said “On 11 September grief enveloped theworld  not only out of solidarity with the peopleof the United States  but out of shared loss. Morethan 90 nations lost sons and daughters of theirown — murdered that day for no other reasonthan that they had chosen to live in this country.Today  we come together as a world communitybecause we were attacked as a worldcommunity.”The loss of almost 3 000 innocent lives in a singleday is so painful. The Eritrean people share the painand the grief. They reiterate their condolences to thosewho lost their loved ones  and they stand in solidaritywith the American people at this trying time. Indeed the attacks of 11 September have inevitably changedthe way we live and the way we see our world. Thisday has symbolized the alarm clock that rung aroundthe world to wake us all. My delegation regrets that ittook attacks of such magnitude to shake us from ourunwatchful sleep.22Terrorism is not a new phenomenon in mycountry. The State of Eritrea has suffered it since itsformal independence  in 1993  as the youngest countryin Africa. The Eritrean Islamic Jihad Movement andthe so-called Eritrean Popular Islamic Conference werecreated and sponsored by Al Qaeda and other regionaland international Islamic groups to perpetratesubversive acts in Eritrea for the last 10 years. In 1994 Eritrean security forces intercepted a mixed group ofterrorists that included in their ranks Al Qaeda-trainednationals from several countries. In 1995  this groupmurdered four Belgian tourists inside Eritrea in coldblood. Sporadic cross-border acts of terror andsubversion continue to this day.In a statement contained in document S/1997/517of 7 July 1997  my Government first warned theinternational community  and subsequently the thenOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the SecurityCouncil  that international terrorist threats fromextreme fundamentalist Islamic groups were on theway.The Eritrean Jihad terrorist movements  which aremembers of the Al Qaeda network  are now part of theso-called Alliance of Eritrean National Forces. Thisumbrella organization has bases and physical presencesin some neighbouring  and a number of Western countries. These groups continue to obtain sanctuary as well as financial and other forms of assistance  fromWestern capitals.As the fight against international terrorismassumes high priority and warrants concerted action the Government of Eritrea requests full cooperationand joint action from the countries where these terroristelements live  plan and launch their operations. At thisjuncture  I also wish to reiterate to the Assembly thatthe people and Government of Eritrea will continue tofight terrorism in all its forms.Despite the declaration by the 1999 AlgiersSummit of the OAU to make the year 2000 the year toend conflicts and to start a new momentum for peace inAfrica  conflicts have continued to take a heavy toll onAfrican peoples in many countries of the continent.This is indeed disappointing.I come from the Horn of Africa  a subregionwhere conflicts and wars have been a way of life formany decades. The Horn of Africa is also a place thathas seen many misfortunes. Recurring conflicts overpast decades have claimed hundreds of thousands oflives  displaced a staggering number of people andforced millions out of their countries to live as refugeesin foreign lands.The internal conflict in the Sudan is now thelongest running one in Africa. Under the framework ofthe Inter-Governmental Authority on Development(IGAD)  a subregional entity  the State of Eritrea together with the other member countries  is doing itsbest to bring about a resolution to this conflict. Wehave come a long way in bringing the conflictingparties to face-to-face  talks. There are encouragingsigns  but we cannot congratulate ourselves yet. Ourefforts may be considered a success once quieter daysof peace  stability and sustained prosperity prevail inthat sisterly country. I must admit that we need the helpof the international community to end the suffering ofour brothers and sisters in the Sudan.In the same vein  the problem in Somalia  anothersisterly country in the Horn  continues to be a seriousone that the international community cannot ignore.The vicious conflict in Somalia will have long-termcatastrophic humanitarian consequences if theinternational community abandons this unfortunatecountry. The United Nations and the world communityat large must help the Transitional NationalGovernment of Somalia to stabilize peace and securityin the country. The international community shouldrush to save Somalia.Now  on a positive note  let me tell the Assemblythe good news regarding the border conflict betweenmy country and Ethiopia. On 13 April this year  theEritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission  a panel of fivejudges established by the Algiers agreement  made ajudicial ruling on the entire 1 000-kilometer borderbetween the two countries. The people andGovernment of Eritrea are pleased to see a legalsolution to a conflict they never chose.My Government believed from the verybeginning that this conflict could not be settled bymight  but by peaceful means alone. The pacifist A. J.Muste said it all: “There is no way to peace. Peace isthe way”.The Boundary Commission has drawn the newborder and is currently in the process of physicallydemarcating the lines on the ground. Completion of thedemarcation is expected in the next few months.According to the Algiers agreement  which bothcountries signed  the decision of the Commission is23final and binding. Eritrea has reiterated its acceptanceof the Commission's decision of 13 April 2002. Eritreatherefore believes that territorial claims and counter-claims ended on that day. In legal terms  the conflictended then too.Now that the conflict has legally been put to rest the people of Eritrea want to leave this awfulexperience behind them and move on with life afresh.As Carl Bard said  “Though no one can go back andmake a brand new start  anyone can start from now andmake a brand new ending.” What matters is thedestination point. The people and Government ofEritrea are committed to turning things around.At the end of this saga  my delegation finds itfitting to pay tribute at the General Assembly to ourpeace-loving friends and partners who helped us to gethere. Allow me therefore to particularly thank theformer Organization of African Unity  now the AfricanUnion; President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria; theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. KofiAnnan; the Government of the United States ofAmerica; and the European Union. We are grateful tothem all for their valued efforts in this difficult andlong peace process.The year 2002 saw five important internationalgatherings aimed at bringing peace  security  humandignity and economic prosperity to the peoples of theworld  big and small alike. Those meetings includedthe International Conference on Financing forDevelopment in Monterrey  the Second WorldAssembly on Ageing in Madrid  the special session onchildren in New York  the World Food Summit inRome and  lastly  the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment in Johannesburg. The promises anddeclarations of all these international events are tied inwith the goals of the 2000 United Nations MillenniumDeclaration.As we all know  those goals embrace the keydimensions of human development — related topoverty  hunger  education and health — stated as a setof time-bound targets. Those targets are: halvingpoverty and hunger  achieving universal primaryeducation and gender equality  reducing under-5mortality by two thirds and maternal mortality by threequarters  halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and halvingthe proportion of people who lack access to safe water.With 1990 as the base year  those targets are to beachieved by 2015.Despite the promises of globalization and themany initiatives launched at various times to help thecontinent  Africa's economic growth is still lagging farbehind. The success of development in Africa stilldepends on the political will of rich countries toprovide financial assistance  on the one hand  and onthe full ownership and effective execution of nationaldevelopment programmes by African countriesthemselves  on the other.Having said that  I shall now  for the benefit ofour partners  reiterate the five core principlesunderlying Eritrea's development strategy: first developing the capabilities of our people as theprincipal asset and driving force of our developmentendeavours; secondly  establishing strong public-private sector partnerships; thirdly  striving to achieveself-reliance and avoiding chronic and debilitatingdependency; fourthly  protecting the environment fromthe adverse effects of development programmes; andfifthly  establishing effective development partnershipswith multilateral and bilateral development agencies with Governments and with non-governmentalorganizations.I would be remiss if I failed to bring to theattention of the Assembly the looming drought thatthreatens the lives of more than 1 million men  womenand children in Eritrea. The failure of vital rainsexpected in the months of April and May has put theirlives at risk. Famine is imminent if international aiddoes not reach the Eritrean people soon. I wish to usethis occasion  therefore  to appeal to the donorcommunity to respond to this pressing humanitarianneed.In conclusion  I wish to express my delegation'sconfidence that  under your able leadership  Mr.President  the fifty-seventh session will see muchsuccess."
"54",2220,"ESP",57,2002,"﻿Theworld has changed since the Assembly last met. Thetwenty-first century began on 11 September 2001  andour great collective challenge is to ensure the primacyof the rule of law in the sphere of internationalrelations. The natural forum for that legal culture andlegitimacy is the United Nations.In that context and with that ambition participating in the great objectives of peace  the ruleof law and the preservation of the internationalorder  to which the Secretary-General referredduring the current session  it is an honour for me toaddress the Assembly on behalf of Spain  also acandidate for a non-permanent seat on the SecurityCouncil. Should we be elected  we are determined todevote all the effort and resources necessary to fulfilthat great responsibility.A year ago  the entire world became aware of thehorror of terrorism that threatens us all. We askedourselves then what course the internationalcommunity should take and what role the UnitedNations should play in shaping international relationsin the twenty-first century. Uncertainty remains  but itis now clear that interdependence among countries andregions will be the centre of gravity of a newborninternational civil society. States must cooperate withone another to make use of opportunities and to fightagainst threats  because neither opportunities northreats have a purely local character.Thus  it is time for the rule of law  and the UnitedNations  as the seat of the political and normativelegitimacy of international society  is called to be thecentre of gravity of this new framework. The UnitedNations is the organization that can and shouldimpose  including through the use of force  if it isunavoidable  the decisions taken collectively by thecommunity of States.The occasions on which the United Nations hasbeen able to respond to the demands of theinternational community have also been successes forthe Member States. In the same way  the cases in whichthe United Nations has been unable to find solutions toexisting problems have also been our responsibility. Allof us make up the United Nations; its failures are ourfailures  as its successes are our successes.Terrorism is a clear example of this and of theneed to react together resolutely. Each terrorist attack isan attack against us all  and we must all react.Terrorists do not respect borders; borders shouldtherefore not constitute an obstacle to the collectivefight against this scourge. Are there any today who stillthink that this problem does not  or will not  affectthem?The United Nations is aware of the gravity of thethreat that this scourge poses to the principles thatunderpin the Charter and that are the foundation of ourcivilization. Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)has put international cooperation against terrorism on asubstantially different level. That resolution charts thecourse for the cooperation that is essential for theinternational community to be able to deal with thosewho attack our most essential values: life  freedom anddemocracy.The growing importance of law has a very directbearing upon the intense activity of the Organization infavour of human rights. In this context  allow me tofocus on a heinous and silent violation of human rights:domestic violence. This scourge primarily affectswomen  children and older persons  the mostvulnerable sectors of society in all our cultures regardless of level of development or social well-being.How can we explain  shamefully ignore and  thus  inindirectly accept  that violence against women shouldtoday be the cause of more death and disability thancancer  traffic accidents or even war? Can we toleratethis situation? As a woman and as a human being  I saythat the answer is an unambiguous no.In the same vein  the International Criminal Courtis an essential legal instrument to ensure that the mostserious violations of human rights do not gounpunished. With its subsidiary jurisdiction  the Courtrepresents the most significant advance in the16structuring of the international community since theSan Francisco Charter.In the framework of this reinvigoration of law the Organization must pay special attention tochallenges stemming from new technologies  inparticular those associated with biotechnology. We donot want uncontrolled science with unclear objectivesto determine the future shape of our societies  bringingto life the terrifying allegory of Aldous Huxley's BraveNew World. Spain  which along with other countries ofthe European Union has ratified the OviedoConvention on Human Rights and Biomedicine  aprotocol to which bans cloning for research purposes recalls the fact that article 11 of the UniversalDeclaration on The Human Genome and HumanRights  approved by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in1997 and unanimously endorsed by the GeneralAssembly in 1998  already bans human cloning forreproductive purposes. Therefore  it is necessary to gobeyond that prohibition in a new convention.In spite of these encouraging results underdevelopment  poverty  the existence of weaponsof mass destruction and regional crises  in particularthe crisis in the Middle East  constitute some of theoutstanding tasks before us. Allow me briefly to reviewthese issues in order  in the words of Pablo Neruda not to fill our hearts with salt  but to walk inknowledge.'In the difficult struggle for development  weshould all invest both our efforts and our hopes. In thatregard  I would like to reiterate what was saidyesterday with regard to the Monterrey and theJohannesburg summits and the New Partnership forAfrica's Development (NEPAD)  for poverty is foughtby recognizing human rights and freedoms and bypromoting the rule of law.In mentioning development  I wish to stress onceagain the importance of women in the world. Theirlagging behind  and their explicit or implicit secondarystatus  their role in general  are very often patentlyunfair. This situation is the source of the shortcomingsof many societies. Let us recall that the advancement ofwomen is not only an obvious right  it also likelyrepresents the most effective and promising strategy tocope with the persistent nightmare ofunderdevelopment.In any case  poverty must be eradicated whereverit exists  both in the poorest countries as well as inmiddle-income countries  which are joining the globaleconomy while undergoing fragile political andeconomic processes. Middle-income countriesfrequently have large pockets of poverty and areespecially vulnerable to global economic swings. LatinAmerica is a good example of a continent where in thelast decade an important and successful effort has beenmade to put in place democratic regimes  fostereconomic growth and open up to the world economy. Itis crucial to ensure continued international supportwhen this process is threatened by temporarydifficulties.Disarmament no doubt poses another challengefor all of us  notwithstanding the progress made in theareas of anti-personnel mines  small arms and chemicalweapons. In this context  Spain is following withunderstandable concern the development of eventsregarding Iraq. For the sake of international securityand stability and for the welfare of the Iraqi people  wehope that the announced immediate and unconditionalreturn of arms inspectors in accordance with SecurityCouncil resolutions 687 (1991) and 1284 (1999) willbecome a reality. The Iraqi regime is currentlyflagrantly violating those resolutions. Arms inspectionsmust be accompanied by Iraqi guarantees to theinternational community that it will destroy itsweapons of mass destruction. That is the only possiblepath towards lifting the sanctions and normalizingIraq's relations with the international community. Ifnecessary  the international community must assume itsresponsibilities and ensure compliance with theresolutions adopted by the body that embodiesinternational legitimacy.The citizens of our States fail to understand whysome regional crisis continue indefinitely  causingdespair among the peoples who suffer from them andgenerating a sense of injustice that fuels hatred andbitterness. Encouraging progress has undoubtedly beenmade  especially in Africa  and we spoke of thatprogress yesterday. But the Middle East crisiscontinues to be in all our minds.Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973)  and 1397 (2002)  the principles of the MadridConference and the agreements between the partieshave established a framework for peace betweenIsraelis and Palestinians. How many Palestinians andIsraelis will still have to die and how many17international resolutions will we need before Palestineand Israel can live together as States in peace andmutual respect? It is necessary to complete the peaceprocess; that is the goal of the negotiating efforts of theQuartet  which Spain supports.We must counter these crises with our ability tocarry out dialogue and negotiation. Spain has promotedintegration mechanisms  particularly in theMediterranean region through the Barcelona process.In that regard  Spain has always given special attentionto its contacts with the Arab world  with which itmaintains special relationships. In that context  I wouldlike to make a brief reference to our relations with theMaghreb.Spain is among the Maghreb's foremostcommercial partners  in addition to being one of themain investor countries there. Hundreds of thousandsof citizens from Maghreb countries live in Spain making up Spain's largest resident foreign communityand contributing to the creation of wealth through theirwork and dynamism. Spain has therefore for manyyears made the Maghreb the main focus of itsinternational cooperation policy.All of this means that maintaining strong andfruitful relations with Morocco is a strategic priority ofSpanish foreign policy. The clearest expression of thatpriority is the treaty of friendship  cooperation andgood-neighbourliness that exists between our countries.The Government of Spain wishes to promote relationsin all areas and once again to place those relations onthe level they deserve  given the proximity of our twopeoples and the importance of our common interests. Iam confident that my Moroccan colleague's next visitto Madrid will be a good opportunity to make progressalong that path.In any case  I wish to clearly emphasize heretoday that the autonomous communities of Ceuta andMelilla are an integral part of Spain  on an equalfooting with the rest of Spain's autonomouscommunities. They are therefore an integral part of theEuropean Union. Their citizens are represented in theSpanish and European Parliaments  with the samestanding and in the same manner as the rest of ourcitizens.The tasks before the Organization require that itsmechanisms function adequately. Spain looks forwardto the Secretary-General's forthcoming report on thereform of the Organization. We support in-depthreform of the Security Council that addresses allaspects of the matter.Before ending my statement  I cannot fail tomention the question of Gibraltar and the recurrentmandates of the General Assembly urging Spain andthe United Kingdom to continue their bilateralnegotiations to find a permanent solution to thisdispute. I am pleased to inform the Assembly thatduring the past year the Governments of both countrieshave deployed intense negotiating efforts in this regard and that we have made substantial progress. We intendto continue these negotiations in a constructive spirit sothat as soon as possible we may reach a satisfactoryand comprehensive agreement that takes into accountthe legitimate interests of the residents of the colony aswell as the traditional United Nations doctrine withregard to Gibraltar  a doctrine confirmed year after yearby the resolutions of both the General Assembly andthe Special Committee of 24.Let us be clear: now  the beginning of thetwenty-first century  is the time to resolve thisquestion  in accordance with the relevant resolutionscalling for the implementation of the principle ofterritorial integrity. For all of those reasons  wecondemn attempts to interfere with the naturaldevelopment of such negotiations  actions that openlyand flagrantly violate that doctrine.I cannot conclude without giving a very warmwelcome  and offering my country's cooperation  toSwitzerland  as well as to the Democratic Republic ofTimor-Leste  which will soon become a Member of theUnited Nations.Our meetings within this building give rise tomany plans  ideas and  of course  words. But they alsogive rise to action. The action of the United Nations  aswell as that of each of its Member States  must not beconfined within these walls; millions of people dependon our ability to implement all that has been discussedhere in order to enjoy a better life or simply to protectthe life they have. Spain is fully aware of thisresponsibility and we are ready to work alongside otherMembers of the Organization so that words may betransformed into deeds  and deeds transformed intoresults."
"55",2246,"EST",57,2002,"﻿Let me begin bywelcoming the United Nations new Member Switzerland who has always been devoted to the causeof the United Nations and has now finally decided tojoin us. I look forward to welcoming East Timor as thenewest Member of the Organization in the very nearfuture. I would also like to pass on my congratulationsto the newly elected President of the GeneralAssembly.Today I would like to address three subjects ofmajor concern for our globalizing world: the struggleagainst terrorism  human trafficking  and sustainabledevelopment.A year ago today  the whole world was stillrecoiling from the horrendous terrorist attacks in theUnited States. Immediately after the terror attacks most States  including Estonia  and almost allinternational organizations expressed their solidaritywith the United States.12We also associated ourselves with the NorthAtlantic Council's statement of 12 September 2001 which invoked article 5 of the Washington Treaty  aswell as with relevant European Union statements andundertakings.Estonia is actively participating in theinternational coalition to combat terrorism. We havecontributed a search and rescue team to OperationEnduring Freedom under United States leadership. Ourhighly trained explosives detection dog team ispresently serving in Afghanistan alongside the forcesof the other countries  which are helping to restoreorder in that war-torn land.We appreciate the noteworthy role of the UnitedNations and its Security Council in the universalcampaign against terrorism. We fully recognize theimportance of preventive measures and furtherstandard-setting in this field. To date  not a singlecrime that could be classified as terrorism has beencommitted in Estonia. However  let me assure you thatEstonia will continue to make all efforts necessary tofulfil its role in this ongoing quest for comprehensiveinternational security.Indeed  I can announce for the record that Estoniahas ratified all the relevant United Nations conventionsand has promptly presented reports to the appropriateparties about the implementation of the variousSecurity Council resolutions.We are confident that truly joint efforts  whichmake use of the input of all States  will eventuallyenable the international community to makeremarkable progress in the global struggle againstterrorism. In this regard  cooperation to counter theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is ofparticular significance  since sooner or later  terroristsmight actually gain access to these ghastly tools ofdoom.Today  the United Nations faces the challenge ofupholding its authority. For the sake of our future  andthe prestige and relevancy of the United Nations  it isessential that the United Nations does not shy awayfrom reacting effectively and decisively whenconfronted with real and formidable dangers. Full andunconditional implementation of Security Councilresolutions is obligatory for all Members  just as is theeffective enforcement of these resolutions.Therefore  we value highly the decisiveness ofthe international community to implement theresolutions dealing with Iraq. Estonia supports theSecretary-General's further efforts to obtain Iraq'scompliance with the Security Council resolutions. Thereturn of the United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraqis just a beginning. Further acts will have to follow.The possible results of internationalindecisiveness and appeasement are well illustrated bythe history of the League of Nations  whichdisappeared from the international arena  just as didsome of its member States  including my homeland Estonia. The result was an international conflagrationthat left a large part of the civilized world in ruins  thevery ruins upon which the United Nations Organizationwas founded. This taught us all a very essentiallesson — inaction can often be much more disastrousthan action.Another important issue which deserves to betouched upon here is human trafficking  in particulartrafficking in women. The Estonian Governmentrecently acceded to the three Protocols additional to theUnited Nations Convention against TransnationalOrganized Crime  including the Protocol to Prevent Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons  EspeciallyWomen and Children. In June 2001  at the Women andDemocracy Conference in Lithuania  the Nordic andBaltic Ministers for Gender Equality decided to launcha joint Nordic-Baltic information campaign againsttrafficking in women.The aim of the campaign  which will continue atleast until the beginning of 2003  is to turn the generalpublic's attention to the problems of prostitution andtrafficking in people and to initiate public discussionabout the problems surrounding the issue of traffickingin women. The joint campaign is being carried outsimultaneously in the eight Nordic and Balticcountries  with all relevant institutions concentrating throughout this year  on the matter of how best tocombat this problem. We hope that we will soon havesome concrete proposals for drafting amendments toappropriate national legislation.The problem of trafficking in women  however  ispart of a broader series of issues relating to women including their position in society  their participation inthe decision-making process and so on. In order todiscuss all of these topics in depth and to highlight13women's role in democratic societies  Estonia willhost  in February 2003  a major internationalconference on women and democracy. I sincerely hopethat that conference will help to further the cause ofwomen's rights.Another crucial issue on the global agenda  andthe last topic that I wish to speak about  is developmentcooperation and sustainable development. Havingparticipated in the Monterrey discussions  and in thewake of the Johannesburg Conference  I would like toemphasize that the most important factor for sustainedand sustainable development is a clear national goaland a road map for achieving it. Estonia is in theprocess of drafting a special sustainable developmentstrategy  a process involving the cooperation of bothcivil society and the private sector.Estonia acknowledges the problem ofenvironmental deterioration  and we have taken actionto tackle it. Estonia has ratified the Kyoto Protocol —among many other international and regionalagreements concerning the environment — and we willdo our best to fully implement the decisions made inJohannesburg.Since the successful implementation of recentinternational decisions depends largely on theconcerted action of the various parties  communicationand access to information are becoming key issues.Bridging the digital divide between the haves and thehave-nots is essential if we want all countries to benefitequally from globalization. Thanks to our rapid rate ofprogress  Estonia has been able to support developmentin various other countries.The creation of an e-governance academy inEstonia — a cooperative effort involving the EstonianGovernment  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme and the Open Society Institute — is asignificant step towards bridging the digital gap withthe countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia. Theacademy will also be open to other interested regions.The academy will draw on the experiences gained invarious environments  thereby providing broadknowledge that will enable participants to choose orcreate the best solution for their particular situation.Among other things  this project demonstrates thesynergy that can be created from cooperation betweenGovernments  international organizations and non-governmental organizations.Today I have spoken about some of the issues onthe global agenda  all of which have been discussed atlength at recent international meetings andconferences. Those discussions provided us with usefulsignposts  agreements and decisions. Now it is time toimplement them."
"56",2292,"ETH",57,2002,"﻿First of all  I wish toextend to Mr. Jan Kavan congratulations on his electionas President of the fifty-seventh session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. I also wish to take thisopportunity to commend his predecessor for hisinvaluable contribution to what was achieved at thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Allow mealso to express our appreciation to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the effort he has beenmaking to ensure that the United Nations becomes amore effective instrument for tackling the very manychallenges faced by the international community.My delegation would like to join others inwelcoming the admission of the Swiss Confederationto the United Nations. It is a country that has  indeed contributed so much to the Organization over the years.Our continent  Africa  and its peoples  continue toface enormous and daunting challenges. This is notnew. This is something that has been going on for thelast few decades  with the general economic and socialsituation in the continent deteriorating even further.The general trend has been one of an ever-fastermarginalization of Africa. The continent has yet to seethe benefits of globalization. Africa still awaits thecreation of an enabling international economic contextfor progress in its efforts to wage war against poverty.That effort is unlikely to succeed without greaterinternational cooperation. Many in Africa  includingmy own country  Ethiopia  are unlikely to meet theinternationally agreed poverty-related targets andgoals  including those set by the United NationsMillennium Declaration  without greater readiness onthe part of the international community to contributemore to Africa's fight against poverty.The eradication of poverty is not only Africa'schallenge or only that of the developing world. As wasreiterated at the Johannesburg World Summit onSustainable Development  poverty is the greatest globalchallenge facing the world. The despair andhopelessness engendered by poverty have implicationsfor the world in general — not only for the people ofthe South but for those of the North  as well.Many might have felt that the JohannesburgSummit failed to rise to the occasion and that itsachievement was not commensurate with the gravity ofthe challenges faced by the peoples of the world in avariety of areas  most of all  in areas most relevant tothe eradication of poverty. But there was one thingwhich was unambiguously evident at the JohannesburgSummit. Those from both the North and the Southstressed with one voice that the global apartheid wecurrently have is unsustainable. How can oneimplement that vision? This is what continues to eludethe international community. It remains the casedespite some progress that has been made  including atMonterrey.The eradication of poverty in Africa  and in myown country  is not primarily the responsibility of theinternational community. It is primarily ourresponsibility to put our houses in order and to take thelead in rejuvenating Africa.That is where in fact today there is a newdevelopment in Africa. Many in Africa are moreprepared than ever before to take charge of theirdestiny. There is a new thinking in Africa today and arealistic resolve to ensure the regeneration of thecontinent. I am referring to the New Partnership forAfrica's Development (NEPAD). It is an initiative byAfrica which demonstrates the readiness of thecontinent to take charge of its future. It is a concrete18commitment by Africa to take the necessary steps inboth the economic and political areas towards creatingenabling conditions for economic and socialtransformation. It is a realistic initiative that specifiesand underlines the obligation of African countries in allareas relevant to the creation of conditions conduciveto economic and social development. Good governanceis one such vital obligation to which the initiativeaccords the necessary importance. It is a major step forAfrica and one whose significance should beunderlined. The commitment to democracy and goodgovernance has major implications for Africa not onlyin economic development but also in creatingconditions for nurturing peace and stability.Nonetheless  NEPAD cannot succeed without thecooperation of Africa's partners and the internationalcommunity. And succeed it must  not only becauseNEPAD's success is in the vital interest of Africa butalso because it is in the interest of the world in general.The logic of globalization makes it obvious that no partof the globe is immune to the negative influencesemanating from its other  less fortunate parts.Realistically speaking  we swim or sink together. Itwould be unwise to believe that the growingmarginalization and decay of Africa will have nosignificant adverse implications for the stability andviability of the globalizing world. It is this commoninterest that we all share which is the basis for ourmutual obligation for the success of NEPAD. I muststate here that we have been encouraged by thepreliminary response to NEPAD by many members ofthe international community  including the G-8countries and others. We are still hopeful that evengreater support and enthusiasm will be demonstratedby the international community to ensure that NEPADwill be workable.Ethiopia subscribes fully to the NEPADframework. We are indeed at present in the process ofimplementing the principles and ideas promoted by theinitiative. We will continue to be committed to carryingout our obligations for good governance  for creatingenabling conditions for economic development and foreradicating poverty.All the efforts we are making to ensure success inthe fight against poverty are bound to fail withoutpeace and durable stability. Here as well  Africa including our subregion  the Horn of Africa  requiresthe effective support of the international community.What we need is enlightened support which istransparent and targeted at ensuring durable peace andstability. What we require is support not compromisedby tactical considerations which are short-sighted andlikely to aggravate already existing problems. Coddlingunaccountable Governments would not promote peacein the long run and would not bring about durablestability.Ours is a region which has suffered so much among other things because of strategic considerationswhich made expedient the propping up ofunaccountable and authoritarian regimes. The result ofall that has been disastrous for the region. Peace andstability in the Horn of Africa  as is true in all parts ofthe world  is dependent in a critical manner on thecreation of conditions for good governance. This is avalue which ought to be universally applied  includingin our subregion. Durable peace demands it. Thewelfare of the people of our subregion makes itimperative.Ethiopia will leave no stone unturned for peace inour subregion and in Africa as a whole. The effort wehave been making for peace in Somalia within theframework of the Intergovernmental Authority onDevelopment is being made in that spirit. It is also inthat same spirit that we shall continue to do our sharefor peace and national reconciliation in the Sudan.Most of all  we draw satisfaction from the fact that wehave managed to come out of a war that was imposedon us. For our part  we are determined to leave behindthe crisis we had with Eritrea. We shall remaincommitted to the peace process until its conclusion.It has always been our conviction that it is in thevital interest of Ethiopia to nurture peace in oursubregion. That is required by the war we have to wageagainst poverty  which is the only real enemy we have.But the promotion of the cause of peace in the Horn ofAfrica has not been that easy. Our subregion is an areaof the world that has long been vulnerable to terroristactivities. Ours has been an area that  due in part to theprevalence of poverty  has been taken advantage ofvery recklessly. My own country has been among thoseto have suffered as a result. This is a challenge that westill have to contend with  and which we still continueto face. This first-hand experience of ours put us in aposition where we can deeply share the anguish of thepeople of the United States over the 11 Septemberterrorist attack  which we have condemned vehemently.As we mark the first anniversary of that evil deed  we19wish once again to express our solidarity with theUnited States and its people.It is our conviction that success in the fightagainst international terrorism requires the genuinecooperation and solidarity of the entire internationalcommunity  no matter who might be the target of suchterrorism. All those who directly or indirectly supportand encourage terrorism should be held accountable.Resources made available to terrorist groups  inwhatever guise  should not be tolerated regardless ofthe area where this is taking place. In short  what isrequired is zero tolerance for terrorism regardless of itsintended targets. It is not without reason that I amreiterating this point. For us in Ethiopia  terrorism isnot a theoretical threat. It is a practical and immediatethreat that we have had to face both before and after 11September  including most recently. It is our earnesthope that the international community will do whateveris necessary to eliminate this scourge. We also hopethat there will be better days ahead  when we will allconcentrate on addressing the challenges that troubleour planet.I would like to conclude by renewing Ethiopia'scommitment to the United Nations and to what itstands for. We wish to see the United Nations becomean even a more effective universal Organization and amore forceful and faithful custodian of the principles ofinternational law. Our hope and our dream is that theUnited Nations will be an even more robust universalOrganization catering to the legitimate interests of bothbig and small counties. We in Ethiopia will continue tocontribute our share to the greater nurturing ofmultilateralism and to making the United Nations aneffective custodian of those values."
"57",2338,"FIN",57,2002,"﻿One year after theterrible attacks of 11 September  we commemorate theinnocent victims of those crimes. The best way we canhonour their memory is by taking up and acting uponall the many-faceted challenges that terrorism andother threats pose to human security. The world haschanged irrevocably  although we cannot as yet sayexactly how. We do not even know if our immediatereaction a year ago has been successfully put to use tomake the world a better and safer place in which tolive.Afghanistan is no longer a base for globalterrorism  and joint efforts to uproot terrorist networksare making progress  but the threat of new attacks hasnot been eliminated. At some stage we will also reachthe limit of what can be done through military forceand police action alone to stop terrorism. Even wherethe use of military force is clearly necessary andjustified  as it was against Al Qaeda and the Taliban  itis never an adequate answer. In Afghanistan we arenow faced with the need to use a full range of civiliancrisis management capabilities  as well as with theneed for a long-term commitment to reconstruction andthe development of a stable and drug-free economy and to enable democracy and respect for human rightsto take root in a country that has suffered from war andstrife for decades. And Afghanistan is only one ofmany places in today's world where such acommitment from the international community isneeded.We must also come to grips with conditions inwhich some people can regard even terrorism asjustified. To say that does not imply any understandingfor indiscriminate terrorism. Terrorism is a crimewhose perpetrators must be brought to justiceirrespective of their motives.It is vitally important to underline the need tostrengthen the rule of law. When terrorists attackdemocracy  humanity and justice  we should not andcannot fight it with means that are in conflict withthose basic values that the terrorists are attacking. It istime to review frankly the measures taken after 1125September and to rectify any excesses that are notacceptable in societies based on freedom and justice.The International Criminal Court (ICC) has beenin gestation for many years  and its creation can beregarded as one of the major achievements of theUnited Nations. It was not created primarily to dealwith terrorism  but the importance of the ICC hasobviously grown  not diminished  since 11 September.The ICC is a long-standing goal of Finland and theEuropean Union  and we must not allow it to beundermined. The ICC must not become an issue ofinternational dispute. We must safeguard it as aneffective and independent judicial institution so that wecan convince those States that remain outside it to joinus in making it truly universal.Terrorism is only one of many new threats to oursecurity that are no longer linked to the threat oftraditional war between nation-States.In a world where our entire national defencepolicies and our efforts to build collective securityhave been based on the need to wage or detertraditional war  we now need new and fresh thinking. Itis not only that military power has become partlyimpotent in delivering security. It is also evident thatwe cannot contain these threats through isolation or byacting unilaterally.The United Nations and its Security Council haveglobal responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Human lives areequally valuable all over the world. People in crisissituations need the protection and the action of theinternational community. Individual and minor crisescan turn into major threats to international peace andsecurity. Member States must give the United Nationsthe wherewithal that is necessary for meaningful actionin preventing crises  managing conflicts and buildingpeace after conflicts. Action needs true commitment tomultilateralism  which must exceed national interestsand unilateralism. Multilateralism cannot be exercisedà la carte whenever convenient. Global interests requireglobal action.An undeniable success story in the history of theUnited Nations is the Organization's peacekeepingactivities. Countless lives have been saved by UnitedNations peacekeeping operations. But we know  too that possibly even more lives have been lost if andwhen the United Nations has not been able or allowedto operate. The reason has been the lack of politicalwill or the prevalence of national interests in theSecurity Council. I would like to reiterate that theSecurity Council is mandated to act on behalf of allMember States.The concept of peacekeeping has evolvedconsiderably during the existence of the United Nationsfrom purely military operations into versatile  complexand continuous efforts that extend in some cases tonation-building. A growing element in them is civiliancrisis management. This should be furtherstrengthened. Crisis management in its wholecontinuum should also be based on broad cooperationand compatibility. Present complex crises are often toodemanding for any one organization to deal with. Allregional organizations should work closely togetherwith the United Nations and other organizationssharing the burden of maintaining international peaceand security.The Middle East remains the region where ourconcerns are most concentrated. The conflict betweenIsrael and Palestine has  if anything  worsened. Wesupport all efforts of the “quartet” to get the peaceprocess working again on the basis of the relevantUnited Nations resolutions. We support the Palestinianadministration's effort at reform  which we have rightlydemanded must be undertaken  and we expect a one-hundred-per-cent effort from it to stop all terroristactivities. At the same time  the Palestinians must begiven the prospect of a clear commitment and atimetable for the creation of an independent and viablePalestinian State. The Palestinian administration has tobe given the resources and conditions with which it canfulfil the requirements of what the internationalcommunity demands of it and of what the Palestinianpeople have the right to expect.Without progress in the Middle East peaceprocess  any military action in the region can haveextremely dangerous and unforeseen consequences. Itis imperative that efforts to get Iraq to abideunconditionally with all the resolutions of the SecurityCouncil remain the responsibility of the UnitedNations.When the United Nations was founded  theworld's population was 2.4 billion. Now we are morethan 6 billion  and population growth  while slowlylevelling off  will bring that number to at least 10billion before stabilizing. This is a huge challenge formankind. We have only a few decades  at most  to26bring our economic  production and societal models toconform to the exigencies of sustainable development.But this is not only an environmental challenge.Nations and peoples must learn to live and to acttogether in an ever-shrinking world where no one canmanage on his own.In a rapidly globalizing world  the need for keeninternational cooperation becomes all the more evident.Decisions taken in one part of the world have manyeffects elsewhere. This can quickly lead to an ever-widening gap and fragmentation between countries andwithin countries. Comprehensive implementation of theMillennium Declaration will make an important impacton narrowing that gap. A positive example of themeans we can employ to meet the goals of theDeclaration is the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  which demonstrates thegenuine desire of the African nations to takeresponsibility for their future. Finland attaches greatimportance to the implementation of NEPAD.Globalization has wealth-creating potentialthrough the international division of labour and a moreefficient use of resources. It can increase individualfreedom and make societies more open. But  on theother hand  it is incontestable that globalization has notbenefited everybody or every country in an equalmanner. Globalization can bring risks and threats to theenvironment  core labour standards and trade unions and it can challenge national and minority cultures. Itcan also be socially damaging. On the whole  however globalization is not only inevitable but also potentiallypositive. The United Nations has an important role inmanaging and harnessing globalization for the benefitof all. We the Member States must fully participate inthat work."
"58",2382,"FJI",57,2002,"﻿Please accept  Mr. President the warm congratulations of the Republic of the FijiIslands on your election to lead this forum. I alsoextend my appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. HanSeung-soo of the Republic of Korea  for his guidanceof the General Assembly during the past year. We alsowish to congratulate Switzerland on its admission tothe Organization  as well as East Timor on its imminentmembership of the United Nations. Their membershipgives them a direct share in the collectiveresponsibility of the United Nations to promote worldpeace  security and development.When I last spoke here  in September 2000  mycountry was in the throes of its most dangerous crisis following an armed uprising against the electedGovernment. However  with God's help and with thesupport of our own citizens and the understanding offriends overseas  we have passed through the worst. Wereturned to parliamentary democracy through generalelections in August last year. We have been welcomedback into the Commonwealth and granted leadership ofthe African  Caribbean and Pacific Group of States(ACP). Recently  we hosted the third summit of ACPleaders  as well as the thirty-third meeting of thePacific Islands Forum. Our economy is growing again and we have just concluded a successful nationalconsultation on strategies for development. We havealso embarked on a reconciliation effort to strengthenpeace and harmony in our multiracial society.Today I thank the Member States of the UnitedNations and the United Nations system for theirsupport and understanding during our period of crisis.They stood with us  with words of quietencouragement  and expressed confidence in our abilityto resolve our own difficulties. There were others whowere judgmental and strident. Their approach was nothelpful. We remind them of the founding principles ofthe United Nations: respect for national sovereigntyand non-interference in the internal affairs of MemberStates. Countries have the right to seek  and to put intoeffect  their own solutions to their problems.Not far from this site is the desolate and emptyspace of Ground Zero. It is a scar not only on the faceof this city; it is a scar on the world  a terrible reminderof an unspeakable act of horror. We in the Pacific shareAmerica's pain. We cannot feel it in all its intensity but we have a sense of the anguish and the anger. Ourthoughts and prayers have been with the American2people. We remember the innocents of so many racesand faiths whose blood was spilled by hate  includingthose killed in Kenya  Tanzania and other places  throughwanton acts of terrorism. Let it be known that the smallnations of the Pacific join the United Nations and allright-thinking countries in the fight against terrorism.In the Pacific Ocean  we are far from the world'scentres of power and areas of conflict and tension  butwe are very conscious that  today  no country is beyondthe reach of fanatics all too ready to kill and maim atrandom. The Pacific's response to the heightenedthreats of terrorism and transnational crime iscontained in the Nasonini Declaration on regionalsecurity. This was adopted at the recent meeting of thePacific Islands Forum  which I had the honour to chair.The Declaration binds the Pacific Islands Forum Statesto the implementation of internationally agreed anti-terrorism measures  such as Security Council resolution1373 (2001) and the special recommendations of theFinancial Action Task Force. Forum countries haveundertaken to introduce legislation and other measuresto combat terrorism and terrorist financing. We willsimilarly act against drug trafficking  people smugglingand money laundering  in accordance with workundertaken by such organizations as the United Nations.The summit of the African  Caribbean and PacificGroup of States (ACP) in Fiji in July lent the weight of78 States  with 650 million people  to the anti-terrorismcampaign. Its Nadi Declaration strongly condemnedthe 11 September attacks and terrorism in all its forms.ACP countries want terror to be fought politically legally and operationally and in keeping with theUnited Nations Charter. We made the point that theroot causes of terrorism  including poverty underdevelopment and oppression  must be treated.The member countries of the Pacific Islands Forumare heartened that at last there is an awakening to theimportance of the oceans. The international community isstarting to see that the conservation and sustainable use ofthe oceans are vital to the survival of the human race andthis planet. It was a significant achievement for us that thePlan of Implementation adopted at the World Summit onSustainable Development had a comprehensive sectionon oceans and numerous allied issues. The Summitspecifically recognized that oceans  islands and coastalareas are essential to the Earth's ecosystem and criticalto food security and the economic welfare of manydeveloping countries.While the island States are small in populationand area — in contrast to the billions who occupy thelarge land continents — we have something no otherinternational grouping possesses. Our Pacific heritagegives us sovereign authority over nearly one sixth of theEarth's surface. The Pacific has been described as the lastfrontier  its depths still largely unexplored  its totalresources unknown. This almost boundless body of watercontains great biological diversity  the most extensivecoral reefs in the world  seabed minerals and the largestsustainable tuna fishery. Humankind still does notknow what forms of natural energy it may produce.It is our responsibility  as people of the islands  toprotect and nurture the Pacific. We must do so not onlyfor ourselves  but for people everywhere. For the firsttime  we have adopted a regional ocean policy whichlays out the guiding principles for promoting thePacific as a maritime environment in support ofsustainable development. These principles are based oninternational law  reflected in the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea and otherinternational and regional agreements. The policy'sobjective is to improve our understanding of the Ocean maintain its health and ensure environmentally sounduse of its resources and riches. It also recognizes thatwe cannot take on this task alone and that we willtherefore need to develop partnerships and promotePacific cooperation.For Pacific islands peoples  the oceanenvironment is an integral part of their ethnic andcultural identity and way of life. It is because of theimportance of the sea and its resources to them that theyare so adamantly opposed to any action which exposes thePacific Ocean to pollution  hazardous waste and thedestructive effects of nuclear and missile tests.Recently  radioactive materials have been trans-shipped across the Pacific in arrogant defiance of ourprotests. We are told there is no risk  but when wepropose payment of compensation if there should be anaccident  there is instant rejection. The danger theseshipments pose to us is underscored by the disaster off thecoast of South Africa  where a freighter ran aground witha hold full of toxic chemicals. We read of a shipcarrying hazardous cargo on fire in waters off Britain.We do not want the Pacific put at risk in this way.We know too well the legacy of radioactivity fromnuclear-weapons testing. People in parts of the Pacificcontinue to suffer from the fallout. We are still waiting3for those who committed these acts to take fullresponsibility for what they have done.There are real hazards to low-lying atolls fromanother by-product of this era of environmental crisis.Rising sea levels caused by global warming will lead tothe disappearance of some islands. They will sinkbeneath the waves. Do not therefore be surprised if infuture environmental refugees from Oceania are forcedto seek sanctuary elsewhere.The world should also not be surprised at thestrong call from the Pacific for the adoption andratification of the Kyoto Protocol. We praise thosenations that have signified their intention to ratify. Tothose who have not done so  we pose the same questionwe asked in Johannesburg: Will you display thecourage  generosity and largeness of spirit the worldneeds from you? Will you join fully in saving the Earthfrom the gross abuse and destruction of its resources?We have done much in the Pacific to secure ourownership of the rich regional tuna fishery. Ten yearsof combined effort  negotiation  lobbying andpainstaking legal drafting led to the adoption of theUnited Nations Law of the Sea Convention in 1982.When it came into force  international law allowed usto lay claim to huge areas of marine-resourcejurisdiction through archipelagic regimes and 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zones. We establishedthe Forum Fisheries Agency to coordinate our efforts toget the best returns from valuable tuna stocks. There wasa successful conclusion to negotiations with America fora regional fisheries agreement. I pay tribute here to theUnited States for its willingness to reach an accord andfor agreeing to its extension to 2013.We still have much to do  however  to consolidateour position and to ensure that we bring an end toexploitation  which continues unabated. We areangered by the indiscriminate commercial exploitationof our tuna by distant-water fishing fleets. They haveno compunction about using purse seine methods anddrift nets  which take huge amounts of small tuna anddestroy other species. We call on those nations to actresponsibly and to stop this ruthless exploitation. Thereality is that more than 95 per cent of the annual valueof the South Pacific catch is taken by them. Wherearrangements for fees to be paid do apply  the return to theregion is less than 3 per cent of the annual commercialworth of the harvest. Obviously  we must redouble ourefforts to improve our ability to receive a fair share ofthese resources from harvesting and processing.The next step is to bring into effect the Westernand Central Pacific Tuna Convention. This willestablish a commission to secure long-termsustainability. The Convention recognizes that thestandards of other regions cannot be applied to us andthat our interests will be safeguarded against morepowerful and economically superior Powers.We very much welcomed the undertaking by anumber of countries in Johannesburg to permit quotaand tariff-free market access to the least developed ofthe developing countries. We urge them to extend thesame access conditions to developing island States. Weknow that free trade  as espoused by the World TradeOrganization  is the ideal. All nations will trade on thesame basis of equality and fairness  but what a largegap there is between the ideal and the reality. Thedeveloping countries hear huge amounts of free-marketrhetoric from the rich nations  but it is completelycancelled out by the reality of continuingprotectionism. There is no level playing field for thepoorer nations  only a steep and slippery slope. That iswhy we must move carefully into an integrated systemof world trade and allow special treatment for thosedeveloping countries that are especially vulnerable.It is in furtherance of this that I make a plea forthe acceptance of small island developing States as aspecial case for trade and aid assistance. This wouldbring them into line with the least developed andlandlocked developing countries.Next week will see the commencement of formalnegotiations between the European Union and theAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries on newpartnership arrangements under the CotonouAgreement. The ACP States look forward tostrengthening the partnership with the European Unionstarted under the Lomé Convention in 1975. It is alsotheir hope that the new economic partnershipagreements will incorporate commitments made by theEuropean Union member countries at Johannesburg.The United Nations was conceived to seek thebetterment of people and to foster security and peace inthe world. It has had its failures  and it still has itscritics. But let us not forget the successes and itsinfluence for good. Consider where we would bewithout the United Nations. We believe it has a4continuing role and a future  given the commitment ofthe membership to its governing principles.I am pleased to assure the Assembly that thePacific Island Forum and the Africa  Caribbean andPacific Group strongly support our Secretary-General'snew emphasis on preventive diplomacy. Conflictprevention and peace-building should continue to bethe central considerations in involvement by the UnitedNations in ongoing efforts to deal with conflict andcrisis situations in the Middle East and elsewhere.We congratulate the United Nations on thesuccess of its various peacekeeping operations. Fiji'sparticipation in the United Nations Interim Force inLebanon (UNIFIL)  after more than 24 years  willconclude in December this year. It has been a greathonour for us to serve the international cause of bringingpeace and order to that part of the Middle East.Fiji reaffirms its willingness to continue itsparticipation in United Nations and internationalpeacekeeping operations. All this has cost us dearly inlost lives  but it is a price we are willing to pay forinternational peace and security.We live in uncertain times. The world is troubled.We look to the United Nations to provide steadinessand balance at the centre. We look to it to maintainpeace on earth and hope for humanity. Membercountries of the Pacific Island Forum have committedthemselves to promoting and safeguarding the PacificOcean as a region of peace. We appeal to all those whoare part of our wider Pacific community to embrace theway of peace and to constructively engage incooperation for development. We welcome China'sincreasing presence and involvement in supporting andassisting development in our region. China and Taiwanhave longstanding differences. All of us in the Pacificwant to see them resolve their dispute amicablythrough dialogue and a common vision.We welcome the peace mission by the PrimeMinister of Japan to normalize relations with NorthKorea. We hope that his visit will also have the addedimpetus of encouraging North and South Korea tointensify their contacts and dialogue for a peacefulaccord between them.Japan  itself  is setting an example of how adeveloped nation can use its resources to help others.In Johannesburg  Japan was more forthcoming thanmost affluent countries in its willingness to act on theSummit agenda and decisions. It is already playing avery positive role in the South Pacific.Fiji reiterates its support for Japan as a permanentmember of the Security Council  along with China.In concluding  let me reaffirm that  in a worldstill threatened by conflict and war  the Pacific IslandForum and the ACP Group stand firmly for peace. Wesay the best way of securing that and protecting ourprecious planet is to uphold the multilateralismrepresented by the United Nations and its family ofnations. For peace to endure  the United Nations mustcontinue to ensure that development and opportunitiesfor economic and social progress are spread and sharedevenly among all its Member States.At Johannesburg  we all agreed to promotepartnerships to assist developing countries in dealingmore effectively with the basic needs of their peoples.From our experience with our trade and developmentpartnerships  with Australia and New Zealand and withthe European Union  the Pacific Islands and ACPcountries commit themselves to working closely withthe United Nations system and other multilateralorganizations  like the World Trade Organization  inpromoting similar partnerships with other developedcountries."
"59",2429,"FRA",57,2002,"﻿I wish at the outset to pay tribute to theremarkable work of the Secretary-General  who through his outstanding personal qualities and sense ofdialogue  gives our Organization unparalleledinfluence. I congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I also congratulate Switzerland on itsadmission to our Organization  and Timor-Leste on itsforthcoming admission.A year ago  to our stunned horror  New York andWashington were struck in unprecedented attacks.From now on no one now can disregard the dark sideof the world: international terrorism that combinesarchaism with technology  and shifting underground28criminal networks with a growing risk of theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.These formidable opponents insinuate themselvesinto the heart of the world's complexity. They play onfrustrations and resentment  hatred and fears. They foilour plans; they know how to find weak spots and turnour weapons against us. No  the world is definitely notsuffering from an excess of power. To the contrary  it issuddenly discovering its extreme vulnerability.Faced with these threats  the temptation to forgeblindly ahead could emerge. That would be a seriousmistake. Force cannot be the sole response to theseelusive adversaries that are constantly changing.The example of Afghanistan shows this.Mobilizing the international community enabled us tooverthrow a retrograde totalitarian regime thatharboured and supported the Al Qaeda network anddealt a harsh blow to terrorist infrastructures. That wasnecessary  but it is not enough. We must now rebuild;we must help the Afghan people  maintain our effortsover the long term  and continue our work to bringabout stability and democracy  but also to dismantle thedrug economy and the trafficking it fuels.The fact that force alone is often futile is one ofthe characteristics of our age. We live in a world that isinterdependent  where cause and effect may be distant indirect and unpredictable. Let us take care that ourinterventions do not give rise to new frustrations produce new imbalances or spark fires that we cannotput out.The case of Iraq is typical of this new situation. Itis a country that has defied the authority of the SecurityCouncil and flouted international law for years. It is aregime that poses a grave threat to security  particularlythe security of the peoples of its region  because of therisk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Itsconduct is the direct cause of the great sufferingendured by its people.Is the international community concerned? Ofcourse it is. Can it continue to tolerate this situation?Definitely not. Should it act? Obviously: the status quocannot go on. France's determination to obtaincompliance with the law is absolute.We must act  but we must do so effectively. Wemust act  but without risking results opposite to thosewe seek. We must take care not to exacerbate asituation that is already very disturbing. We must act but there are many traps. Intervention that is politicallyor legally ill-defined or poorly mounted would notgarner the broad support necessary; it might galvanizepublic opinion in the region against it  and the regimein Baghdad  which is isolated now  could benefit;lastly  it might exacerbate tension in the Middle Eastand beyond at a time when we should  on the contrary redouble our efforts to return to the path of dialogueand peace.How are these traps to be avoided? How are we tosucceed? There is only one way  and it is demanding. Itis the path of responsibility  collective responsibility.The world now is one of interdependence. Its stabilityconcerns us all. All of us must contribute to it.The necessary measures must be adopted by theinternational community after in-depth and transparentconsideration. Any temptation to engage in unilateralpreventive action would be dangerous. We must takecare to avoid any suspicion of bias or injustice. This isthe only way to ensure that any action to enforce lawand restore security does not add to insecurity. That isthe best guarantee of effectiveness.That is why  in the case of Iraq  France advocatesa dÈmarche made completely legitimate by collectivedeliberation. It requires two successive steps. First  wemust together reaffirm the need for United Nationsinspectors to return and demand that Iraq comply atlast with its obligations under the Security Councildecisions taken since 1991  and do so according to adefinite timetable. That is the objective of theinternational community. It is also in Iraq's interest. IfBaghdad persists in its refusal to allow the inspectorsto return unconditionally  then there must beconsequences. The Security Council should then decideon the measures to be taken without excluding anyoption. Responsibilities would be clarified. The worldmust be able to act. But it must also be coherent andeffective  in a sustained way. That is today the realchallenge to our values  and to our democracies.I recently travelled to the Middle East  theBalkans and Afghanistan. I realized the strength of theaspirations and hopes for peace. But I also saw how theefforts and energies of various parties need to be unitedand centred on a collective ambition.No Power can today assume sole responsibilityfor world equilibrium. The world aspires to bestructured around poles of stability and progress. Inaddition to the United States  the European Union is29naturally destined to form one such pole  along withRussia  China  Japan and India  among others. In futureeach actor must make its contribution to the effort. It isa common project that we must build.That is the ambition that inspires the EuropeanUnion  and France's action within it. The Union affirmsits role on the world stage in the service of peace andprosperity. It is acquiring the appropriate diplomaticand defence instruments. With a view to majorenlargement  the Union is also committed to genuinelyre-making its design. That is the purpose of theConvention on the Future of Europe  guided by theprinciples of democracy and effectiveness for a futureEurope. In that way  the Union will contribute to thestability of the continent and beyond. Finally  theEuropean model reconciles in a unique way therequirements of social cohesion and economicperformance to further a common plan  whilerespecting the diversity of all. For all those reasons  Iam convinced that Europe's voice offers elements foraddressing the major challenges of our time.Today  power in all its aspects must be shared. Itis essential to listen to diverse approaches and points ofview. A dialogue among cultures is essential. Only thiswill enable us to understand the main issues today bytaking into account the history and aspirations of everypeople and every country. Only this can prevent usfrom having too narrow a conception of the worldbased on ignorance and on fear of the other. Only thiscan guide us in putting humankind back at the centre ofour concerns and at the heart of our action and ourshared commitment.Sharing means responding to the requirement ofsolidarity. Extreme poverty  famine  epidemics andfinancial crises are factors contributing to disorder andfomenting instability. Terrorism feeds on these things.Generosity must be the corollary of power. It is ourpolitical and moral duty. It is also in our own interest.Accordingly  France has pledged to augment itsdevelopment assistance  which will increase by 50 percent over the next five years.Owing to its geographic proximity and historicaland cultural ties  my country has a deep friendship forAfrica. It feels a special responsibility. That continent more than others  needs the solidarity of theinternational community in the difficult trials it isexperiencing: the too-numerous conflicts that persist;the return of the spectre of famine; the economicdifficulties; and the tragedy of AIDS  which todaystrikes nearly 30 million Africans.Yet Africa is rich in potential  rich in theenthusiasm of its young people and in the energy of itscivil society  and rich in memory  in tradition and in atreasury of wisdom from which we all have much tolearn. Important efforts are under way today to advancehuman rights  democracy  the fight against corruption and favourable economic and social policies for strongand balanced growth. The establishment of the NewPartnership for Africa's Development attests to thecontinent's willingness to take charge of itsdevelopment  in the context of a renewed partnershipwith the industrialized countries. Let us recognize andsupport those efforts.In particular  we must help Africa to moveforward on the path of conflict resolution in SierraLeone  Liberia  Eritrea  Ethiopia  and the Sudan. Thosetragedies concern us all  because today there are nomore localized crises. Instability spreads. Theinternational community must mobilize.In the Great Lakes region  the agreements signedat Lusaka  Pretoria and Luanda must be implemented.They must lead to the withdrawal of all foreign troopspresent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  tothe disarmament of foreign armed groups  toreconciliation and to a return to peace.With regard to Western Sahara  it is good that theSecurity Council  in its most recent resolution resolution 1429 (2002)  gave Mr. James Baker the timeto work to bring the parties closer together. That timemust be used to make progress.We must stay engaged in the Balkans  where theprogress made this year must be consolidated inKosovo  in the former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Linkingthe Balkans to Europe through the rule of law anddemocracy is  more than ever before  our commonaspiration.In the Middle East  we must emerge from theimpasse and restore hope. The situation will worsen aslong as the parties remain prisoners to the logic ofviolence. There is urgency to act. The PalestinianAuthority must use all available means to prevent andcurb terrorist actions. With a view to the creation of anindependent  viable and democratic Palestinian State 30based on the 1967 borders  it must pursue its reforms particularly in the institutional context.For its part  the State of Israel  while itlegitimately wishes to defend itself against terrorism must do so with respect for international law. Thesecurity imperative cannot by itself take the place ofpolicy. Settlement-building must cease  and the Israeliarmed forces must withdraw from the occupiedterritories  as demanded by the Security Council.Measures must be taken quickly to improve the nowalarming humanitarian and social situation of thePalestinian people.On the basis of Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and 1397 (2002) and the principleof land for peace  which all the Arab countries meeting in Beirut  agreed to recognize at the initiativeof Saudi Arabia  the political process must berelaunched with the aid of the `quartet'. We supportthe convening of an international conference at an earlydate. The objective must be a just  comprehensive andlasting peace; a peace based on the coexistence of twoStates within secure and recognized borders guaranteeing security for the Israelis and offering thePalestinians a normal life with dignity; a peace basedon a comprehensive settlement of the regional conflictbetween Israel and its neighbours.The attention that we pay to regional crises mustnot distract us from the responsibility that we mustassume in the face of global challenges. The UnitedNations is playing its full role in the fight againstterrorism. Let us do likewise in the other greatstruggles of our time.Let us fight tirelessly against the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and their means ofdelivery. The President of the French Republic hasproposed that the Security Council meet at the highestlevel in 2003  during the General Assembly  with adouble mandate: to review non-proliferation policy andto give it a new impetus.Let us mobilize all actors for sustainabledevelopment in a renewed partnership  in conformitywith the commitments made at Doha  Monterrey andJohannesburg. The time has come to strengthenconcrete cooperation to permit access by all to basicresources such as water and energy  to basic socialservices such as education and health  and to foodsecurity. Let us also call for the ratification and fullimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol on climatechange.Let us establish true global governance ofsustainable development and give it the necessarycoherence. France proposes the creation of aneconomic and social security council and of a worldenvironmental organization to give all countries especially those of the South  the possibility ofmaking their voices heard on those issues.Finally  let us fully exercise our responsibility todefend and promote human rights. These are universal.Progress  often fragile  must be encouraged. Violations often so numerous  must be punished.Let us strengthen the authority and theuniversality of the International Criminal Court toenable it to ensure that the most serious crimes at theinternational level do not go unpunished. This new toolis essential to build a more just and democratic worldwhere the principle of responsibility is fully respected.Through ambitious conventions  let us providebetter protection  as we did for children  for thedisabled and for the victims of forced disappearanceand torture. Let us fight against corruption. Let uscommit ourselves to the negotiation of a universalconvention against human cloning for reproductivepurposes  as proposed by France and Germany.Yes  the principle of collective responsibility is atthe heart of the international system. It is at the heart ofUnited Nations action. In order to play its full role  theOrganization must pursue its reforms. In particular  wemust increase the representativity of the SecurityCouncil by enlarging both categories of membership.France supports the aspirations of Germany  Japan andIndia in particular.The United Nations is the keystone of the worldorder. The generous and strong ideas that presided overits birth  just after a world conflict that pushed thelimits of barbarism to the unspeakable  retain all theircurrency. The contemporary world is complex confusing and unpredictable. It is urgent that we forgeamong nations a new alliance  a community of destiny.That is our future; that is our chance. Through ouractions  let us respond to the expectations of theworld's peoples."
"60",2454,"FSM",57,2002,"﻿I would like to take thisopportunity to congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourelection. My Government hails the selection of a leaderwith such esteemed qualifications  and we areconfident you will lead the work of this body in thesame distinguished manner as that of your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic ofKorea.The tragic events just over one year ago in thisgreat city and elsewhere in the United States havetransformed the nature of life throughout the world reaching the farthest corners of the planet. My country far removed from the devastation of that fateful day inSeptember 2001  reaffirms its full support for theefforts to bring those responsible to justice. Morebroadly  we extend our unwavering support for allmeasures necessary to combat terrorism and one day we hope  to eliminate it.We in the Federated States of Micronesia aredoing our part to work towards a more effective globalantiterrorism network by putting in place measures tointerdict the movement of terrorists and their fundsthrough our region. We look forward to the workplanned in that regard for this session of the GeneralAssembly.The meetings of the Pacific Islands Forum thisyear were dominated by security considerations in thewake of those events. We note with full support theNasonini Declaration  which enhances existing regionalsecurity measures. Likewise  speaking as Chairman ofthe Standing Committee of the Pacific IslandsConference of Leaders  I am confident in saying thatevery island leader is personally committed to seeingthat our region serves no useful purpose for the darkforces of terrorism.The realm of international security has seenfundamental and beneficial change in the past year.Sadly  the same is not true for most other primaryissues on our agenda  notably the elimination ofpoverty and stemming the tide of environmentaldegradation.On those issues  as a developing country  weshare the concerns and positions of other developingcountries. We have all made powerful statements andset lofty goals through the Rio Declaration 10 yearsago  the Millennium Declaration two years ago and most recently  the Monterrey Consensus and theJohannesburg Declaration. Of special interest to mydelegation  I would note that the same holds for theDeclaration of Barbados on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. Yet itis true that progress has been slow in addressing theneeds of the world's poor. Likewise  10 years after theRio Summit  the quality of our environment and itsability to sustain future generations still diminishesdaily.At the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  held in Johannesburg  the FederatedStates of Micronesia joined the other Pacific Islandcountries in proposing a number of umbrella initiativesthat provide a framework for partnerships withdeveloped countries to assist us in implementingsustainable development. Those initiatives reflect ourcommon concerns but recognize the uniqueness of eachof our island nations. We hope that those practicalproposals will help to turn decades of pronouncementsinto action. We are encouraged that some of our Pacificneighbours  such as New Zealand and Australia  havealready come forward with specific partnershipproposals  and we look forward to the support of the17United Nations system as well. Such developmentsconvince us that Johannesburg will be remembered as alandmark on our long journey.We appreciate the international community'sdecision to hold the next Barbados review conferencein 2004  and we look forward to adopting concretegoals and timetables at the international level by thattime.Development and the environment are inexorablylinked. That truth has been reaffirmed in each of theseDeclarations. We all know that there cannot besustainable development without environmentalprotection  and there cannot be environmentalprotection without sustainable development. Nor canthe world hope to support 6 billion people at the levelof consumption we now see in the developed world.The future will require sacrifice: sacrifice on the partof the North  to adopt more sustainable living practices and by the South  which must recognize that the pastdevelopment paths followed by the North unfortunatelydo not lead to a sustainable future.It is this body  above all others  that will grapplewith those painful realities. We must realize that theypresent issues even more complex than some of ourmore familiar geopolitical concerns.Among other things  new attention must be givento the reform of the United Nations  because we mustaddress more than just structural adjustments in therepresentational format of our body. This reform musttake due account that the entire world is reassessingour accustomed ways of living. Still  there must be astart. First and foremost  we call on all nations to givefresh consideration to reform of the Security Council tobetter reflect today's realities. In that regard  wereiterate our support for permanent seats for Japan andGermany and for a system that ensures more equitablerepresentation by developing countries.The Federated States of Micronesia is engaged onall issues before this body that affect us. But  given ourunique circumstances  we have no choice but to placetop priority on protection of the oceans and the climate.Global ocean policy has been a bright spot in recentyears  particularly as it relates to the Pacific. Pacificisland Governments recently concluded work on aregional ocean policy  and they have developed anumber of positive new initiatives on fisheries andother related matters. Yet those positiveaccomplishments in ocean policy are threatened bycontinued violation of our sovereignty in the form ofillegal fishing and trans-shipment of hazardousmaterials.Only a few weeks ago  in defiance ofinternational obligations  several of the world's largestindustrial powers collaborated once again in yetanother extremely dangerous shipment of radioactivematerial through our region. Without prior notice orassurance of compensation for damage  this shipmentpassed within 30 miles of the capital of the FederatedStates of Micronesia. Our expressed objections to thisviolation of our exclusive economic zone were flatlyignored. Effective regulation of ocean-based trans-shipment of these dangerous materials must find itsway into the priorities of this body.Similarly  with regard to climate change  wewelcome the positive accomplishments in thenegotiating arena under the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change  most notably theKyoto Protocol. We applaud those nations that havejoined us in ratifying the Protocol  and we welcomewith anticipation its imminent entry into force. But thesad reality is that 10 years have passed since theFramework Convention became effective  10 moreyears of damage to the earth's climate.A handful of countries have succeeded incontinuing to stall progress in the reduction of globalgreenhouse gas emissions. Again I ask these nations  asI have on each occasion when I have appeared beforethis body  to reconsider their policies and to recognizethe international implications of their inaction.I call upon those nations to remember the wisewords of United States President Franklin D.Roosevelt  who said that`liberty does not permit an individual citizen orgroup of citizens to commit acts of depredationagainst nature in such a way as to harm theirneighbours  and especially to harm futuregenerations of Americans.'Let us not lose sight of the fact that there is nowuniversal recognition of the reality of the problem ofclimate change and its causes. In the light of thatrecognition  it is not enough that most nations arewilling to take action. All must work together todevelop effective mitigation strategies to preventfurther damage  and to define and implementadaptation measures for the most vulnerable.18We have just over 100 000 citizens in theFederated States of Micronesia. We have no naturalsources of fossil fuel. We have become far toodependent on imports of fossil fuels during the pasthalf-century; even so  our contribution to globalemissions of greenhouse gases is negligible. Lookingto the future  we have committed to a reduction andeventual elimination of fossil fuel for energyproduction. But we must rely on Western technologiesif we are to move in the direction of renewable sourcesof energy. Thus  we are disturbed by the policies ofdeveloped countries that give little more than lipservice to development of renewable energytechnologies.We are alarmed at the continuing refusal of somenations even to begin to acknowledge the nature of theclimate problem  let alone to take progressive action tofight it. Also distressing is the fact that  at the sametime  some of those nations are reducing their aidpresence in developing countries. Some feel that  justwhen the need is greatest  the world community isclosing in upon itself  in a cocoon of self-interest.It is inconceivable to us that global champions ofequity and democratic ideals  nations whoseprinciples we seek to emulate  could assume aposition on the most crucial social issues of our timethat succumbs to private interests. These privateinterests  for obvious reasons  insist that  to the extentany problem exists  it can be addressed in good time on a voluntary basis. My people find it very difficult toreconcile such private influences with the principlesthose nations promote.This fifty-seventh session provides a genuineopportunity for the world community as a whole totake note of our recent conferences  to seize theinitiative and to set a course towards tangible progresson the issues we all agree to be of common concern.In conclusion  our deepest sympathies areextended to the victims of war  terrorism  politicalinjustice  environmental degradation and economicwant throughout the world. We hope and pray that ouractions here might  in ways large and small  lead to abetter world for them and for us all.The Federated States of Micronesia is a smallforce within the community of nations. Nevertheless we pledge our full assistance and cooperation towardsthe attainment of this goal. We take to heart the wordsof British statesman Sir Francis Bacon  who once said:`He makes the greatest mistake who decides to donothing because he can do so little.'"
"61",2497,"GAB",57,2002,"﻿Gabon ispleased to see Mr. Kavan presiding over the work ofthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly which is being held at a time when the need tostrengthen international cooperation to resolve theworld's problems is indeed vital. His election is arecognition by the international community of the rolethat his country  the Czech Republic  plays in thepromotion of freedom and peace.To his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  weexpress our satisfaction at the excellent job he did asPresident of the General Assembly at the previoussession.To Secretary-General Kofi Annan  we convey ourgratitude and support for his forceful work on behalf ofinternational peace and security.Gabon welcomes the admission of the SwissConfederation and the imminent accession of theDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste to membership ofthe United Nations. They swell the ranks of ourillustrious United Nations family  confirming itsuniversality.I should like to pursue my statement by evokingthe metaphor of the river. Each wave lapping the bankshas its own character  but they all call from the sameriver. They express multiplicity in consistency. Thesame can be said of our annual sessions. This session isa new wave in the mighty river of the United Nations  anew cycle in the global rhythm of the world. Today many of us feel hope tinged with scepticism.Two years ago  in September 2000  we held theMillennium Summit in this very Hall. It was certainlythe point of departure of a new global movementtowards more peace  prosperity  justice and humanism.At the very moment when we imagined ourselves tohave taken a great step forward towards the building ofa better world for all  we were stunned on 11September 2001 by the ghastly terrorist attacksperpetrated here on American soil. Those attacks ofviolence  which we all condemned  eclipsed ourdreams and reminded us of the beast lurking withineach of us.Gabon was one of the very first nations to commititself to implementing the provisions of SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) by taking legal actionto prevent and combat terrorism. Although significant progress made since then under the auspices of theSecurity Council in the campaign against internationalterrorism needs to be strengthened. That is why17negotiations on a draft general convention oninternational terrorism must go on with a view to itsspeedy adoption. In the same spirit  the conclusion ofongoing discussions on a convention on thesuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism willsupplement the international anti-terrorism legalframework.The cloud of uncertainty looming over ourcollective security is darkened by the Israel-Palestiniancrisis. It is regrettable to note that renewed violence inthe Middle East is calling all previous efforts intoquestion. The international community must mobilizeto rekindle the flame of peace in that region  which hasbeen beset by ceaseless violence for decades. Gabonencourages both sides to resume dialogue andnegotiation with a view to implementing the relevantresolutions of the Security Council  in particularresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which stress theneed for the coexistence of the Palestinian State withthe State of Israel  with respect for secure andinternationally recognized borders.Similarly  Gabon hopes that the current talksbetween the two Koreas will help allay tensionsbetween the two countries.Positive developments in the overall situation inAfrica attest to the continent's gradual return to thepath of peace  stability and unity. Fratricidal conflictsare increasingly giving way to the emergence of anAfrican awareness marked by the determination to seethe ideals of peace prevail and to devote ourselves todevelopment. This wave of hope has been justified byrecent developments  particularly in the Great Lakesregion. We are convinced that this progress will giveimpetus to the peace process in that region.Accordingly  we believe that it is time to convene aninternational conference on the region in order toconsolidate peace there.However  the progress that has been made inresolving conflicts in Africa should not blind us to thesituations in Angola  Liberia  the Central AfricanRepublic and Guinea-Bissau  which  having beendestabilized by years of conflict  are now facingenormous difficulties  particularly in the humanitarianarea  in restoring domestic peace and security. Theinternational community must lend its support to theeconomic and social recovery efforts of those countriesso as to prevent them from being caught up yet again inthe spiral of violence.The world's economic and social situation isdisquieting. The commitments that we undertook at theMillennium Summit  and which were reiterated at theMonterrey International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  have yet to bear fruit. Globalization which we thought would permit the harmoniousintegration of all countries into the internationalcommunity through the process of trade liberalization has not yet attained the hoped-for results. On thecontrary  we see that there has been an increase insocial inequality and a widening gap betweenindustrialized and developing countries.Efforts by developing countries  particularly inthe areas of consolidating democracy  the rule of law good governance  the fight against poverty and therational protection and management of theenvironment  are still not being matched by thedeveloped countries  as attested to by the continueddiminution of external resources for development andthe drop in foreign investment. One must add to thatthe growth of conditionalities and other barriers thatcould keep those countries in a state of permanenteconomic and social stagnation.Among the elements contributing to that state ofaffairs is the heavy burden of debt. In fact  severaldeveloping countries  including Gabon  devote almosthalf of their budgetary resources to repayment of debt while at the same time they must find solutions to themany problems that inhibit their development. We havethe firm conviction that  by reducing the indebtednessof our countries to a sustainable level  we can allocatemore resources to priorities such as universal educationand health  housing  poverty reduction andenvironmental management. We hope that the promisemade by the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund to extend the current debt reliefmechanisms to other developing countries — includingthose with intermediate incomes  such as Gabon —will quickly become reality.In order to respond to those concerns  Africa hasestablished the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD). NEPAD is a true developmentprogramme based on good governance  respect forhuman rights and the strengthening of democracy peace and security  which are preconditions for theeconomic recovery of the continent. That programmecalls on the international community for effectivesupport. Members can easily understand why theAfrican countries place much hope in the debate that18the General Assembly will devote to NEPADtomorrow  16 September  in which the President ofGabon will take part.Malaria and  above all  HIV/AIDS are majorobstacles to Africa's development that could ultimatelydeprive the continent of much of its human potential.We are pleased that the First Ladies of Africa haveunderstood the gravity of this problem by creating  inpartnership with the Joint United Nations Programmeon HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)  an organization to combatmalaria and the HIV/AIDS pandemic  called theOrganization of the First Ladies of Africa against HIV/AIDS. We are convinced that this newstructure — headed by the First Lady of Gabon Ms. Edith Lucie Bongo  whose self-sacrifice anddynamism are well known — will complement theefforts of African States in combating this scourge. Wealso expect strong action from the internationalcommunity to accompany our efforts in the fightagainst the pandemic.The preservation of global ecosystems is anothersubject of concern for the world. Only a few weeksago  heads of State or Government met atJohannesburg  South Africa  for the World Summit onSustainable Development. Despite the momentum itgenerated  the Summit did not reduce the risks thatweigh on our environment. We think that  in view ofthe lack of progress in implementing therecommendations of environmental conferencesorganized over the past decade  it is becomingincreasingly urgent that States implement Agenda 21and the other relevant international instruments.Gabon  for its part  has just created a zone ofnational parks that covers 10 per cent of our nationalterritory. Those protected areas are proof of ourcontribution to the process of preserving globalecological balance in general and to the managementand conservation of Africa's massive tropical forest inparticular. That is why we welcome the launching inJohannesburg  by United States Secretary of StateColin Powell  of the initiative to preserve the flora andfauna of the countries of the Congo river basin.Positive trends in the world can be guaranteedonly in an institutional environment bearing the seal ofuniversality. The United Nations  in our view embodies such an environment  where there must betrue multilateral cooperation  based on justice  equality solidarity and the participation of all. It is evident that in order to be a global centre for interaction and debate the United Nations needs reforms. Those reforms  forwhich we have been calling for several years  areunavoidable if we wish to see the continued existenceof the United Nations  whose membership hasincreased constantly since its creation in 1945. Reformof the Organization must be based on a reaffirmation ofthe purposes and principles of the Charter  primaryamong which are international peace and security.The International Court of Justice  in a 1949advisory opinion concerning certain expenditures ofthe United Nations  stated that it was natural to givetop priority to international peace and security  becausethe other purposes could not be attained unless thatfundamental condition were met. International peaceand security are the preconditions for development which in turn is a way to create the stability and well-being that are necessary to guarantee peaceful andfriendly relations among nations.The United Nations is the property of humanity. Itwas born out of awareness of the horrors of the SecondWorld War  in which all peoples participated  includingAfricans. We wish to see Africa play a more importantrole in the Organization  particularly in the SecurityCouncil  by being given at least one permanent seatwith the same privileges as the other members with thesame status. Furthermore  Africa has been recognizedby the United Nations as a top priority  and we areconvinced that the creation of a Secretariat officeconcerned exclusively with African issues wouldremedy the shortcomings we have seen in theimplementation of previous programmes devoted toAfrica  such as the United Nations Programme for theEconomic Redressing and Development of Africa andthe United Nations New Agenda for the Developmentof Africa in the 1990s.Our collective action for development will not betruly effective unless we use dialogue and cooperationas tools for global solidarity based on the promotion ofpartnerships. Today or never  we must reaffirm that weall belong to the one and only human race and definethe new contours of our collective destiny. We can thusdraw from our shared river  the United Nations  theresources that will enable us to build  with hope andconfidence  a better world for everyone."
"62",2544,"GBR",57,2002,"﻿In an imperfectworld  our citizens need the United Nations as theyhave never needed it before. The United Nations hasnot resolved all conflicts by peaceful means  nor couldit. The authority of the United Nations has to beunderpinned by the force of arms. But the remarkableachievement of this body has been to make the finelanguage of its Charter a force for good beyond justwords; by this the United Nations has raised the baragainst the illegitimate use of violence  by States andnow by terrorists. In doing so  the United Nations hassaved lives by the million and saved millions morefrom fear  poverty and tyranny.Without the United Nations  there could havebeen no salvation for the people of East Timor  noprospect of lasting peace in Sierra Leone  no one tohelp rebuild Afghanistan. Forty years ago  PresidentJohn F. Kennedy predicted a world in which 25 Stateswould have nuclear weapons. But the Non-Proliferation Treaty  supported by internationalsafeguards  has ensured that this nightmare scenariohas failed to materialize.All this should serve to remind us of the criticalrole which the United Nations has to play in worldaffairs  under its excellent Secretary-General  KofiAnnan. It is the responsibility of all of us here in theAssembly to ensure that the legitimacy  the authorityand the capacity of the United Nations to preservepeace and to help build prosperity is strengthened andnot undermined.Today  alongside the traditional threats to globalpeace and security  the United Nations and the worldcommunity face three rising challenges: failing States terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.The world saw in Afghanistan the graphicdangers of State failure  where order breaks down  lawis undermined and anarchy takes over. We in theinternational community must accept our share of theblame for allowing that country to disintegrate. AlQaeda and their evil creed were only too willing to takeadvantage. But we delude ourselves if we believe thatthe chaos in Afghanistan over much of the last decadeis unique. In too many areas of the world  our fellowcitizens are forced to live under the rule of gangs without the security and freedoms which we all shouldbe able to take for granted.If we are serious about the concept of aninternational community  then  as Members of theUnited Nations  we must accept our responsibility tohelp prevent States from failing and to restore orderwhere States have already collapsed.The United Kingdom's own experience inAfghanistan  as the International Security Assistance12Force (ISAF) lead nation  working with the UnitedNations  shows what can be done; but we all know thatmuch more needs to be done. We need a much morestructured and methodical approach to this growingproblem of failed and failing States.But the tools are there. At Monterrey in Marchand at Johannesburg earlier this month  the worldcommunity has built on the Millennium DevelopmentGoals to reduce poverty among the world's mostdisadvantaged people. We are backing this commitmentwith action. Between 1996 and 2006 the UnitedKingdom will have doubled its development assistance.Together with the Doha Round of the WorldTrade Organization (WTO)  we have within our grasp anew era of sustainable economic growth and prosperity a stable political future for the developing world and amuch more secure global environment.But people cannot be freed from poverty unlessthey are also free from fear. Security is not an option; itis a necessity. Three years ago over half of SierraLeone was under the control of rebels; over half thepopulation was displaced; countless civilians had beenmurdered  abducted or horribly mutilated; a spiral ofsickness and hunger was taking over. Now  thanks toUnited Nations and British intervention to end thatdecade-long civil war  people are returning home andrebuilding their shattered lives. But long-termcommitment is necessary in situations like that.As we found in Afghanistan  when we deal withfailing States  we have to tackle the second challengeto international law and justice — that of globalterrorism — as well.All the nations of the world  and all its people —black  white  Buddhist  Christian  Jew  Muslim  Hinduand Sikh — have a common interest in defeatingterrorism. There must be no hiding places for terrorismor for terrorists; no hiding places for their money; andno semantic hiding places either. The distinction someclaim between terrorists and freedom-fighters is falseand dangerous. Their victims enjoy no such distinction.There must be no such distinctions either ininternational law.Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) creatednew obligations on all of us. The United Kingdom hasbeen honoured to chair the Counter-TerrorismCommittee. There has been an overwhelminglypositive response. But  as we recall those who lost theirlives on 11 September last year  we cannot relax ourcollective determination.Alongside the threats from failing States andfrom terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction poses the greatest current threat to globalsecurity  and nowhere is the case for universal supportfor the enforcement of United Nations law strongerthan in the field of weapons of mass destruction.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons  the Chemical Weapons Convention and theBiological and Toxin Weapons Convention compriseone of the world's most significant bodies ofinternational law. For the past three decades  thiscorpus of law has ensured — with one infamousexception — that no States have resorted to these  theworld's worst weapons.That exception is Iraq. For two decades  SaddamHussein's regime has defied and frustrated everyattempt to enforce the international rule of law. Iraq isthe only country to be condemned by the UnitedNations for breaching the Convention on ChemicalWeapons. Iraq has fought wars of aggression againsttwo neighbours  and has launched missile attacksagainst five countries in the region. Iraq has usedpoison gas against its own people. Saddam Hussein haspersistently mocked the authority of the UnitedNations. No country has deceived every other countryin the world as systematically and cynically as Iraq.And no country presents as fundamental a challenge tothe United Nations as Iraq.Every society  from the smallest village to theglobal community represented here in the GeneralAssembly  must have rules  and every member of thatcommunity must accept responsibility for respectingand maintaining those rules. Without this  the veryconcept of community breaks down. So those of uswho believe in an active international communitycannot stand by and do nothing while Iraq continues todefy the will of the United Nations. All of us whobelieve in the United Nations have to make up ourminds now about how to deal with Iraq. The authorityof the United Nations itself is at stake.We cannot let Iraq do grave damage to thisOrganization and the international order which itrepresents. We cannot let Iraq go on defying a decadeof Security Council resolutions. If we do  we will findthat our resolutions are dismissed by aggressorseverywhere as mere words. We have spent 57 years13building this Organization beyond a talking shop. Wecannot now let that work be undone.There are times when hard choices have to bemade. On Iraq  we have now reached such a moment. Ifwe fail to deal with this challenge  the United Nationsitself will be seriously weakened. And that would makethe world a much more dangerous place.As President Bush spelled out in his powerfulspeech to the Assembly here on Thursday  we have tobe resolute in the face of Iraq's defiance and secure thewill of the United Nations. We must require Iraq to re-admit inspectors  with unfettered access. We have notjust an interest but a responsibility to ensure that Iraqcomplies fully with international law. We have to beclear to Iraq and to ourselves about the consequenceswhich will flow from a failure by Iraq to meet itsobligations.And yes  in dealing with the threat posed by Iraqwe must also tackle those other internationalchallenges outlined so eloquently by Kofi Annan in hisaddress.Over the past year we have seen a furtherdeterioration in security in Israel and in the occupiedterritories. There has never been a greater need forinternational involvement in the Middle East peaceprocess to secure the outcome we all want to see: twoStates  Israel and Palestine living side by side withinsecure and recognized borders  based on SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 1397(2002).In Kashmir  we should continue to urge bothIndia and Pakistan to act with restraint  and to seek toresolve that long-running conflict.At the end of the cold war we had all hoped thatfuture generations would be able to enjoy a worldwhere cooperation rather than conflict was thehallmark of international affairs. That goal is stillwithin reach  if we are united in tackling State failure in the war against terrorism and in confronting thosethreats of weapons of mass destruction.The tasks facing the founders of this institutionwere no less intimidating. Yet their combination ofhigh values and hard-headed realism created thegreatest instrument in history for the avoidance of war.Our founders' achievement has been formidable. Butthe Organization now faces new and emerging threats.We have to confront those threats and be ever alive tothe challenges which are out there to peace and justiceacross the world. All of us who believe in thoseprinciples of international law and justice have a dutyto ensure that they are both upheld and enforced."
"63",2568,"GEO",57,2002,"Allow me tobegin by extending my warmest congratulations toyou –– my colleague Mr. Jan Kavan — on his electionas President of the fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly.I cannot but remember the tragedy of 11September 2001  the anniversary of which wecommemorated just a few days ago. That bloody actcommitted here in New York  the host city of theUnited Nations Headquarters  was directed not onlyagainst the United States but also against all the rest ofus  the entire civilized world that the United Nationssymbolizes. Georgia has been part of the anti-terroristcoalition from the very first day. I would like to assurethe Assembly that Georgia has been doing everythingin its power to be a dedicated partner in this struggleand that it will maintain the spirit of cooperation untilthe very  successful end.The problem of international terrorism is complexand multidimensional  and I had intended to share ourviews and thoughts on that. However  the recentcomplications in Georgian-Russian relations havecompelled me to shift the focus of my address. I amreferring to the mounting aggressive attacks on mycountry's sovereignty emanating from the Russianauthorities and media. On a daily basis  Georgia isbeing accused of harbouring terrorists  aiding fightersand fueling the conflict in Chechnya. This is a clearattempt to create an enemy image of Georgia inRussia's public opinion. Here I have to state clearly:this is utter nonsense.We believe that the pressure exerted on mycountry under the pretext of these absurd accusations isbeing used by Russia as a smokescreen to hide its ownfailure to cope with the conflict in Chechnya. AsPresident Shevardnadze stated in his letter  transmittedby our Permanent Representative in identical lettersaddressed to the Secretary-General and to the Presidentof the Security Council  “It is hard to imagine a clearerexample of confusing the cause and the effect”.(A/57/408  annex)The truth is that this tragic chain of events startedwith the conflict in Abkhazia  Georgia  in whichChechen fighters  citizens of the Russia Federation had been initially recruited  trained and sent to fight.Then  all of this boomeranged in the Chechen conflictagainst Russia  when those fighters turned their armsagainst their own patrons. As a result of two Chechenwars  Georgia has had to face an influx of thousands ofChechen refugees  and armed gangs of criminals forcedinto Georgia  followed by insistence from the Russianside on permitting a military operation against them onGeorgian soil. All this meant a spillover of the endlessand bloody war into Georgia  which we certainly couldnot allow. We are able to take  and are already taking all necessary measures to uproot any possibility of theuse of our territory by terrorists.Although it is evident that the problem of thePankisi Gorge of Georgia is a side effect of the war inChechnya  and not vice versa  the violations of airspaceand attacks against the sovereign territory of Georgiaby Russian military jets and helicopters have acquireda permanent character. The most recent air strike tookplace on 23 August 2002  causing civilian casualties.Georgia has irrefutable documentary and factualevidence of the attack  which has also been confirmedby the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope border monitoring operation.Despite the clear evidence  the Russian militaryleadership cynically denies these facts  trying to avoidan objective investigation in spite of their officialstatements that one will be carried out. Moreover unfolding hysteria in Russia on the issue of the PankisiGorge has culminated in statements by Russia'sPresident and its military openly threatening Georgiawith aggression. These actions not only gravelyendanger peace and security in the region  but alsoundermine the efforts of the global anti-terroristcoalition to fight against this menace.What is at stake here is not only the sovereigntyand independence of Georgia  but also the veryfundamentals of the current international system. Thatis why we have brought this issue to this high forum.As I mentioned  Georgian special forces  aided byour friends  are conducting an operation to restore lawand order in the Pankisi Gorge and the surroundingarea. We already have achieved positive results and areready to cooperate with all concerned parties  includingRussia. Moreover  we are open to all internationaltransparency measures.We call on the Russian side to reconsider theirapproach and  as President Shevardnadze stressed inhis letter  we appeal “to the leadership of Russia andthe President himself to find a common tongue [and] torise above the existing problems”. (ibid.) We stronglybelieve that there is no other way out.Speaking about the conflicts in the Caucasus  Iwould like to draw attention to the most painful issue:the conflict in Abkhazia  Georgia  where our jointefforts have not yet been successful. I believe that themajor mistake made by the international organizationswas to give the so-called Abkhaz authorities anopportunity to engage them in endless and absurddisputes because of which the bases of the peaceprocess were ignored.First  there is Georgia  a full-fledged member ofthe international community  whose internationallyrecognized territory is being violated by the non-legitimate  pseudo-Abkhaz regime based on hostilityand ethnic cleansing. No positive results can beachieved if the two sides are treated in the samemanner  if they are viewed as equally responsible and ifa policy of pleasing both of them is pursued.Secondly  there is the fate of the more than300 000 refugees and internally displaced persons whohave been ousted from their homeland and deprived oftheir basic human rights  and whose prospect of returnhas for the past eight years failed to go beyond fruitlessdiscussions. The years of ineffective negotiations meritonly those conclusions.I must excuse myself before the authors of themost recent Security Council resolution on this matter Council resolution 1427 (2002)  but I cannot agree withthe softness of their statements. Even though the defacto Abkhaz leadership completely ignored andcategorically refused to receive the document  “BasicPrinciples for the Distribution of Competences betweenTbilisi and Sukhumi”  elaborated by the Group ofFriends of the Secretary-General  the arrogance of theseparatist regime was responded to in the resolutiononly by a slight reproach.To our surprise  the most recent report of theSecretary-General  based on information from theUnited Nations Human Rights Office in Abkhazia Georgia  points to “a modest improvement in thehuman rights situation”. (S/2002/742  para. 23) It isdifficult to understand what kind of improvement ismeant when the separatists insist that Georgianchildren should study Georgian as a foreign language atGeorgian schools in Abkhazia  Georgia.The tragedy in Abkhazia  Georgia  wherehundreds of thousands  mostly ethnic Georgians  havebeen forcibly expelled from their homes  has numeroustimes been rightfully assessed by the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe as ethniccleansing. Thus  we can only be astonished that theUnited Nations is so reluctant to make the samestatement. This is the more so as the Abkhaz side hasnever complied with any of the 28 Security Councilresolutions adopted since 1993. I hope members wouldagree that such inconsistency only strengthens theseparatists' self-confidence and increases their belief intheir impunity.In 1994 we made an unprecedented decision byasking the United Nations to permit the commencementof a peacekeeping operation engaging the8Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  wherebythe “collective” peacekeeping forces included only aRussian military contingent. The reason for this wasthe complete absence of other alternatives at that time.Regrettably  eight years of this operation have madeclear that the Russian peacekeepers  acting under theCIS aegis  fail to ensure the security that is sonecessary for the return of the internally displacedpersons and refugees to their homes in Abkhazia Georgia. In fact  the peacekeepers have established anartificial border between the territory controlled by theseparatists and the rest of Georgia.On that basis  we think it is high time totransform substantively the ongoing peacekeepingoperation. In particular  we are in favour of introducinga civil police component and creating a joint Georgian-Abkhaz administration in the Gali district underinternational auspices. Considering the solid UnitedNations experience in the establishment andmanagement of international police forces  we havehigh expectations of the Assembly's support.We strongly believe that more active involvementof the international community  and primarily of theUnited Nations  is indispensable. We understand thatthe United Nations is currently involved in severalpeacekeeping operations. Irrespective of that fact  wehope that some resources can be found to ensure moreactive United Nations engagement in the resolution ofthe conflict in Abkhazia  Georgia.Speaking about the ineffectiveness ofinternational efforts in resolving the Abkhaz conflict we should admit that the lack of unanimity within theGroup of Friends of the Secretary-General remains aserious impeding factor. That is why it took almost twoyears just to win consensus on the so-called Bodendocument. Moreover  we are repeatedly faced withactions by one of the members of the Group that areutterly inconsistent with the general approach.At the end of 2000  the Russian Federationintroduced a visa regime with Georgia. But contrary tothe elementary norms of international law  the right tovisa-free movement has been maintained for thesecessionist regions of Georgia: the Abkhazia andTskhinvali regions. Numerous protests by the Georgianside against this discriminatory decision have beensimply ignored. Moreover  this was followed by themass issue of Russian passports to the local populationof these two separatist regions  and their massconversion to Russian citizenship through simplifiedprocedures. Here a question arises: how do theseactions  named “legal expansion” even by the Russianmedia  contribute to a peaceful resolution of theseconflicts?I have to reaffirm that a peaceful resolution of theconflict in Abkhazia  Georgia  remains the onlyacceptable option for my Government. But as I havealready mentioned  regrettably  the Abkhaz side hascategorically refused to consider the document thatdetermines the political status of Abkhazia within theState of Georgia. Therefore  we have to admit that theentire peace process in Abkhazia  Georgia  is as muchin jeopardy as it is in need of drastic changes. We callon the United Nations to address this problem.Finally  United Nations reform has long been atopic of discussion. It is unfortunate that work in thatregard has not progressed beyond an exchange of ideas.Too much time has been devoted to discussions onSecurity Council enlargement  the increase of thenumber of its permanent and non-permanent members the change of procedures related to the right of vetoand the adoption of joint decisions. Regrettably  therehave been no practical results so far.Here I would like to stress that Georgia reiteratesits full support for the speedy realization of theaforesaid changes. We strongly support grantingpermanent membership to Germany and Japan  as wellas the overall enlargement of the Security Council. Wealso insist on increased transparency in the work of theCouncil.The world community is currently facingnumerous challenges which require more decisive andradical steps. And I cherish the hope that this forumwill be courageous enough to make them without delay."
"64",2615,"GHA",57,2002,"﻿A year ago the entire worldwatched in horror as terror was visited on the city thatplays host to the United Nations. It is a city that haswelcomed people from all corners of the world forhundreds of years and that still remains for many anirresistible magnet as a place of opportunity.We watched  all of us  from our different partsof the world  as the terrible events unfolded. If therehad been any doubt before  that experience convincedall of us that our world had indeed become a globalvillage. Modern technology enabled all of ussimultaneously to watch the events as they unfolded.The devastation and drama of those events have sinceforcefully brought grief to our individual hearts  acrosscontinents  races  religions and political ideologies. Ifever there was any doubt about mankind's sharedhumanity  that catastrophe conclusively dispelled it.A year on  we still bear the deep scars; we havenot forgotten  and we dare not forget  because whathappened was not directed exclusively against NewYork and the people of the United States. Nationals ofmany countries  including Ghanaians  perished in thattragedy. What happened was indeed an affront tocivilization itself.Throughout the ages  whenever humanity hasfound itself confronted with great danger  it is the senseof unity and common purpose that has pulled usthrough. This is no exception. Indeed  the resilience ofNew York and of the people of the United States hasbrought about a spirit of solidarity and generosity thatis just as awesome to behold as the tragic event itself.It is for that reason that I am optimistic about thefuture. The work of the United Nations and of non-governmental organizations  and the growingacceptance of the principles of good governance human rights  tolerance for a diversity of views and therule of law around the globe make me optimistic. In mymind's eye  I can already see  in the near future  aworld in which there is more openness  moreforbearance and less categorization of mankind.Our nations have been brought together byscience  technology and conscience  as well as by4adversity  and the acknowledgement ofinterdependence among peoples has become a reality.Now we are moving from the concept of beggar thyneighbour' to one of prosper thy neighbour'  whichshould become the hallmark of the global village.Sadly  the continent of Africa still lags behind inmany spheres  as poverty and disease plague thecontinent. But there is a new spirit abroad among theAfrican countries. Africa has never wanted to beperceived as the scar on the conscience of the world'.We do not want to be the object of pity and charity  andwe do not want to provide the grisly images of war disease  ignorance  famine and poverty for the world'stelevision screens. It was largely as a result of ourdetermination to shed that unacceptable image thatmany a country on the continent  on attainingindependence  desperately rushed into one or anotheruntried ideology or economic model that tended only toworsen the woes of self-doubt left by exploitative andunconscionable colonialism.Today  under the auspices of the African Union the rejuvenated continental grouping  our countrieshave resolved to tackle the continent's problems toenable us join the mainstream of world development.We have pledged to endeavour to be honest with eachother  and under the Peer Review Mechanism there willbe no hiding behind claims of sovereignty in order totolerate abuses of human rights in individual countries.We are determined to strive for democracy andgood governance  not because those are fashionablebuzzwords but because we are convinced that they arethe surest  if not always the most rapid  path to thedevelopment that we require to uplift the conditions oflife of our peoples.The technology exists and the human expertiseabounds in the world to end the degrading poverty anddebilitating diseases that sap the confidence of thepeoples of Africa. This world Assembly must rally tohelp Africa in its genuine efforts to tap into theintellectual  financial and moral resources of the globe to be a worthy partner within it. The concept of theNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD)provides the framework within which African countriescan be assisted to become part of the mainstream. Itprovides a great opportunity for world leaders to movefrom rhetoric to purposeful action.Education has served as a route out of poverty forpeople throughout the ages  and it should be the wayout for us in Africa as well. We have an essentiallyyoung population that is ready and anxious to learn.Fortunately  information and communicationstechnology provides the means to help Africa leap-froginto the modern world. Let the world communitytherefore assist Africa to join in the mastery of thispowerful tool.Ours is a well-endowed continent. Our rawmaterials keep the manufacturing engines of the worldrunning. The reasons for investing in Africa  therefore need not be charitable; investment can be based onsound economic considerations. The market potentialof a thriving and economically viable Africa will dowonders not only for Africa but also for the worldeconomy at large.I am optimistic  because I think of what Ghanaand the African continent have contributed to thedevelopment of the world. We have provided  andcontinue to provide  personnel in various fields to allkinds of institutions in the world. Ghanaian academicsand citizens from many other African countries can befound in many top universities and companies aroundthe world  contributing significantly to thedevelopment of cutting-edge enterprises. Africans arein various jobs and are making a considerablecontribution to the running of organizations  includingthe United Nations. I would like to take thisopportunity to express Ghana's  and Africa's deepest gratitude to the international community forthe confidence it showed in re-electing Mr. KofiAnnan  the Secretary-General  to a second term.In all these endeavours  however  the missing linkfor Africa has been the solid and sustainableframework for good governance to support thepurposeful evolution of prosperous and stable nationson the continent. It is for this reason that Ghana  likeother African nations  is trying to put its house in orderto take advantage of emerging prospects. We arenurturing our infant democracy  and the citizens arepassionately committed to the defence of theConstitution. We are putting in place mechanisms tosupport good governance. The institutional frameworkis being created to ensure an efficient public sector thatcan interface effectively with an enterprising privatesector to create wealth and eliminate poverty.But Ghana  like other developing countries cannot alone achieve the dramatic rate of growth that isrequired; there must be significant injections of outside5investment into our economy. We need affordable andsustainable sources of energy to be able to achieverapid development. We need the partnership  marketsand support of the international community to sustainour development. That is the message of NEPAD. Weare working to develop a positive economicenvironment to receive and integrate foreign directinvestment as a tool for regional development. That isthe sure path for Africa to connect effectively with theglobal markets.Ghana acknowledges its share of responsibility toprotect the resources that Nature has given our countryas the heritage of all humankind. The world cannot andmust not operate on the basis of the survival of thefittest. Weaknesses caused by history and other factorsmust be taken into account and  above all  our commonhumanity must inform all our international dealings.Ghana sees a lot of potential in globalization. Wewish to recommend  however  that an organization suchas the United Nations should provide the regulatoryframework to ensure that the benefits of globalizationare more equitably distributed. The opportunities areenormous for those who can take advantage of themove to more liberalized markets and increased flowsof investment capital. But nature did not make allpeople equally competitive. That global organizationmust  therefore  evolve systems of safety nets toguarantee all humanity an acceptable minimum degreeof dignity and respectability. The United Nations mustrise up to this challenge.For the pure and proper development of theglobal village  certain initiatives by this Organizationmust be commended and encouraged. Ghana is in fullsupport of United Nations effort to curb the illicit tradein small arms and light weapons. We urge MemberStates to join in the early implementation of theProgramme of Action that was adopted in 2001 to stopthis trade  from which most of the instability in Africastems.Secondly  women and children need ourprotection. It is for that very reason that in Ghana wehave created a Ministry for Women and ChildrenësAffairs to enable us tackle issues that affect those twogroups. We have embarked on a vibrant educationalcampaign and are pursuing policy initiatives that willcreate awareness and reduce the incidence ofdiscrimination against women and help improve theirlivelihoods. We are also striving to ban child labourand enforce free and compulsory education for allchildren up to the junior secondary school level asenjoined by Ghanaës national Constitution.Thirdly  I must mention the HIV/AIDS pandemic which is threatening the survival of our countries. Thespread of the disease is compounding our difficultieseven further. I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his interest  and for the setting up of theGlobal Fund to help us fight the menace. The GhanaAIDS Commission is constantly seeking new ways tochange attitudes at all levels towards the disease  andwe seek to learn from the experience of others incombating it. We support the efforts of the internationalcommunity to provide more affordable antiretroviraldrugs for the most needy.At this stage  permit me to congratulateSwitzerland on its accession to membership  and EastTimor on its forthcoming accession. That Switzerlandhas at long last joined the Organization confirms itsuniversality. They are welcome.The tragedy of 11 September has certainly made adifference to the world. It has shocked the world intouniting to condemn it. Let those of us who haveaccepted the honour and privilege to speak on behalf ofour peoples determine that we must strive for a worldof greater tolerance and of more justice  a morehumane world in which law and order are fullyrespected both within nations and in the internationalcommunity. Eleven September must be used tounderpin the vital communal spirit that must motivatethe global village. We would then be able to say thatwe had left the world a better place than we found it."
"65",2661,"GIN",57,2002,"﻿Allow me at the outset  to express my warm congratulations andwishes to His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan for everysuccess on his election to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I should alsolike to express my delegation's gratitude to HisExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo for the competent andable manner in which he conducted the work of thefifty-sixth session. I wish to convey to His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  the sincereappreciation of His Excellency General Lansana Conté President of the Republic of Guinea  for his tireless anddedicated efforts on behalf of the community ofnations.In addition  I wish to welcome the admission ofthe Swiss Confederation  a country of great traditionsof peace and democracy  to the Organization. Mydelegation looks forward with great interest to theforthcoming entry of the Democratic Republic ofTimor-Leste to the family of nations. I remainconvinced that the accession of those two countrieswill make a high-quality contribution to the endeavoursof the international community and will strengthen theOrganization's universality.Twelve months have passed since the tragicevents of 11 September 2001. The global securityclimate has suffered profound changes  casting newlight on the dangers of international terrorism and itsinterdependence with other forms of crime. Terrorism one need hardly stress again  constitutes a menace tointernational peace and security. Faced with the globaldimensions of that scourge  my country associatesitself fully with the efforts of the internationalcommunity with a view to providing an appropriateresponse.In that regard  we hope for the prompt adoptionof a general convention against terrorism and for theeffective implementation of other existing internationallegal instruments. Within the framework of thedialogue among civilizations  an appeal should beaddressed to all countries for the organization of anextensive campaign of education and consciousness-raising in order to promote tolerance  respect andacceptance of others.The current session is being held in a difficultinternational context dominated by numerous conflictsthat compromise legitimate aspirations to peace andprogress. In this climate of violence  nevertheless  agleam of hope can be glimpsed on the Africancontinent. We welcome the important progress madetowards the restoration of peace in Angola and in theGreat Lakes region  especially in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and in Burundi. In the Horn ofAfrica  peace between Eritrea and Ethiopia is graduallyreturning  but the Somalia crisis remains more17worrisome than ever. In Western Sahara  my countrysupports the remarkable work accomplished by thePersonal Envoy of the Secretary-General  Mr. JamesBaker. We encourage him to persist in his efforts with aview to finding an acceptable and definitive solution tothat crisis.In the Middle East  the conflict situation persists.The cycle of acute violence over the past two years haswidened further the gap between the parties reinforcing the wall of misunderstanding. TheGovernment of Guinea is convinced that theapplication of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)and 338 (1973) will allow Palestinians and Israelis tocoexist peacefully within secure and internationallyrecognized borders. We appeal to the two parties tocomply unconditionally with Council resolutions 1397(2002) and 1402 (2002). We reaffirm the support andthe solidarity of Guinea to the brotherly people ofPalestine  to the Palestinian Authority and to its head President Yasser Arafat  who has fought courageouslyfor the creation of an independent and sovereignPalestinian State for more than 50 years.The situation in Iraq is a source of vital concernto the people and the Government of Guinea. In orderto prevent further suffering by the Iraqi population andto preserve peace in the region as well as internationalsecurity and stability  my country invites the parties toshow greater restraint. Iraq's acceptance of theunconditional return of the United Nations Monitoring Verification and Inspection Commission is anencouraging sign for the peaceful settlement of thecrisis. My delegation appeals earnestly to Iraq torespect and comply with the relevant Councilresolutions.Turning to the Korean Peninsula  Guinea supportsthe efforts for peaceful reunification of the two Koreas in conformity with the declaration signed by the headsof State of the two countries in June 2001.My Government reaffirms its attachment to theprinciple of one China.I now turn to the situation in our subregion  WestAfrica  an area that has long been shaken by internalcrises but that is now moving towards a climate ofpeace and stability. Sierra Leone has committed itselfto the path of peace and reconciliation  thanks to themediation of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) and to the support of theUnited Nations. That success was also made possibleby the United Kingdom's important role. In Liberia  thesituation is still precarious. My delegation remainsconvinced that the adoption and effectiveimplementation of a programme of disarmament demobilization and reintegration of armed groups based on the successful conclusion of the inter-Liberian dialogue begun in Abuja  will contribute tothe restoration of peace and stability in the subregion.Guinea  a member of the Mano River Union  renews itscommitment to continuing to work for peace.Because of that commitment  my country took anactive part  in the Rabat Summit  on 27 February 2002and in the process of implementing itsrecommendations. The political dialogue at the Summitshould be pursued with a view to strengtheningconfidence between the parties. In that regard  it isimportant to point out that the Joint SecurityCommittee of the Mano River Union  which met inFreetown on 10 September 2002  decided tosimultaneously reopen the borders among the threecountries of the Union and to organize a caravan forpeace next October that will tour those countries. Mydelegation takes this opportunity to again express itsprofound gratitude to His Majesty King Mohammed VIof Morocco for his mediation. The political dialogue atthe Summit and the respect for measures imposed bySecurity Council resolution 1343 (2001) represent twocomplementary tracks of managing the situation in theMano River Basin. The international community  inparticular the Council  should ensure follow-up  whilebearing in mind the interdependence of the situations inLiberia and Sierra Leone. The Government of Guineahopes that the establishment of the Office of theSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General forWest Africa will contribute to meeting the challengesfaced by the States of the subregion. We also welcomethe creation of a Security Council Working Group onConflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa. Clearly that initiative is likely to contribute to our commonreflection on such problems.Disarmament issues  particularly those related tolight weapons and to anti-personnel mines  remain asource of concern. As members are aware  Guineabelongs to a subregion whose population continues tosuffer the adverse effects of the proliferation and theillicit circulation of light weapons  which feedconflicts  lead to the resurgence of crime andencourage the phenomenon of child soldiers.18We welcome the renewal of the ECOWASMoratorium aimed at eradicating that phenomenon. Wecall for the implementation of all measures for thedismantling of supply networks of small arms and lightweapons. We support the pursuit of all the activitiesunder way to alleviate the suffering and loss of lifecaused by anti-personnel mines.The consequences of armed conflicts and naturaldisasters primarily affect vulnerable civilianpopulations  which constitute the majority of refugeesand displaced persons. For more than a decade  Guineahas been hard hit by the negative socio-economic security and environmental impact of wars in Liberia Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau.Let me take this opportunity to reiterate ourappeal for the holding of a special consultation of theUnited Nations on Guinea. In this context  my countryappreciates the renewed commitment made by theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) atthe workshop held on 18 July 2002 by the SecurityCouncil on the countries of the Mano River Union.My delegation welcomes the creation of theRegional Bureau for humanitarian affairs in WestAfrica  the extension of the rapid response system fornatural disasters and the setting up of the integratedregional information network.Prevention and resolution of conflicts calls for thereduction of poverty and eradication of disease. Thequestion of HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosisremains a source of concern  especially for developingcountries  particularly those in Africa. The adoption bythe General Assembly of the Millennium Declaration the declaration of commitment on HIV/AIDS and the2001-2010 Decade to Roll Back Malaria in DevelopingCountries  Particularly in Africa  are significant stepsforward.But the question of mobilizing resources remainscentral to this effort. The primary responsibility formeasures to be taken to implement these initiativesfalls to African leaders. However  they need to besupported at the community  national  regional andinternational levels.My delegation welcomes the Secretary-General'sinitiative that led to the creation of the Global Fund toFight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria and othertransmittable diseases. One of the commitments madeby heads of State and Government at the historicMillennium Summit was to reduce  if not eliminate poverty. But much of the planet's population is stillliving in absolute poverty. This situation is aggravatedby the effects of globalization that  in the absence ofjust and equitable rules  increases the capacity of thestrong to promote their interests  while limiting that ofthe weak.The advent of the African Union illustrates thewill of African peoples to achieve the objectives ofeconomic integration and consolidate the foundationsof peace  stability and security in Africa. In thatframework the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD) remains an effectiveinstrument for enhancing the African economies andbringing about their integration into the worldeconomy. My delegation appeals to the various partnersto provide effective support in order to make thatcommon vision a reality.We hope that the decisions of the InternationalConference on Financing for Development inMonterrey  the commitments of the G-8 in Kananaskisand the Plan of Implementation of the World Summiton Sustainable Development held at Johannesburg willhave a positive impact on Africa.My delegation welcomes the improvement of theprocedures and methods of work aimed at betteroperation of the General Assembly. We support thereform of the Security Council  to adapt it to therequirements of democracy and transparency especially by increasing the number of its permanentand non-permanent members on the basis of a moreequitable geographical distribution.Two years after the historic MillenniumDeclaration  the gap between North and Southcontinues to widen. I wish to express our sincere hopefor the advent of a world of greater justice andsolidarity in the framework of true partnership forpeace and development. Accordingly  we remainconvinced that the United Nations  reformed revitalized  adapted to new changes  remains a viableframework to face the challenges before us  and thus toensure for future generations the conditions necessaryfor their fulfilment."
"66",2700,"GMB",57,2002,"﻿Let me first congratulateMr. Kavan on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session and for theexcellent manner in which he has been presiding overour deliberations since the beginning of the session.With the calibre of leadership he has displayed  addedto his vast experience and wisdom  I have no doubt thatour deliberations will be easily guided to a successfuloutcome.Let me also express my delegation's thanks andappreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  forhis efficiency and effectiveness in conducting thebusiness of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly.I would be remiss if I did not pay homage to ourSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for another year offine stewardship of our Organization and of humanityat large. Thanks to his leadership  our Organization hasbeen able to cross a number of important frontiers inthe year since we last met.Lastly  my delegation warmly congratulates EastTimor on its full transition to democracy  its successfulconduct of democratic elections  its recent accession toindependence and its subsequent admission into ourUnited Nations family. Our congratulations also go tothe Government and people of Switzerland on accedingto full membership of the United Nations as the 190thand newest Member State.Our session is being convened at a time when theanniversary of the dastardly 11 September attack on theUnited States is being observed. We join the rest of theworld  including the families of the victims  inremembering those who lost their lives and we praythat almighty God grant them eternal rest. Gambianswere among the thousands from many nations of theworld who were victims of the attack. This only goes toshow that terrorism knows no national boundaries. Incommemorating 11 September  President Jammehdeclared a public holiday for people to stay home andpray. We must therefore harness all our efforts andcooperate effectively to address this wickedphenomenon and its root causes.Let me take this opportunity to commend theCounter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant toSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) for the goodwork that it is doing in enhancing cooperation in thefield of counter-terrorism. In the course of this year the Gambia was able to accede to all the major treatiesrelating to terrorism and we are currently in the processof implementing resolution 1373 (2001).The year 2002 has been a busy one for us all.First  we came here for the special session on children.Then  we went off to Monterrey for the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  and we justrecently concluded our deliberations on sustainabledevelopment in Johannesburg  South Africa. At each ofthese important forums  we were offered theopportunity of rededicating ourselves to the nobleobjectives of our Organization  especially those thatwere so strongly evinced at the Millennium Summitand enshrined in the millennium development goals which we all espoused.Through our deliberations at these meetings inthe course of this year  we have recommitted ourselvesto striving in a more purposeful and determined mannerto spread and deepen democracy throughout the world;do better in protecting human rights  fundamentalhuman freedoms and the rule of law; strengthen our17cooperation in the fight against hunger  poverty anddisease; do more to protect the weak and vulnerable inour respective societies  particularly children  the agedand the handicapped; and redouble our efforts tosanitize and preserve the physical and human ecologyand environment. These are some of the importantpillars on which world peace and security are built andwhich we must consciously work to strengthen andpreserve from crumbling. That is the only sure way thatglobal security and development  which are at the coreof our Organization's mandate  can be assured.We in the Gambia have been doing all we can tostay the course in the uphill task of nation-buildingunder the inspired and dynamic leadership of PresidentAl Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh. In the area of goodgovernance  I am pleased to inform this body that  withspecial reference to the democratization process following the much-acclaimed presidential electionsheld last October  National Assembly elections wereheld on 17 January and local Government elections on25 April 2002. Mindful of the need to cultivate theculture of democracy and good governance  theGovernment of the Gambia has since developed andadopted a national governance policy and programme.The main components of the policy frameworkare constitutional review and reform of electoralprocesses; enhancing parliamentary structures andprocesses; civic education; reform of legal and judicialprocesses and constitutional review; public sectormanagement and administrative reform; anddecentralization and reform of local Governmentsystems. Clearly  governance constitutes an importantcomponent of our poverty reduction strategy.Halfway through the United Nations Decade forthe Eradication of Poverty  and in spite of all thecommitments we have made over the years to reducepoverty and to accelerate the pace of social andeconomic development throughout the world  the gapbetween the rich and the poor is widening and theabsolute number of poor people  especially in thedeveloping world  is increasing. The scourge ofpoverty is insidious. It contains within itself all theelements that militate against its victim's ability to riseabove his or her condition.Therefore  fighting poverty calls for conscious deliberate interventions that only the strong canprovide to help the weak. These interventions come for the most part  in the form of resource flows.Unfortunately  these have been dwindling over theyears and  in spite of the recent commitments made bythe G8 countries in Kananaskis in support of the newAfrican initiative — the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  for which we are grateful —overall  the shortfalls in the fight against poverty arestill huge and growing.The international community should not leadAfrican countries to disenchantment. The HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is  for the mostpart  still good only on paper  largely speaking.Protectionist policies and heavy subsidies continue tofrustrate our efforts to earn a decent living throughproduction and trade. And the promises of increasedofficial development assistance and other forms ofassistance over four United Nations DevelopmentDecades have remained largely unfulfilled. In fact  thissession of the General Assembly will look into theimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda forthe Development of Africa in the 1990s  and the mainconclusion will be that  by and large  the commitmentsmade by Africa's development partners have not beenmet. We missed another opportunity for the multilateralsystem to work towards poverty eradication and socialand economic development.With special reference to the plight of leastdeveloped countries  I would like to add the Gambia'svoice to those of previous speakers in calling for arenewed commitment to implementing the programmeof action for the least developed countries for thedecade 2001-2010. In that connection  we commendthe General Assembly for the decision taken toestablish the Office of the High Representative for theLeast Developed Countries  Landlocked DevelopingCountries and Small Island Developing States. We lookforward to working closely with the HighRepresentative.The recently held ministerial meeting of leastdeveloped countries in Cotonou was indeed timely  andwe call on the rest of the international community tolend its full support to the least developed countries sothat we implement fully the decisions taken. Wecannot  however  discuss the issue of povertyalleviation without mentioning the problem of womenand children. With regard to our women folk  we needto focus more on the 12 critical areas of concern laidout in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 18including gender inequalities. As for the issuesconcerning children  we hope that the follow-upsummit held here in New York recently will strengthenus in our resolve to achieve the noble goals that wehave set for ourselves to give our children a brighterfuture.For our part  in the Gambia we have evolved astrong and focused policy on poverty  which we havearticulated in a programme of action for povertyalleviation. The strategy is anchored on myGovernment's commitment to eradicate poverty in thelong term  by increasing income through economicgrowth and empowering the population with thecapacity for sustainable development. Our fight againstpoverty stands on five pillars: the creation of anenabling environment for economic growth anddevelopment  enhancing the productive capacity andsocial protection of the poor  improving coverage ofbasic services  political empowerment of civil society and strengthened partnerships with developmentstakeholders. My Government is committed torelentlessly pursuing those objectives in line with theobjectives of the Millennium Development Goals. Inthat  we shall be counting on the wholehearted supportof the international community.At this juncture  I would like to express myGovernment's most profound gratitude to our principalpartners in development and to the donor community atlarge for their active participation at the sixthRoundtable Donors Conference for the Gambia  held inGeneva on 18 and 19 September 2002. We areconfident that all the pledges made will be honoured sothat together  in the true spirit of internationalsolidarity  we will implement smoothly andsuccessfully our national programme of action forpoverty alleviation.That is all the more urgent considering the factthat  during the rainy season this year  we experienceda long dry spell initially  resulting in the poorperformance of both crops and livestock.It is our hope that all nations of the world willredouble their efforts to live up to the commitmentsthey made in Rio and  just recently  reaffirmed inJohannesburg. Even as we search for ways of takingour people out of poverty  we should also be mindful ofthe need to conserve our natural environment.Of particular concern to my delegation are thedestructive fishing practices in the South Atlantic.Despite the adoption of numerous internationalinstruments to regulate fishing with a view toconserving fish stocks  unsustainable and often illegalfishing continues unabated in our coastal waters. Theunbridled pursuit of profit without due regard tosustainability and long-term food security is the onlyreason for that undesirable situation. My delegationtherefore calls on all Member States to cooperate withus to address this serious state of affairs and to provideus with technical and other forms of assistance toenable all affected countries to better police theirwaters in order to arrest those unsustainable andharmful fishing practices.The momentum generated in Johannesburg mustnot be allowed to wither away. It must be recognized however  that there can be no meaningful developmentwithout peace and stability. That is why we attach greatimportance to the issue of peacekeeping.In the field of peacekeeping  our Organizationcontinues to score remarkable successes. We appreciatethe efforts of the Security Council to put in place arapid response mechanism through which amultinational force could quickly be deployed to anypart of the world. However  there is need to ensure thatadequate resources are made available so that nopeacekeeping operation is disrupted on account of lackof funds  thereby plunging the countries concernedback into a vortex of violence. Funding availability isalso important to bridge the gap between peacekeepingand national reconstruction.The determination with which we have dealt withthreats to peace has paid handsome dividends in theperiod since we last met. That is why we welcome thegreat efforts made to distinguish the existing conflictsin Africa  especially in Sierra Leone  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and Angola.With regard to the Sudan  my Governmentapplauds the signing of the Machacos Protocol betweenthe Government and the Sudanese People's LiberationArmy (SPLA). We hope and pray that the process nowstarted will finally bring that protracted conflict to anend.While we may rightly commend ourselves onthose achievements  we must not rest on our oars.There are still some significant areas of uncertainty andvolatility in our own West African subregion that weneed to address. That requires a relentless effort.19In our capacity as coordinator of the Group offriends of Guinea-Bissau  here at the United Nations we are calling on the rest of the internationalcommunity to provide more assistance to that sistercountry. In that way  the democratization process willbe consolidated and the country's economicperformance enhanced.We must bear in mind that ending hostilities isone thing and getting the system on the right path tosocial and economic development of the type thatwould eliminate the causes of conflict is quite another.In like manner  a successful transition into ademocratic dispensation does not necessarily  in and ofitself  usher in peace and security. In many of thecountries where conflicts have ended  political stabilityremains fragile  and uncertainty and instability prevail.In those countries  there is need to go beyond theimmediate political requirements for consolidatingpeace  to address governance in its broadest sense including its economic and financial aspects  as well asthe capacities required for strengthening it. That is theemerging challenge for the international community.We must devise mechanisms for follow-through intopeace-building and be ready to provide the resources toprogressively restore confidence and strength amongthose at the frontline.President Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh  the Governmentand people of the Gambia are fully committed to thesearch for peace and the resolution of conflictseverywhere  particularly in our immediate subregion.That is why we not only open our doors to ourneighbours in distress  hosting many refugees  but wealso work actively with them as well as with othermembers of the international community  including theSecretary-General and his able team to removemisunderstandings that could easily lead to a flare upof conflict.The situation in the Middle East remains a matterof grave concern to my delegation. The SecurityCouncil must show more leadership in the efforts of theinternational community to contain and resolve theserious tensions between Israel and Palestine  whichpose a grave threat to the stability of the nations in theregion and the peace of the whole world. It isunacceptable for the world to stand back and watch ashelpless civilians are attacked in refugee camps or arekilled or maimed by suicide bombers. The suffering ofinnocent people in the Middle East must be brought toan end immediately.My delegation strongly urges  therefore  that allthe relevant United Nations resolutions on Palestineand the Middle East  notably Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  be compliedwith without further delay. We also fully support thosewho have called for the recognition of the State ofIsrael by all nations  as well as the creation and therecognition by all of a State of Palestine.Elsewhere in the Middle East  there are still someunresolved issues. The situation between Iraq andKuwait has still not been fully resolved  and we arestill seeking a satisfactory resolution of the question ofthe Kuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons  aswell as the return of the Kuwaiti national archives.Within Iraq itself  we in the Gambia have alwayscalled for the alleviation of the suffering of theinnocent Iraqi people. With regard to the otherunfinished business of weapons inspections  mydelegation applauds the decision of the Government ofIraq to invite the United Nations weapons inspectors toreturn to Iraq to resume their work. We have alwaysupheld the view that parties to any dispute shouldallow the United Nations to assume its responsibilityunhindered in our common quest for amicable closureto conflict situations. We therefore note withsatisfaction the important statement made by PresidentBush recognizing the central role of the United Nationsand calling on the latter to assume its responsibility.But let us also remember that we  all of us — nationsbig and small  rich and poor — constitute the UnitedNations. It can be only what we the Member Stateswant it to be. The choice is ours.In South Asia  we cannot be indifferent to theprevailing situation between India and Pakistan. Thoseare two great countries with which the Gambia hasalways enjoyed excellent relations. We are thereforecalling on them  out of that friendship  to exerciserestraint at all times and to withdraw their troops fromtheir respective borders.After years of hard work and tough negotiations we finally succeeded in establishing the InternationalCriminal Court (ICC)  with the entry into force of theRome Statute. We salute the tireless efforts of all thosewho contributed in one way or another to that hugesuccess. It is our fervent hope that the Court  with theactive collaboration of all like-minded States  will actas an effective instrument in the fight against20international crimes of all sorts and  by extension extinguish the culture of impunity.Turning now to the issue of sanctions  mydelegation firmly believes that the time has now comefor us to review the procedure being used to imposesanctions on countries and individuals. The permanentmembers of the Security Council  who determine whoshould be placed on a sanctions or travel ban list  donot usually provide evidence  either to the individualconcerned or to his Government  to justify theirdecision. We have come to see that in many cases  suchdecisions are based on speculation and conjecture andthat the individuals in question really did not deserve tobe punished and humiliated. Thus far  mostGovernments have been very cooperative and  whilerepeatedly requesting to no avail that evidence ofwrong-doing be made known to them  have nonethelessgone along with the rest of the international communityin respecting the decision taken by the Council. Someof those Governments  mine included  are reaching thepoint of exasperation and have resolved that  unless theevidence being requested of the Security Council isprovided  they will refuse to comply with any ban orsanctions imposed on their nationals. We sometimeswonder whether someone out there does not have ahidden agenda. As sovereign nations  we demand moretransparency before acquiescing to our nationals beingpunished for wrongdoings that we have not been shownthey have committed. The United Nations SecurityCouncil must not be a bully.In like manner  the multifaceted sanctionsimposed on Cuba are still in place despite numerousresolutions calling for their removal. A window ofopportunity now exists for them to be finally set aside.It is in nobody's interest to continue to pursue policiesagainst Cuba that have lost their appeal.Sabres are rattling on one side of the TaiwanStrait in the face of 23 million souls  for their merelyhaving claimed their God-given right to be recognizedas a political  economic and social entity. The Republicof China on Taiwan is today the only country on earththat is not represented in the United Nations  contraryto the main guiding principle of the United Nations: theprinciple of universality. Article four of the Charterinvites “all ... peace-loving States” to become Membersof the Organization. The people of Taiwan havedemonstrated over the years not only that they arepeace-loving but also that they can contribute to all theobjectives of the United Nations in the fields of globalsecurity  financial stability  culture  industrial andtechnological growth and sustainable development.Taiwan is not an insignificant player in the worldproduction and trade arena. It is the world's sixteenthlargest economy. It is equally highly developed in thefield of scientific and medical research.In recognition of its importance as a tradingnation  it was recently admitted into the World TradeOrganization. Logic demands that  for the very samereason  it should also be admitted into the WorldHealth Organization in recognition of its importance asa country of highly sophisticated and developed healthservices; into the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization because of itsexceptionally high standing in the fields of science andculture; into the United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization because of its mostadvanced industrial and technological development;into the United Nations Children's Fund because of itshighly developed child development policies andprogrammes; into the Food and AgricultureOrganization  the International Fund for AgriculturalDevelopment and the World Food Programme becauseof its extremely well developed agriculture and itsimportance as a food producer; and into the UnitedNations Development Programme because of its hugeofficial development assistance to developing countriesfor capacity-building and poverty alleviation. In short it should be admitted into all branches of the UnitedNations family because of the tremendouscontributions it could make to the ideals andprogrammes of the United Nations.Taiwan is a vibrant democracy with high ratingson human rights  press freedom and the observance ofthe rights of the individual. It could contributeimmensely to global security and the fight againstterrorism. It is therefore baffling that this highlydeveloped  friendly and peace-loving nation has beenbarred from membership in the United Nations forpurely political reasons. My Government will not restuntil this injustice is undone and the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan is granted its rightful place among thecomity of nations.Still in the same region  with regard to the KoreanPeninsula  my delegation would like to reiterate onceagain our unflinching support for all the efforts gearedtowards peaceful unification.21Finally  my delegation believes that the GeneralAssembly needs to be strengthened so that it could playan even greater role in our quest for a just andequitable world order. We welcome the moves beingmade to reform this important organ of the UnitedNations in ways that would render it more effective indischarging its mandate.This is particularly true of the Security Council.We in the Gambia will continue to add our voice to theclamour for the Security Council to be reformed inorder to make it more democratic and more in tunewith the realities of and requirements for globalsecurity in the twenty-first century. The credibility andrelevance of the Security Council now depend on thereforms that we all have been calling for. Thedeveloping countries must be allowed a much moreeffective participation in this powerful organ of theUnited Nations. Africa should have a minimum of twopermanent seats.In conclusion  we urge all nations  great andsmall  to work relentlessly towards preserving theideals for which the Organization was set up. Weshould all eschew behaviours that undermine theobjectives of the United Nations and that frustrate itsefforts. Multilateralism is the only hope left to mankindfor the peaceful resolution of conflicts and themaintenance of international peace and security. Let uscherish and nurture it. Multilateralism will thrive onlyif there is trust and confidence among all the actors.But a system that repeatedly frustrates and lets downone portion of its membership will malfunction andeventually become ineffective and irrelevant. We musttherefore all do more to ensure that such a fate does notbefall our Organization."
"67",2740,"GNB",57,2002,"﻿First of all  I would like to thank theoutgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. HanSeung-soo  for the superb manner in which he led thework of the fifty-sixth session of the Assembly.Permit me  Sir  to congratulate you on yourelection to the presidency of the fifty-seventh sessionof the General Assembly  and to express my bestwishes for success in your work at the head of thisimportant body. It is with enormous satisfaction that on behalf of the President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  Mr. Kumba Yalá  we welcome Switzerland as aMember of the United Nations. We also look forwardto welcoming the Republic of Timor-Leste  a memberof our community of Portuguese-speaking countries.The loss of human lives can never be justified bya cause  no matter what its noble goals. Just a year ago the people of Guinea-Bissau joined their voices tothose of the international community in condemning allacts of terrorism and all actions which would threateninternational security.We are convinced of the lofty ideals ofdemocracy  in which human security becomes the pillarof society's development. Therefore  on my ownaccount and on behalf of the people of Guinea-Bissau I condemn the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and we reiterate our conviction that the only way inwhich to combat such infamy is to unite all our effortsunder the auspices of the United Nations.Our readiness to cooperate in the quest forsolutions that will guarantee peace and stability in oursubregion is great  although the internal conflicts inneighbouring countries inevitably entail costs in thedefence and security areas. They also compel us tosacrifice the meagre budgets of priority sectors of theGovernment's programme  such as health andeducation.The progressive establishment of democracy human rights  international cooperation anddevelopment will restore the dignity of our people.Convinced of this  we are developing partnerships withthe United Nations system to combat poverty inGuinea-Bissau. We continue to make sacrifices to pavethe way for development. These sacrifices includeinterruptions in the normal course of development in aState where the 1998 conflict bore witness to the evilsof a people's poverty  and to the destruction of the16precarious structures of a new State in a region wherethere are pockets of conflict that tend to cross borders and thus to increase the climate of instability.The Senegalese conflict  in the Casamanceregion  provides an example of our resolve to help findconsensus solutions to put an end to many years ofarmed conflict in the neighbouring Republic ofSenegal. Respect for the Charter of the Organization ofAfrican Unity as it relates to the retention of theborders inherited from colonialism calls for Guinea-Bissau's participation in efforts to establish peace andstability in a united and indivisible Senegal.Based on this conviction  our country supportsthe efforts of the People's Republic of China towardspeaceful reunification  under the theme of “one nation two systems.”The economic and financial difficulties faced bythe Government of Guinea-Bissau have been the objectof attention by the members of the Security Council. Itis clear that peacekeeping efforts cannot be divorcedfrom the need to preserve economic and social stabilityin Guinea-Bissau. Thus  progress on peacekeeping  oneconomic recovery and on development in Guinea-Bissau are interdependent.Guinea-Bissau  a member of the African Union is involved in the struggle for peace  stability democracy  the defence of human rights  cooperation development  prosperity and human dignity. We arebound  furthermore  by our national poverty reductionstrategy to contribute to the socio-economicprogramme to revitalize our continent  following thebroader approach of the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD).It is clear to Guinea-Bissau that the UnitedNations  as a forum for dealing with questions relatedto world peace  respect for human rights  theeradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainabledevelopment worldwide  is encouraging andcontributing in practical ways to the success of NEPADand to ensuring that the commitments entered into inDoha  Monterrey and Johannesburg will be effectivelyimplemented.Guinea-Bissau remains committed to findingsolutions to its difficult socio-economic situation  andappeals to the international community to contribute tothe implementation of our national poverty reductionstrategy.I would like to recognize the intelligent  patrioticmanner in which Angola put an end to long years ofconflict  as well as the progress made towards theresolution of the conflicts in Senegal  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Burundi and the Comoros.Dialogue is the best instrument for restoringpeace and working towards stability and developmentfor humanity. That is why we encourage the actors inthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict to join in the effort tofind acceptable solutions to bring about concretesecurity and prosperity for both peoples. Strictcompliance with Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and 1397 (2002) will be the onlyresponse acceptable to the Assembly and the only proofthat the parties recognize the incalculable value of ourOrganization.To realize the promises contained in theMillennium Declaration and in the United NationsCharter  which would guarantee a more prosperous andjust world  we join in the appeal made to the leaders ofIraq to abide by Security Council resolutions withrespect to Chapter VII of the Charter  in order to avoida possible Council decision.Guinea-Bissau shares the need for broader andmore effective participation in the work of the SecurityCouncil  which is a vital organ of the Organization.Permit me to recall that reducing poverty in thepoorest countries  such as ours  will guarantee theprosperity  stability  peace and security of the entireworld and is the best way to neutralize terrorism.We speak out in the struggle against theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and forthe creation of conditions which will allow access tobasic resources such as water  to education and to theprotein necessary for healthy growth.Solidarity among peoples is and will continue tobe the guarantee that we will be able to bequeath tofuture generations the legacy of a prosperous world."
"68",2779,"GNQ",57,2002,"﻿The delegation ofEquatorial Guinea congratulates you  Mr. President and the other members of the Bureau of this session ofthe General Assembly on their election to their posts.We wish them every success and offer them our fullcooperation. We also wish to convey to the outgoingPresident and Bureau the appreciation of EquatorialGuinea for their excellent work at a crucial time in thehistory of the United Nations.The delegation  the people and the Government ofEquatorial Guinea welcome the admission of the SwissConfederation to full membership in the UnitedNations. Switzerland is a country with whichEquatorial Guinea has excellent relations of friendshipand cooperation. This was indeed a historic event thatstrengthened and reaffirmed the principle of theuniversality of the United Nations. We also welcomethe forthcoming admission of Timor-Leste to theUnited Nations.I wish strongly to join Equatorial Guinea's voiceto the expressions of support and solidarity that havebeen heard from this rostrum towards the people andthe Government of the United States of America oneyear after the horror and the barbarity caused by theshameful terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.We reaffirm once again Equatorial Guinea's firmcommitment to the ceaseless fight against internationalterrorism and organized crime in all its forms andmanifestations  because this is a fight that involves allthe nations of the world  united by the ideal ofmaintaining peace  and because terrorism represents aserious challenge to humanity as a whole.Indeed  terrorism has become a sophisticatednetwork of political  economic and technical plottingthat transcends national borders. These are realorganizations that have the resources to carry outcriminal activity.Even more disturbing are manifestations of covertterrorism carried out under the pretext of defending andprotecting democracy and human rights. This leads usto declare that one cannot combat terrorism in certainareas and encourage it in others  depending on who thepotential victims may be. Equatorial Guinea and othercountries in our subregion continue to be victims ofthis ambiguity and contradiction. The demands madeon our countries and the conditionalities imposed on usin the name of promoting democracy and human rightsmust not serve as a pretext for encouraging intoleranceor political extremism or for instigating confrontationamong the various social groupings in a country so asto weaken its sense of unity and solidarity.15Time and again we have stressed the imperativeneed to preserve peace and security in the world. Theinternational community has to reactivate its machineryfor conflict prevention and settlement  because theseconflicts are a scourge on vast areas of the world ingeneral  and to the African continent in particular.Because of its geography  Equatorial Guinea isseriously concerned about constant serious threats tothe maintenance of peace and stability in CentralAfrica resulting from disputes and greed for theenormous natural resources located there. Because ofthe geo-strategic importance of the subregion  we wantto preserve a balance of force in the Gulf of Guinea and we want to preserve our area as a haven of peace stability and prosperity for our peoples.The United Nations must be vigilant  given thethreats to peace  security and stability in the Gulf ofGuinea. In the specific case of Equatorial Guinea  Iwould like to say that for over 25 years it was underUnited Nations supervision  vis-‡-vis human rights  butthat on 19 April 2002 at the fifty-eighth session of theUnited Nations Commission on Human Rightsresolution 2002/11 was adopted. The resolution endedthe Special Rapporteur's mission for human rights inEquatorial Guinea. The Commission on Human Rightstherein explicitly recognized the efforts made by ourGovernment and the progress made by our country inthe area of human rights and strengthening democracy.However  we were deeply distressed a few dayslater to see that our country was a victim of attemptedterrorist action against the life of individuals and socialpeace. Those responsible were arrested and will now betried under our law. Yet  some pressure groups withundeclared interests in Equatorial Guinea have spokenout and have been trying to use the forthcoming trial asa basis for launching a new campaign of defamationagainst my country in the face of these acts ofdestabilization. In addition  these groups are stillseeking to confuse the issue and to keep theinternational community uninformed as to the truepolitical  economic and social developments inEquatorial Guinea. These groups have been trying todisrupt a good climate of dialogue and understandingbetween our Government and the political forces in ourcountry. However  as concerns these manoeuvres  Iwould reaffirm to the international community ourresolve to preserve the spirit of trying to reachconsensus with all the political groupings in ourcountry to ensure that the forthcoming presidentialelections proceed smoothly.The situation we have just described is notpeculiar to Equatorial Guinea  because the samesituation can be seen in several countries in oursubregion. My country is resolved to ensure thatCentral Africa becomes an area of peace  solidarity andcooperation.We hail the initiatives under way to restore peaceto Angola  the Democratic Republic of the Congo andBurundi  and we commend the work of the UnitedNations to that end.The picture of conflict and instability in the worldtoday stands in stark contrast to our desire to encourageeconomic development and prosperity for all countriesof the world. Just a few days ago in Johannesburg  atthe World Summit on Sustainable Development  theinternational community undertook to work insolidarity to achieve the goals set at Rio de Janeiro  theMillennium Summit and Monterrey. To that end  it isessential that a new civilization and a new politicalculture bud and take root in the consciousness of theinternational community  recognizing once and for allthat all nations of the world  rich and poor  large andsmall  enjoy the same rights to peace  stability andprosperity. This is essential if we are to survive thecurrent crisis.This General Assembly faces the challenge ofresolving burning issues  such as combating HIV/AIDSand implementing the goals of the MillenniumDeclaration and the Johannesburg Consensus.My Government shares these concerns and urgesthat top priority be given to strengthening thedemocratic process and the rule of law  protectinghuman rights  ensuring good governance and achievingsustainable development. We also believe that thepeace process in the Middle East should beencouraged  along with the dialogue under waybetween North and South Korea  with a view topeaceful reunification.We also encourage democratization in the UnitedNations itself  so that it can strengthen its efforts in theworld as the principal guarantor of international peaceand security. This General Assembly session  just likethe meetings at Johannesburg and other summits provides an excellent opportunity  not for reviving ananachronistic confrontation between nations  but rather16for moving deeper into the area of reaching agreementand of holding a dialogue in the great debate for theprogress and prosperity of all peoples in the world."
"69",2825,"GRC",57,2002,"﻿The challenges weface at the beginning of the twenty-first century areimmense. We are facing terrible poverty; crises andwars; millions of refugees; the hideous face ofterrorism; trafficking in human beings  arms and drugs;and regions decimated by disease as we continue todestroy the earth's ecological balance.There are no simple answers to these problems.But there is a place where we all can meet to findsolutions: the United Nations. The world needs a strongUnited Nations.I have just quoted my Swiss colleague  first of allto celebrate his country's and East Timor's entry intothe United Nations  and secondly because I fully agreewith his statement.In the words of Kofi Annan:“The more a country makes use ofmultilateral institutions — thereby respectingshared values  and accepting the obligations andrestraints inherent in those values — the moreothers will trust and respect it  and the strongerits chance to exercise true leadership”. (SeeA/57/PV.2)I know the personal commitment of my dearfriend Jan Kavan  the President  to this principle. Ourtwo countries have worked closely in a common effortto promote peace  the rule of law and shared values inSouth-eastern Europe.Today we can be proud that we also contributedin changing this region. It is no longer “CNN-able”  asour colleague from Bosnia and Herzegovina  Mr.Lagumdjia  said yesterday.Yet this has not been an easy process.Take my country  Greece. In the previous century we went through two world wars  two Balkan wars anda major war with Turkey  which resulted in millions ofrefugees and in painful population exchanges. Wesuffered under civil war  famine and dictatorship. Wewitnessed the forced division of Cyprus throughmilitary invasion and occupation by Turkey  and therecent wars in the disintegrating former Yugoslavia inour backyard. Not far from us  conflict continues. Westand ready to support all efforts to ensure that Israel17may be secure and that the Palestinians may have aState they can call their own.It is no wonder that today we cherish the peacewe have achieved. It is no wonder that we cherish thefact that Greece today has its most stable democracy inmodern history  that we are among the more prosperouscountries in the world  and that we will soon be hostingone of the most demanding events humankind hascreated  the Olympics. This to us is a responsibility.We have learned our lessons. We are where weare today only because of our people's steadfastcommitment to work for the shared values ofdemocracy  peace  justice  and human rights.It is no wonder that Greece has become achampion of the enlargement of the European Union because the European Union is a community of values and being a community of values is the biggest peaceproject of our region. We have a responsibility to ourneighbours  from Turkey to Bosnia and Herzegovina to see them  sooner or later  part of this wider Europeanfamily — creating a new vision where all can share thevalues of peace and democracy and be citizens of theEuropean Union.We have learned that at the heart of theseconflicts are human beings  as the Danish PrimeMinister  Mr. Rasmussen  has said. We have learnedthat democracy and human rights are fundamental tothe life and dignity of all human beings.Whenever our global principles are violated  it isusually in societies and places where extremism andlack of democracy exist. I believe that democracy willisolate the phenomena that we have seen in recentyears  such as that of 11 September.We in Greece have also known terrorism. Wehave suffered at the hands of a small terroristorganization called November 17. Since June  Greeksecurity forces have brought all the key members ofNovember 17 to justice. This formidable achievementwas supported by assistance from allied intelligenceagencies  to which we are indebted for their support.This experience is just one more example of how closeinternational cooperation can accomplish commongoals and protect our common values. It is also atribute to our long-lasting democratic institutions.In the European Union  we are building not onlya community of nations but a community of values.The Greek presidency of the European Union  whichbegins in January 2003  will promote the values ofdemocracy and peace in every element of its agenda.We want to focus our efforts on reinforcing the trans-Atlantic relationship. We believe that the United Statesand the European Union share the same democraticvalues. We must stand united in our efforts to promotepeace within a multilateral framework.We also will pay tribute to the cultural diversitythat is at the heart of the European project  with a focuson reinvigorating democratic governance by renewingour efforts to build social inclusiveness and civilparticipation across borders  working with our newneighbours  from the Baltic region to theMediterranean  from the Atlantic to the Caucasus  anew neighbourhood of peace  cooperation anddemocracy.In this community of values  I should like to talkabout a case in point. A few years ago  the notion ofrapprochement between Greece and Turkey wasunthinkable. Now  with a common European vision our Governments are creating a framework to solveexisting problems  and citizen's diplomacy is buildinga bridge of peace between our nations. Athens andAnkara have concluded a number of agreements inareas ranging from energy to tourism  from educationto landmines  designed to ease tension and strengthenour common interests. While fundamental differencesremain on certain issues  in a short space of time  wehave come a long way — and we surely can go further.I welcome my discussion and meeting with the newMinister for Foreign Affairs  Mr. Gürel  and hiswillingness to continue on this path of rapprochementand peace.Yet our shared values are being sorely tested onthe issue of Cyprus. There is now a compellingdeadline for a resolution to the continuing division ofthe island. Negotiations for the accession of theRepublic of Cyprus to the European Union will befinalized in December. We hope that a free  unitedCyprus will join a free  united Europe. Unification willundoubtedly bring greater security and prosperity toboth the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities onthe island. But if a political settlement is not reached the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus willjoin alone. Let us therefore work to break down thewalls that keep future European Union citizens apart.With the exception of Turkey  the whole worldshares a vision for Cyprus as a federal State with a18single international personality and a single citizenship no foreign troops on its soil  and equal rights andsecurity guarantees for both the Greek and TurkishCypriot communities. The vast majority of the Cypriotpopulation agrees that the two communities can andshould live together  united by shared values  whilepreserving their individual cultural identities.We must respect United Nations resolutions onCyprus. They must be honoured  as my Maltesecolleague just repeated.Cyprus is also a critical factor for the stabilityand security of South-eastern Europe and the MiddleEast. A solution to this problem  therefore  will widenthe area of stability and peace throughout the region.Not much farther away  the situation in Iraq is achallenge for us all. It challenges our respect forinternational law and our respect for internationalorganizations. Greece vows to act in the way it sees fitto safeguard these valued principles.In dealing with Iraq  our actions must be guidedby evidence of a threat to global security  and must beembedded in respect for the well-being of the Iraqipeople. We must exhaust all available diplomaticmeans to ensure that Iraq complies with existingUnited Nations resolutions  immediately accepts theunconditional return of United Nations weaponsinspectors and destroys all weapons of massdestruction. This will free the people of Iraq from theeconomic sanctions  which are depriving them of theirbasic needs.We welcome the statement by President Bush. Bytaking the issue of Iraq back to the Security Council  hehas both challenged the Council and empowered it tomove forward more effectively and more credibly.Democracy is a value that should not be taken forgranted. It must be reinforced to meet new challengesin a globalizing world. In this spirit  Greece launched in Johannesburg  the first-ever online global poll onsustainable development and the environment.Electronic democracy offers tremendous potential forbridging the digital divide that separates many peoplesand individuals  for strengthening civil participationand for enhancing global democratic legitimacy andtransparency. We suggest that the United Nationsestablish a new global forum — an electronicDemos — where citizens could articulate their views mobilize around the issues that concern them and shapepolitical decision-making  both nationally andinternationally.Greece will make good on its commitment tosustainable development by taking concrete actions andidentifying specific targets.This year  many countries celebrated theestablishment of an institution that was founded on thepremise that good global governance must be built onsound global principles. The International CriminalCourt represents a commitment by our community ofnations that no crime against humanity will gounpunished. Creating a watertight system of globaljustice which requires all countries to uphold commonrules  principles and rights will be an important steptowards building a real community of global values.Finally  I would like to say that those values lie atthe heart of the Olympic Truce  which was endorsed bythe Millennium Summit and the MillenniumDeclaration. It is global peace initiative which was justrecently endorsed by the former President of SouthAfrica  Nelson Mandela. When he signed the OlympicTruce in June  President Mandela said:“The Olympic Games represent one of themost evocative moments of celebration of ourunity as human beings in pursuit of noble ideas.Among those ideas is the quest for global peace.”We uphold the values of democracy  humanrights  peace and sustainable development; they canenrich us all. They can inspire us and challenge us.They are values that can inspire change in one person in one community or in a large nation. They are valuesthat can change the life of not just one person  but theworld as a whole. These are the values upon which wemust build our future and the future of our children."
"70",2866,"GRD",57,2002,"﻿My delegationcongratulates Mr. Jan Kavan on his election asPresident of the fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly  and we thank his predecessor  Mr. HanSeung-soo  for his effective conduct of the fifty-sixthsession. We also pay tribute to the Secretary-Generalfor his enlightened and progressive leadership.In addition  we warmly welcome Switzerland intothe family of nations  and we look forward withpleasure to the admission of East Timor.When the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly was convened a year ago  shockwaves werereverberating across the United States and around theworld as a result of the traumatic and cataclysmicevents of 11 September. My country's thoughts andprayers continue to be with the people of the UnitedStates  especially those who have suffered irreparableloss. As the curtain rises on the fifty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly  there is evidence that some darkclouds have lifted  thanks to the solidarity of theinternational community  which has galvanized intotaking action to prevent such dastardly and heinousterrorist attacks.Nevertheless  there is a need for vigilance  asdemonstrated by the Counter-Terrorism Committeecreated to oversee the implementation of the landmarkSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). Grenada hasgiven its full support and commitment to this resolutionby using scarce financial and human resources toimplement security measures and new counter-terrorism strategies  including national legislation toconform with the resolution.In this connection  we appeal for assistance fromwilling partners in the fight against terrorism and theconcomitant trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropicsubstances that traverses our region via the CaribbeanSea. This waterway must be maintained as a zone ofpeace in the context of sustainable development  freealso from pollutants and nuclear waste.The general debate is taking place in thecontinuing shadow of 11 September  which hasadversely affected the global economy and the socialsituation in developed countries. However  thespillovers have affected  much more profoundly  smalldeveloping countries such as my own. Particularlyhard-hit has been the tourism industry  which is a majorsource of foreign exchange. Tourist arrivals by air andsea have decreased significantly  due in large measureto increased security arrangements introduced ininternational transportation and  of course  the naturalfear of travelling. Loss of revenue in tourism affectsthe hotel industry  employment  transportation banking  agriculture and other tourism activities thathelp to sustain the economy of my country.The next hardest hit sector is trade. Conventionaleconomic wisdom says that poor developing countriesmust grow their way out of poverty. Trade offers thebest hope  because it is the engine of growth anddevelopment.Many products from developing countries faceuntold obstacles in entering the markets of the richdeveloped countries. In this connection  the decline intrade  especially primary commodities  has a directrelation on developing countries' ability to importgoods essential for development. According to theManaging Director of the International Monetary Fund(IMF)  Mr. Horst Köhler  the true test of the credibilityof wealthy nations' efforts to combat poverty lies intheir willingness to open up their markets and phaseout trade-distorting subsidies in areas wheredeveloping countries have a comparative advantage  asin agriculture  processed foods  textiles  clothing andlight manufactures.Grenada fully understands the critical role thatinternational trade plays in the alleviation of poverty.However  improved market access is a necessity for thedevelopment of smaller nations. We  therefore  reiterateour call to the more developed nations to make aconcerted effort to reduce trade barriers and tariffs which impede poorer developing countries from fullparticipation in the global economy.One result of 11 September has been to furtherexacerbate the inequality between the developing andthe developed countries as trading partners in the freeplay of market forces. According to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD)  the challenge now is tomake the multilateral trading system moredevelopment-friendly.Now  more than ever  the concerns of developingcountries  enunciated at the third session of the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) in Seattle and emphasizedat the Fourth World Trade Organization MinisterialConference in Doha  should be the global agenda tofight poverty in developing countries. The Dohaministerial declaration  adopted in November of 2001 reaffirmed the need for special and differentialtreatment as stated in that paragraph 3 declaration:“We recognize the particular vulnerability of theleast developed countries ... we are committed ...to improving their effective participation in themultilateral trading system.” (TRADE/2002/1 pp. 9-10)In Grenada  our imports declined by 10.9 per centin 2001  following a 20 per cent increase just the yearbefore. Our exports performed even worse byregistering a 24 per cent decline in 2001  as comparedto a 13 per cent increase the previous year. The effecton our growth rate was not surprising. The economygrew by 3.4 per cent in 2001  compared to 6.6 per centin the year 2000.The HIV/AIDS pandemic casts a dark shadowover the General Assembly's global agenda. HIV/AIDShas become not only a health pandemic  but also athreat to the development of international peace andsecurity. This disease constitutes a global emergency as it affects every country of the world; not a singleone is immune. The Pan American Health Organizationhas reported that an estimated 2.8 million people in theAmericas are currently living with AIDS. Out of thatnumber  420 000 in the Caribbean are infected. TheCaribbean is second only to sub-Saharan Africa inincidence and mortality rates.HIV/AIDS poses a drain on the scarce resourcesof the small economies  like Grenada's  whoserevenues have been further negatively impacted by lastyear's horrific events. The Caribbean is facing aserious problem with the disease  and there is no waythat our small countries can stem the ravages ofHIV/AIDS without a massive infusion of resources.The Caribbean urgently needs financial andhuman resources for education and counselling inpreventative measures and treatment  with respect toHIV/AIDS and the opportunistic diseases  such astuberculosis and others. Moreover  the availability ofmedicine and the ability to purchase it constitute thegreatest challenge.12We applaud the establishment in 2002 of theGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria.We are also thankful to the Pan American HealthOrganization and the World Health Organization(WHO) representative offices for assistance in thefacilitation  implementation and technical evaluation ofmany projects in the Caribbean region. However  thereis much more to be done  and the costs areoverwhelming.The World Summit on Sustainable Development recently ended in Johannesburg  and its precursor  theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  held in Monterrey  and the conclusionsof the Millennium Summit are all blueprints forsustainable development. The common thread in all thefinal documents is poverty eradication. Poverty  hungerand disease constitute a chain of misery withdevastating physical  mental and psychologicalconsequences.The Secretary-General summarized the nature ofthe challenges to human development best in theintroduction of his report to the Preparatory Committeefor the High-level International IntergovernmentalEvent on Financing for Development:“As the new century dawns  there can be no taskmore urgent for the United Nations than thatfixed by the Millennium Summit of rescuing onebillion men  women and children from ‘abject anddehumanizing poverty'”. (A/AC.257/12  para.1)Grenada's stated position at the World Summit onSustainable Development is as follows: if sustainabledevelopment is to become a reality  our focus must beon the health and social well-being of the world'speoples. Clean water  unpolluted air and food securityare rights  not privileges.What is required now is not the elaboration offurther final documents  replete with grand phraseologyand pious pronouncements  but the implementation ofthe existing ones that are most appropriate to thehuman condition. This brings to mind the need toimplement the Barbados Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates (SIDS) embodied in Agenda 21.We are hopeful that there will be a comprehensivereview of the Barbados Plan of Action in 2004 inMauritius so that the difficulties that small islands facein the pursuit of sustainable development will beconsiderably reduced.As a matter of urgency  the United Nations  itsagencies and willing stakeholders and partners shouldseek to implement the first Millennium Goal: theeradication of extreme poverty and hunger by 2015.Grenada awaits the time when the United Nationswill include the Republic of China on Taiwan in itsmembership. The Government of Grenada has closeand collaborative ties with the Republic of China andhas witnessed its economic achievements  seendemonstrations of its democratic principles  and iscognizant of the dedication of its people tointernational norms and ideals. In this spirit Grenadacalls for the full membership of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan in the United Nations. We are convincedthat the Republic of China on Taiwan meets thestandards for United Nations membership  since it hasa democratic Government and possesses the attributesof a nation-State. Indeed  the Republic of China onTaiwan has tremendous potential to provide inputs forthe further development of the internationalcommunity  as recognized by the World TradeOrganization.The New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD)  conceptualized by African leaders andwelcomed at the Summit of the Group of Eightindustrialized countries (G-8)  represents an ideawhose time has come. The international community toowelcomed NEPAD a few days ago  when it waspresented by a high-level panel of African heads ofState or Government during the present session of theGeneral Assembly.Implementation of NEPAD in partnership withthe developed countries will mark the dawn of a newera for the economic development of Africa's abundantnatural resources. Thus  Africa  one of the largest andmost centrally located continents  can become thebreadbasket of the world. Grenada as part of theAfrican diaspora  hails NEPAD with great expectationand excitement.The United Nations has the ability  with theinvolvement of its Members  to make a difference. It isthe international forum that struggles with and attemptsto find solutions to difficult global problems. Grenadahas been watching closely the developments ininternational peace and security; economicdevelopment; social advancement and cooperation; the13fight against HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria andother threatening diseases; environmentalsustainability; and a plethora of other regional  nationaland international issues.For small countries such as Grenada  attendinginternational conferences presents a paradox. We aspireto be integrally involved in these importantconferences  yet financial constraints sometimesoutweigh the benefits of being in attendance. Ourabsence  as many other small nations would agree should not by any means be construed as a lack ofinterest. Enormous expectations and optimism must bebalanced with a degree of realism. My delegationassures the General Assembly that it fully supports theefforts of the United Nations to face the manychallenges that arise.However  we must ensure that the many decisionstaken at the United Nations summit conferences areimplemented. But the goals must be achievable andbeneficial to all Member States."
"71",2913,"GTM",57,2002,"﻿It isdifficult to come to New York at this time withoutrecalling the dreadful events of exactly one year ago which brought the whole of the internationalcommunity together in support of this country  and thiscity. On this occasion  we reiterate our solidarity andour conviction that the best way to cope with terrorismis within the multilateral framework  and above all hereat the United Nations.I also take this opportunity to convey ourappreciation to Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic ofKorea for his excellent presidency of the last session. Iwould also like to congratulate you most sincerely  Sir on having assumed the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at this session. I have no doubt that yourproven ability and recognized experience as anacademic  a statesman and an official in the CzechRepublic and abroad will enable you to guide ourdeliberations successfully. We also congratulate theSwiss Confederation and Timor-Leste  the former oneof the oldest countries in the world  and the latter theyoungest: one is now a full Member of theOrganization  and the other soon will be.I would like to address two subjects. The first isdevelopments within Guatemala  particularly regardingfulfilment of the peace agreements  in whosenegotiation and subsequent implementation the UnitedNations played such a significant part. The second areaI shall be addressing relates to our position on the mostimportant items on the agenda of this session.On the first subject  let me say that the past yearhas been marked by intense activity in Guatemala.There were important advances  but also somesetbacks. We confront an unfavourable internationalsituation that has had a negative effect on our economy.Conditions have been made more complex by a severedrop in the price of our traditional export products.Unusual rainfall patterns have affected theproduction of grain in several regions. I make thesepoints because it would certainly be easier to complyfully with the commitments contained in the peaceagreements in a context of economic expansion  insteadof having to do so in the face of serious fiscalrestrictions and increasing demands on ourGovernment.Yet we have made headway  even when we had totake decisions that were politically unpopular but thatwere necessary to attain the goals of the peaceagreements. This was the case with our tax reform which included an increase in the value added tax. Thatreform is already in force  and my Government hasthereby fulfilled one of the specific commitments ofthe peace agreements. This measure laid a financialfoundation without which the fulfilment of other peacecommitments and maintenance of macroeconomicstability would simply have been unthinkable.It has fallen to me to preside over the firstGovernment of Guatemala in the new era of peace. Thepeace agreements were our second declaration ofindependence and they mark the road to building atolerant and non-exclusionary society  a State that isdemocratic  participatory and where the rule of lawprevails.During my administration public expenditure hasfocused on education; but we also address  as mattersof priority  access to land and the reduction of poverty.Guatemala is a country of marked contrasts betweenwealth and poverty. We labour under age-oldconditions of injustice. We turned to the Government topromote reform for the well-being of our people particularly indigenous peoples  children  women peasants and the victims of the internal armed conflict.Reforms are essential in order to uphold democracy.8There is powerful resistance to change  and thiscarries political and even personal costs. But ourcommitment to democracy  social justice and equity isunshakeable.There are just too many things to do inGuatemala. After governing for three years  ourawareness of what is lacking makes us feel dissatisfied.On gender equality  we have made some progress onthe institutional plane  and we now  jointly with thewomen's movement  have forged an approach with theeffect of State policy.We are promoting educational reform  literacycampaigns  scholarships for girls in the rural areas andcountry-wide nutritional programmes in schools. Weare working also on poverty reduction strategies.These are long-range policies  whose results willbe fully enjoyed only by later generations. The recentenactment of three laws  a reformed municipal code a law on development councils and a law ondecentralization  forms the basis for the most far-reaching reform of the State to have occurred in 100years.The peace agreements are comprehensive in theirscope. We have promoted a substantive social agenda and we have adopted measures towards free markets.We have undertaken reforms in the area ofsecurity  although much remains to be done. Themilitary is now focusing increasingly on nationaldefence. We have reduced the number of militarypersonnel as well as their functions  and some of theresources thus freed up will be been used for publiceducation and civilian security services. Militaryreconversion  however  will not be easy; we will haveto make a special effort to achieve a smaller and betterequipped army. Civilians are preparing to take overmore complex roles and society is being called upon toparticipate in elaborating important public policies such as overall public security and national defence.We are fostering dialogue with civil society onimportant issues such as agriculture and ruraldevelopment  transparency  combating corruption andproviding compensation and reparation for victims ofarmed conflict. Our aspirations do not stop there however. Guatemala has not yet achieved fullreconciliation. We need to reconcile the elements ofour society and provide opportunities for developmentwithout excluding anyone. Essential steps for achievingreconciliation include identifying all the parties to theconflict  making symbolic gestures to repair thedamage done  finding out and acknowledging the truthabout what took place  allowing justice a free hand andpromoting forgiveness. Our nation has undertakenthese tasks in a diligent manner  although someuncertainty persists.My Government's term of office will expire in alittle over a year  by which time the United NationsVerification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) willbe planning to withdraw. The Mission has played afundamental role as the critical conscience of the Stateand has actively supported the fundamental changesthat have taken place. We appreciate the work that ithas done and we would like here to request theextension of its mandate to the end of 2004 so that itmay accompany us as we make the transition to a newAdministration. Our hope is that MINUGUA will handover its functions in an orderly manner to nationalbodies and  where appropriate  to the programmes andagencies of the United Nations.Let me turn now to the agenda for this session.First of all  I would like to reiterate our full andunconditional support for the United Nations as thehighest form of multilateralism. We are convinced thatthis Organization will have to play a crucial role in thetwenty-first century. We believe that the MillenniumDeclaration provides an adequate road map enabling usto set out our priorities and the steps to be taken tofulfil the goals set. Its implementation has been given apowerful boost by the Monterrey Consensus and thePlan of Action adopted in Johannesburg a few daysago. We also fully support the stewardship of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan.We agree that this Organization must adapt to thechallenges of globalization. We are aware that progresshas been made in this respect in recent years  but muchremains to be done. In this context  we look forwardwith great interest to the new reform proposals to besubmitted by the Secretary-General towards the end ofthe month. We pledge to participate actively inanalysing and debating them.Few would doubt that Security Council reform isthe most urgent of the outstanding reform efforts. Wemust not delay our efforts to ensure that that organ ismade more effective  representative and transparent. Tothat end  we advocate the expansion of the membershipof the Council and believe that the veto power should9be used strictly in conformity with the United NationsCharter.We also believe that it is necessary to strengthenthe General Assembly and the Economic and SocialCouncil so that the three principal organs of the UnitedNations mutually support one another. We reiterate ourtotal rejection of all forms of terrorism  and supportcollective action by the international community tocombat that scourge through  inter alia  action inaccordance with Security Council resolution 1373(2001).We believe that we must strengthen our collectivecapacity to prevent and resolve conflicts  whether of atransboundary or internal character. With regard todisarmament  we favour the complete elimination ofnuclear  chemical and bacteriological weapons  an endto the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons anda ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines and otherexplosive devices. We support all United Nationsactions aimed at achieving such goals as well as atestablishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in all parts ofthe world.We believe in particular that the United Nationsmust continue to address the development challenge.Working with the multilateral financial institutions  ourOrganization must play a crucial role in ensuring thatthe benefits of globalization are widely shared amongall countries. This will require common efforts withincountries and in the international community as awhole. Furthermore  Guatemala is a party to theprincipal environmental treaties  and we reiterate ourcommitment to maintaining the ecological equilibriumof the Earth.We recently made a contribution in this respectby offering to host the headquarters of the secretariat ofthe Convention for Cooperation in the Protection andSustainable Development of the Marine and CoastalEnvironment of the North-East Pacific. We participatedactively in drafting that Convention.My country is aware of the divisions betweensister peoples in the Middle East  Asia and Africa. Wefervently hope that it will be possible to resolve thosedifferences by peaceful means through dialogue so that without discrimination  all the peoples of the world canbe represented here. I would like to make specialreference to the 23 million people of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan  whose aspirations to participate inthe work of international organizations have not yetbeen fulfilled. The countries of Central America ingeneral  and Guatemala in particular  view thoseaspirations as beneficial to global peace anddemocracy; they deserve our support.It is likewise our earnest hope that a solution willbe found  based on security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973)  1397 (2002) and 1402 (2002) tothe difficult situation in the Middle East  which hasworsened over the past year.Finally  we reaffirm our strong support forCentral American integration and our commitment tothe other countries of Latin American and theCaribbean. The Government of Guatemala hasparticipated in important initiatives in the area ofregional and subregional integration. In thatconnection  I would like to point out that  inaccordance with a constitutional mandate  Guatemalahas done its best to strengthen bonds of friendship andgood-neighbourliness with the State of Belize  withoutprejudice to the active search for a peaceful honourable  equitable and permanent solution to ourterritorial dispute  which dates back over a century.On Monday  16 September  at the headquarters ofthe Organization of American States  therepresentatives of our two countries will be presentedwith the conclusions and recommendations of aconciliation process that has taken place under theauspices of that organization. Any definitive settlementwill have to be approved by referendum in Guatemala.We commend the solidarity displayed by theGovernment of the Republic of Honduras with a viewto facilitating amicably the delimitation of the maritimeareas in the Gulf of Honduras.In conclusion  I would like to quote a Guatemalanpoet  Otto RenÈ Castillo  who was a victim of internalarmed conflict. Fifty years ago  he wrote:Smiles will return to the face of humanity because children born in the twenty-first centurywill be happy.Our mission must be to make this come true.Such is the goal of our tireless struggle."
"72",2956,"GUY",57,2002,"﻿Over the Assemblyhangs a cloud of uncertainty — indeed  of unease —about the future of multilateralism and of internationalrelations generally. The tragedy of 11 September 2001 which we commemorated just three days ago  has sonumbed our minds that we have yet to fully understandits consequences. Therefore  it is meet that  as a familyof nations  we should not only remember the disaster but also seek to learn from it how we can best restoreto mankind some measure of faith and hope in ourcommon humanity.My delegation is pleased to see Mr. Jan Kavanpresiding over the Assembly  since  as therepresentative of a country that has known the horrorof war  he will undoubtedly inspire us to find our wayforward. In wishing his presidency well  I would alsolike to place on record our gratitude to His ExcellencyMr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of Korea for21guiding us through a most difficult and challengingtime. Our appreciation and thanks must also extend tothe Secretary-General  who  throughout these pastmonths  has helped to sustain our commitment to thepurposes and principles of the United Nations.We are pleased to welcome Switzerland as a fullmember of the family of nations  and we look forwardto doing the same for East Timor when it takes its placeamong us.The international system is now plagued bydangerous instability which threatens to undermine —if not to destroy — many of our States. Not only do weface terrorism  with its horrific violence  but we mustalso live with other manifestations of terror in the formof poverty  hunger and disease  which  although moresilent  are no less deadly.Conflict  both within and among States  clearlydemonstrates how poorly an economy functionswithout political and social cohesion. Divisions thatrend the fabric of our societies — divisions that deriveultimately from ethnicity and race — are not onlyseverely counterproductive to our attempts to better thecommonweal  but preclude the emergence of thedurable peace and tranquillity without which we willnever be able to prosper.Recent global conferences have focused ourattention on the importance of a rights-based approachto social inclusion. However  commitment to inclusivepolicies rests not only with States but with civil societyas a whole. Poverty and underdevelopment are noweasily exploited by some elements in our societies toundermine the authority of democratically electedGovernments and to exacerbate ethnic and othertensions.This instability is further compounded by therampant trade in illegal drugs and arms  with itsattendant corruption and violence  which daily tests thelegal  financial  security and governance capabilities ofmost small States. The social contract between theState and its citizens has been seriously jeopardized bythese new political developments. Greater nationalendeavours and international solidarity are nownecessary if we are to confront these challenges andensure the economic and social progress of ourpeoples.Old conflicts persist  denying entire populationsthe opportunity to live in peace and security. Thesituation in the Middle East must be of special concernto us all  since it threatens to become a wider conflict.The right of the Palestinian people to national self-determination — a right guaranteed by internationallaw — must be upheld if there is to be a just andlasting solution to the region's problems.The tensions which exist in India-Pakistanrelations with regard to Kashmir should not be allowedto persist  given the risk of calamitous nuclear conflict.As a country which is committed to the pacificsettlement of disputes and as a friend of those twoimportant countries of Asia  from which many of ourown ancestors originated  Guyana wishes to encouragethem to continue their search for a definitive solution.Global instability results also from our failure toimplement the Agenda for Development. After morethan a decade of development-related conferences  wehave yet to grasp fully the implications forinternational cooperation of an increasinglyinterdependent world and a globalized economy. Therecent meetings in Doha  Monterrey and Johannesburgbrought the international community full circle inassessing the effectiveness of global collective actionaimed at the realization of the millennium developmentgoals and the eradication of poverty. We should now befully persuaded that global action remainsindispensable to the development process.What is less clear  however  is the relationshipthat should underlie such action  which continues to bea daunting challenge. To what extent can equality beachieved in a system of skewed economic and militarypower? Will sovereignty ever subject itself to theimperatives of the global good? How can trustworthyprocedures be found for international intervention insituations characterized by the threat of collapse ofnational social and economic structures? What morecan be done so that the current international tradingsystem is beneficial for all States  not for only a selectfew? How can the policies of the Bretton Woodsinstitutions be made more responsive to the concernsand needs of the developing countries in particular?I know that there are no easy answers to thesequestions. Indeed  each international conference andevery general debate that takes place in this Assemblyhas made us more aware of how difficult it is to find aconsensual approach to these issues. Dialogue andengagement are continuously balanced against hastyattempts to achieve short-term goals. Yet the22imperative of global stability — both political andeconomic — requires a greater symbiotic relationshipamong States. The increased permeability of borders which has made all countries vulnerable to contagionfrom outside  is a reality which we cannot ignore.Meanwhile  the debate on the benefits ofglobalization is becoming increasingly polarized.Despite their own best efforts at reform andrestructuring  many developing countries have notreally seen any significant improvement in theireconomic and social condition. The growth rate ofmost developing countries was 2 per cent lower in the1990s than it was in the oil crisis years of the 1970s.Similarly  although the number of people living inextreme poverty  on less than one dollar a day  hasreportedly decreased the past 15 years  those living onless than two dollars a day — an insignificant sum —has increased. Thus  poverty figures have in effectremained high  despite an improvement in worldincome over the past decade by an average of 2.5 percent annually.The situation has been especially difficult forsmall States. Over the past 10 years  the Statesmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) of which we are one  have been pursuing aggressivesocio-economic reform measures designed to enhancethe region's economic competitiveness so as to benefitfrom globalization. The results have generally beendisappointing  in large part due to the small size  andthe geographic location of the CARICOM countries  aswell as their limited natural resource base and highdependence on international trade  all of which maketheir economies vulnerable to changes in the globaleconomy. The situation is further aggravated by thehigh incidence of HIV/AIDS — the second highest inthe world.Small States such as ours in the Caribbean requiredevelopment cooperation that is based on mutual trustand the fulfilment of commitments. One major step inthis direction should be to focus on new ways ofbalancing equity  economics and ecology in order tocreate opportunities for small economies withoutinflicting disillusionment and despair. Every effortshould also be made to ensure the full implementationof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiativeso as to liquidate the debt burden in the poorestcountries. To address the challenge of development  anintegrated strategy must be found to address all thedifferent elements of the problem.Now — especially since Monterrey — it isfashionable to speak of partnership for sustainabledevelopment. Indeed  partnership  if properlyconceived and implemented  can serve to eradicatepoverty and promote economic growth. However  asthe President of Guyana stated at the World Summit onSustainable Development  in Johannesburg  if it is tosucceed  partnership between States must be based noton double standards but on mutual trust and respect andon the interests of all parties. Public/private-sectorpartnerships must be founded on equity andtransparency  with full regard to the laws of ourcountries. Finally  partnerships with multilateralfinancial institutions must be informed more by anunderstanding of the situation in our countries and lessby a doctrinaire approach to policy-making. To quotethe President directly  “Progress will only come if thereis an enlightened understanding of partnership.”Concerned by the inadequacy of pastdevelopment models and the trend towards leavingdevelopment matters largely to market forces  Guyanahas sought to promote at the United Nations theconcept of a new global human order based on agenuine partnership for cooperation. By addressing theproblems of peace and development in a holisticmanner  this “concordat” would provide developingcountries with the structural  strategic and long-termsupport that they need. Guyana hopes to build uponresolution 55/48 in the coming months with the aim ofbringing greater predictability and stability tointernational development cooperation.It is clear that the period ahead of us is fraughtwith difficulty  and that some of the challenges arehistorically unprecedented in scale. The instability anduncertainty by which so many societies around theworld are afflicted must be attended to if we are toavoid failure. We must therefore ready the UnitedNations  the most important and most widely supportedinternational governmental organization in existence to address these problems. There is simply nowhereelse to take them."
"73",3002,"HND",57,2002,"﻿The recognized leadership of Mr. Jan Kavanwill guarantee the success of our debates. Togetherwith congratulating him on his election to thepresidency  I should like to assure him that he cancount on my Government's full cooperation in hiswork.I come to this universal forum on behalf of apeople which last November renewed its commitmentto democracy. Representing the constitutionalGovernment headed by Mr. Ricardo Maduro Joest  whohas made the welfare of his people the essence of hismandate  I come with a message of peace andfriendship from Honduras addressed to all the nationsgathered here.My country's Government  born of the will of thepeople through a free and transparent election regardedas a model  has in a few months brought about changesthat have strengthened Honduran democracy. It hasimplemented historic institutional reforms  such as thedepoliticization of the Supreme Court of Justice  thedisallowing of participation in the presidential electionfrom positions of political advantage  the creation of ahigher accounting tribunal to exercise overall monetarycontrol  and the depoliticization of the nationalelectoral tribunal. Moreover  it has developed civilsecurity schemes and measures that are effective andrespectful of human rights  all within a context oftransparency in administrative management and a head-on campaign against corruption and extreme poverty.As a Government  we are doing what weresponsibly must do  and in that work we wish tocontinue to rely on the friendly and respectfulassistance of the international community  to which welikewise offer our solidarity and cooperation.Moreover  I come to the Assembly with the firm37resolve to associate my country with the efforts of allMember States to realize fully the purposes andprinciples of the San Francisco Charter. I come to theOrganization also to offer my Government'scooperation in the building of peace  in themaintenance of international security and in the forgingof a global alliance for human development.The day 11 September 2001 is an indelible date inthe history of humanity. The unprecedented terroristattacks changed for ever the face of New York  theiron Babel'  which  despite its great sorrow and grief continues to offer us its hospitality. Thousands offamilies belonging to many peoples of the UnitedNations  including mine  were plunged into grief andpain on that fateful day. Our condolences and solidarityare with them.As it did on that tragic occasion  the Governmentof Honduras condemns terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations. Accordingly  I take this opportunity toreaffirm in this world forum our unswervingcommitment to use all our skill and energy to combatthis scourge that threatens civilized coexistence amongnations. With the same conviction  Honduras reaffirmsits resolve to cooperate with other democratic nationsin the common undertaking to eradicate this evil  thusbuilding a better and less violent world.Since 11 September 2001  many things havechanged. However  other threats persist and continue toloom over our peoples  making increasingly imperativethe quest for new consensus and greater commitments.Following the Millennium Summit  three conferencesat the highest level and of the most far-reachingimportance have been held in recent months. Our headsof State or Government met first in Monterrey toconsider the issues of financing for development  laterin Rome to address the problem of world hunger and most recently  in Johannesburg to debate the greatchallenges of sustainable development. From each ofthose conferences  we have emerged moderatelysatisfied in terms of concrete results. However  werecognize that the dialogue must continue so that wecan together seek new forms of cooperation to alleviatethe hunger and pain of a large part of humanity  whosevery survival is in danger as a result of the vortex ofeconomic development taking place at the cost of theplanet's destruction.All of those commitments demand a UnitedNations revitalized in its action and strengthened in itsinternal structure. The time has come to reconsidercreatively and with greater determination theorganizational structure of the Security Council  anorgan that cannot continue to turn its back on a realityis very different from that of 1945. Honduras will notrest in its insistence on the need to abolish or restrictthe right of veto enjoyed by some Members of theOrganization. Likewise  my country believes that theStates contributing to development should have a seatand participate in the debate and work of that importantUnited Nations organ.The time has come to join in our resolve to seekmechanisms and decisions that will secure the fullparticipation of all the peoples and nations of the Earth.It is time for those who have been Members of theOrganization to return. For that reason  Hondurasbelieves that we should not continue the practice ofexcluding from our debates and our work concreterealities such as Taiwan  a country whose participationcould offer new opportunities for cooperation for thebenefit of many peoples  and which  in turn couldbenefit from our activity and decisions.In essence  Honduras pleads for a new UnitedNations in which all peoples and nations enjoy fullrepresentation and in which there is more just andbalanced representativity in the discussions and in theresultant resolutions. In this context  Honduraswelcomes the accession of Switzerland and theincorporation of Timor-Leste into our worldOrganization. I take this opportunity to wish them thewarmest of welcomes.In the broad and comprehensive vision of what  inmy Government's opinion  this Organization should be special mention must be made of the InternationalCourt of Justice  since it is the jurisdictional organ ofthe United Nations system and all States Members havecommitted themselves to complying with its decisionsin the cases to which they are party.Just as Honduras endorses the principles andpractices of international law that promote humansolidarity  respect for the self-determination of peoples non-interference and the safeguarding of universalpeace and democracy  we also proclaim the validityand compulsory application of international arbitrationand judicial rulings to be irrevocable. Consistent withthis state philosophy  my country is absolutelyconvinced that compliance with international rulingshanded down by a competent international court  as38well as good-faith compliance with the commitmentsundertaken by means of treaty  will guarantee peace harmony and security among peoples andGovernments.Honduras feels that the very credibility of acountry is at stake when it complies or fails to complywith the obligations arising from an internationalruling. As for Honduras  the resolution of a competentinternational court has constitutional weight and itseffects require immediate execution  for we believethat law and legality are unshirkable imperatives of thenew international order. Moreover  in myGovernment's opinion  they are the cornerstone ofinternational society in this century.Prompted by this conviction  in January mycountry turned to the Security Council  in its capacityas guarantor of the implementation of the rulings of theInternational Court of Justice  in seeking the requisitecooperation to ensure compliance with the ruling thatthe Court handed down 10 years ago in the disputewhich  by common agreement with the Republic of ElSalvador  we submitted to it for consideration anddecision. Recent events in our countries have led us tobelieve that the implementation of the ruling will beginvery soon as a result of talks between the Presidents ofthe two nations. We sincerely hope that this may be thecase  both because we do not wish to distract theSecurity Council's attention from this matter  which isof importance to our peoples and to the validity ofinternational public law itself  and because we wish topromote the process of integration to which the wholeof Central America is now committed.The Central American isthmus is going through aspecial moment in its history. There is a resolve amongour Governments to grasp the future together and accordingly  we have agreed to promote the creation ofa customs union among the partners of the regionalintegration system  which should be established byDecember 2003. This renewed integration  as we callit  offers opportunities both for our collectivity and forour neighbours and partners in development  as in thecase of Mexico with the Puebla-Panam· plan.Important challenges are also being met in concert such as the negotiation of a free-trade treaty with theUnited States of America. We intend later to repeat theexperience with the European Union.Despite the significant progress that has beenmade  and as in other regional systems of States practices persist that impede the full development ofour trade relations. Fortunately  we are striving toovercome these obstacles through dialogue andsolutions appropriate to civilized nations whichunderstand that  given our common past  we share acommon future.At the present time  there are grounds for graveconcern in the face of events and realities that threateninternational peace and security. The situation in theMiddle East has been a constant cause of concern toall. Honduras appeals to the men and women of thatregion to repudiate and renounce violence and thusgive peace a chance for the sake of a generation ofchildren who see and experience nothing but violenceas they grow. This and other bloody conflicts require usto rethink and reformulate new ideas for prompt action.We need to globalize solidarity and humandevelopment. The great challenges of this centuryrequire us to increase the worldwide presence of theUnited Nations Development Programme  the WorldFood Programme  the World Health Organization  theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization  the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme and other entities and agencies of oursystem  whose work effectively contributes toestablishing the conditions to ensure that all boys  girls men and women of all ages  regardless of their ethnicorigin  colour or religious creed  may live in anenvironment conducive to the full exercise of theirrights.In this context  the peoples of the world arecalling for concerted action on the part of ourGovernments to make the United Nations the world'smost efficient Organization for addressing thechallenges posed by the millions of men  women andchildren infected by the HIV virus; by others  sufferingunemployment  who have entered the most destitutesectors of society; and by the more than 40 millionboys and girls who wander or simply live on thestreets.Over time  crimes against humanity havemotivated concerted action on the part of all peoples todevelop new and advanced schemes for internationalprotection. That is the case with the new InternationalCriminal Court  to which Honduras is honoured to beparty. We applaud this revolutionary effort in theadministration of criminal justice and hope that  sooner39rather than later  all the States Members of the UnitedNations will join it.I wish to conclude my statement by emphasizingthat the great challenges we face in today's worlddemand concerted and global action. If we truly wishto see the planet survive and  with it  the human race the time has come to work together responsibly toforge real partnerships for human development andsustainable development for all the peoples of theUnited Nations."
"74",3026,"HRV",57,2002,"﻿At the outset  allowme to sincerely congratulate Mr. Kavan on his electionto the position of President of the fifty-seventh sessionof the General Assembly. I am confident that under hisable leadership the work of the Assembly will beconducted in a most productive manner. I would alsolike to use this opportunity to thank the outgoingPresident  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for the successfulcompletion of the work of the fifty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly. I would also like to use thisopportunity to warmly congratulate Switzerland onbecoming a full member of the United Nations familyand to welcome the return of the United States to theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization.Following the horrific terrorist attacks of 11September last year  there have emerged a new vigourand resolve to make our world a safer place for all  notonly in promises but in deeds.General Assembly and Security Councilresolutions  especially Security Council resolution1373 (2001)  serve as a common platform forcombating terrorism. However  their letter and spiritmust be fully and thoroughly implemented in order torid ourselves of global terrorist threats. In ourendeavours  the United Nations is proving to be thebest framework and unique pillar for the internationalcommunity's joint actions in maintaining internationalpeace and security  as well as in providing legitimacyto these actions.13The prompt and almost universal response ofMember States to the requests of the Security Council'sCounter-Terrorism Committee is a telling example ofhow efficient the United Nations can be in mobilizingthe international community in facing commonchallenges. It is our hope that Member States willrespond with the same sense of responsibility inanother important aspect of eradicating terrorism: tofinalize current negotiations on the comprehensiveconvention on combating international terrorism.Furthermore  Croatia believes that efforts shouldbe intensified to resolve regional conflicts that offerfertile ground for recruiting terrorists. The cycle ofviolence in the Middle East must end. Parties to theconflict must return to the negotiating table and make areality of the vision of two peoples living in peacewithin secure and recognized State borders.We also call for Iraq's full compliance with itsinternational obligations regarding the possession andproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.Violations of Security Council resolutions must not betolerated  and we welcome the decision by PresidentBush to work with the United Nations Security Councilin this regard.We must also recognize that today Afghanistan ison a difficult yet hopeful road to recovery with theassistance of the international community.We fully support the Secretary-General in hisefforts to move the United Nations from a culture ofreaction to one of prevention. We consider that thetimely dispatch of well-structured peacekeepingoperations with a clear and effective mandate canprevent the recurrence of conflicts and create aplatform for rebuilding peace and shattered societies. Itis exactly here that new tasks and challenges lie forcontemporary peacekeeping operations  whose birth wehave witnessed in East Timor and Kosovo. In thisregard  we welcome the Security Council's newapproach of having regular meetings with troop-contributing countries. As a contributor of militaryobservers in peacekeeping missions in Sierra Leone Ethiopia and Eritrea and recently in Kashmir  Croatiahas found that exchange of information and experiencemost fruitful and useful for all.That brings me to the subject of Security Councilreform  which  as all of us agree  is necessary toaddress the new political environment of the twenty-first century. Unfortunately  we have still not achievedsufficient political consensus for significant progress inthis respect. The lack of progress is certainlydiscouraging for many. Nevertheless  we must reformthe Council in order to be able to adequately addressthe security threats we are facing today.As we revisit the historic promises made by ourworld leaders  enshrined in the MillenniumDeclaration  we must now embark on a process ofimproving the United Nations as an instrument ofglobal co-operation for the benefit of all humankind. Inthis regard  we commend the Secretary-General for hisreport on the integrated and coordinatedimplementation of  and follow-up to  the outcome ofthe major United Nations conferences and summits  asa necessary prerequisite to implementing the goals setin the Millennium Declaration. To that end  the full andconstant co-operation of Member States and theSecretariat is essential.The Economic and Social Council has continuedon the path of strengthening its role within the UnitedNations system. A number of innovative precedentshave been set this year related to the improvement ofcooperation and coordination among many bodies ofthe United Nations and between the Economic andSocial Council and the International Monetary Fundand the World Bank  and to the Council's cooperationwith non-governmental organizations and the privatesector. The resolution concerning the Ad Hoc AdvisoryGroup on African Countries emerging from conflictswas adopted to help such countries in their peace-building processes. Guinea-Bissau has alreadysubmitted an official request for the establishment ofsuch an Ad Hoc Advisory Group for its own country.Croatia is pleased that it can contribute  through thePresident of the Economic and Social Council  to therevival and strengthening of that highly importantbody.The United Nations should continue to keepdevelopment at the forefront of all areas on theOrganization's substantive agenda. Among allmultilateral organizations  the United Nations is theonly one with the institutional capability to address andmanage the challenges of globalization. The Croatiandelegation hopes that the outcome and follow-up of theconferences held at Monterrey and Johannesburg willkeep our commitment on track  in particular withregard to mobilizing additional financial resources. We14must work together to improve the lives of people inpoverty and to reverse the continuing degradation ofthe global environment. A truly global mobilization ofall relevant stakeholders will be necessary to ensurethat the outcomes of those conferences are transformedinto reality.We note the broader acceptance by MemberStates of United Nations norms  which will ultimatelylead to the globalization of human rights and to auniversally recognized international code of humanrights. As Governments  we must provide theenvironment for the universal acceptance and fullimplementation of such rights. Croatia is contributingto that goal through its membership in the UnitedNations Commission on Human Rights.Global contributions comprise individualachievements. In order to contribute to global peace security and development  each country must be stableand secure and must function on a well-foundedeconomic system. My Government is doing exactlythat. In October last year  Croatia signed theStabilization and Association Agreement with theEuropean Union. Over the past two years  we haveintroduced a set of reforms aimed at bringing Croatiansociety closer to the European Union and to the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization. The commitment of theCroatian Government in that respect was recognized bythe European Commission. In its first report on thestabilization and association process  issued this pastspring  Croatia was singled out as the country mostadvanced in the process.Another important element in that regard isregional cooperation  in which Croatia plays a veryactive role. The outstanding issues that may reflect onthe region's stability  such as the return of refugees  arehigh on my Government's priority list. Therefore Croatia has adopted an action plan for the voluntaryreturn of refugees through the end of the next year.We have significantly improved bilateral relationswith the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and willcontinue to do so. In the light of the discussionbetween the two delegations held just a few days ago  Ibelieve that the remaining open issues will besuccessfully resolved in the near future. One of thoseissues is the identification and delimitation of the landand sea border in the area of Prevlaka. Intensivenegotiations are under way  and we believe that someform of temporary solution may be reached soon. Inany event  the situation concerning Prevlaka no longerrepresents a threat to peace and security  and thereforewe believe that the United Nations Mission ofObservers in Prevlaka has successfully accomplishedits mandate and that  consequently  that mandate shouldnot be extended after it expires.With regard to border issues  I would like toreport an important success: an agreement on thenorthern part of our border with Bosnia andHerzegovina. That agreement was reached through thevaluable efforts of the Special Representative of theSecretary-General in Bosnia and Herzegovina  whomwe sincerely thank. At this point  shortly before the endof the United Nations presence in Bosnia andHerzegovina  I would like to express my Government'sappreciation for the Organization's overall contributionto the stability and development of that country.On the other hand  we cannot fail to express ourdeep frustration at the continued failure to apprehendtwo of the most notorious war criminals to date:Karadzić and Mladić. We strongly reiterate the viewthat lasting stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina can beachieved only with the arrest of Karadzić and Mladićand with their extradition to the appropriate authorities.Bringing those two individuals to trial before theInternational Criminal Tribunal for the FormerYugoslavia would serve to provide closure for manyvictims who suffered terribly. The same goes forSljivanćanin and Radić  indicted by the Tribunal forwar crimes committed on Croatian territory.Having faith in the maxim No peace withoutjustice'  my Government attaches the highestimportance to bringing to justice all those guilty of warcrimes. We are committed to maintaining the good andextensive cooperation that we have established with theInternational Criminal Tribunal for the FormerYugoslavia  and we urge other countries within itsmandate to do so. However  that does not diminish thekey role that domestic war crimes trials play in theprocess of healing and national reconciliation. TheCroatian judiciary is ready and willing to meet thesechallenges.In that spirit  the Republic of Croatia welcomedthe entry into force of the Rome Statute and looksforward to the operationalization of the InternationalCriminal Court. The establishment of the first suchpermanent Court is crucial in putting an end to theculture of impunity and selective justice. By15strengthening the universal rule of law  which in turnleads to the advancement of universal peace andsecurity  the new Court holds the promise of becominga true guarantor of the ideals enshrined in the Charterof the United Nations.Our fundamental and common interests in worldpeace  security and development require our concertedand united efforts. I am confident that this fifty-seventhsession of the General Assembly will take us a stepfurther in realizing those common goals."
"75",3071,"HTI",57,2002,"﻿On behalfof the President of the Republic of Haiti  HisExcellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide  I should first ofall like to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his election tothe presidency of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. He can be assured of the Haitiandelegation's full support in the exercise of his duties. Ishould also like to congratulate his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo  on the talent hedemonstrated in conducting the work of the fifty-sixthsession.I should also like to pay tribute to Mr. KofiAnnan  Secretary-General of the Organization  for hisceaseless efforts to maintain international peace andsecurity.In addition  I wish to welcome the SwissConfederation and East Timor to the Organization asStates Members. Undoubtedly  their presence in thisinstitution will contribute significantly to the pursuit ofthe noble objectives of the United Nations.The entire world has just commemorated the firstanniversary of the tragedy of 11 September 2001. TheGovernment and the people of Haiti again express theirsympathy to the people and the Government of theUnited States. We continue to share the distress of allthe families of the victims of that barbarity  whichtouched all races  cultures and nations of the world. Itis humanity that has been struck  and humanity willalways remember that sad event.The Government of Haiti reaffirms itscondemnation of terrorism  one of the most flagrantforms of human rights violations. Terrorism representsa grave danger  and we must unite all our efforts tocombat it in all its forms and manifestations. In thatconnection  my Government reaffirms its commitmentto supporting the relevant resolutions of theOrganization as an expression of its respect for theprecepts of international law.Reform of the Security Council  which has beendiscussed for some time  is  more than ever before  ofthe highest importance. Haiti continues to call for more25openness in its operations and for greater participationin its decision-making.The Charter of the United Nations  ratified by allStates Members  evokes the sacred principles ofmaintaining international peace and security as well asthe right of peoples to determine their own future withthe leaders they choose.In that connection  the Government of Haitiexpresses its grave concern at the escalating violence inthe Middle East  and particularly the Israeli-Palestinianconflict. The Haitian Government supports the creationof a Palestinian State  while recognizing Israel's rightto exist within safe and internationally recognizedborders. We call on the parties to settle theirdifferences peacefully through dialogue and diplomaticmeans.In the same spirit  we appreciate the negotiationsinitiated between the two Republics of Korea  and weare in favour of a rapprochement between thepopulations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.Despite Iraq's acceptance of the unconditionalreturn of the inspectors  the Haitian Government isconcerned at developments in the Iraqi situation. Inorder to deal effectively with this problem  the relevantUnited Nations resolutions must be applied.Regionalization is an important tool to facilitatepartnerships among States as they strive to ensure thewell-being of their people. In that context  my countryis gratified by its full integration within the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM)  where it will contribute tothe socio-economic development of the region.Humanity today is facing serious challenges including poverty  the AIDS pandemic  drug abuse hunger and illiteracy. The population of the leastdeveloped countries is about 614 million  one third ofwhom have to survive on less than $1 per day.Characterized by weak institutions and an inadequateinfrastructure  those countries are affected by manydifferent problems. The sub-human conditions underwhich many of their people live are a source of socialtension. Poverty increases in proportion as capitaldecreases.We returned from the Doha  Monterrey andJohannesburg summits with renewed hope.Expectations are great  in keeping with the promisesmade. It is not enough  however  to hope forsustainable development. We must have the will toimplement measures to attain it and respect thecommitments undertaken. Leaders must take action toensure sustainable development  which is in the bestinterests of our peoples.Education and training can roll back poverty  freepeople from ignorance and put them on track to socialand economic progress. On the basis of that conviction the President of Haiti  Mr. Jean Bertrand Aristide officially launched  on 7 September 2001  a nationalliteracy campaign  to which he attributes overridingimportance. The goal of this large-scale and ambitiousinitiative is to help 3 million people learn to readbefore 1 January 2004  when we will celebrate thebicentennial of our independence. The head of State iscounting on the active participation of our literatecitizens in the work of national construction.Glaring injustices are built into our country'straditional socio-economic system. These injustices areresponsible for wide disparities between the varioussocial sectors — a situation that contributes in largepart to the anachronistic nature of the generalstructures of our country  which is the only leastdeveloped country in the Americas.Against that background  the Government hasbeen doing its utmost to fight the financial embargo which the international community imposed inresponse to the controversy of the elections of 1 May2000. Unfortunately  it is the most vulnerable sectors ofsociety that are penalized by those unjustifiedsanctions.The recent adoption by the Permanent Council ofthe Organization of American States (OAS) ofresolution 822 in support of strengthening thedemocratic process in Haiti has opened up encouragingprospects for our country in beginning to move towardsnormalization.My Government is determined to stay the coursein ensuring that elections remain a crucial element ofthat advance. We have great expectations of theinternational community's support in this regard. Inthis context  we are hoping for assistance  and forelection observers in particular. At the same time  inthe spirit of resolution 822  we appeal once again as amatter of urgency for an end to the financial embargo.The adoption of OAS resolution 822  whichdemonstrates the commitment to Haiti of a number ofOAS member countries  constitutes a step in the right26direction. We would like to draw attention to thatexpression of fraternal solidarity.We are also grateful to the States members ofOAS whose joint efforts made possible the adoption ofthat consensus resolution  in particular the FederalRepublic of Brazil  which currently coordinates theLatin American Integration Association and OASgroups  and the Central American countries. We wouldlike to make special mention of our neighbour  theDominican Republic  which has continued to reaffirmits solidarity with Haiti during this difficult period —solidarity that is manifested in different ways whereverthe Haitian cause is discussed and needs to bedefended. Above all  we would like to thank our sisternations in CARICOM  whose delegations to the OASco-sponsored  with Haiti  the draft resolution  therebymaintaining the spirit of fraternal generosity  as is theircustom.During the crisis  a number of countries Membersof the United Nations  in particular Japan and Cuba continued to cooperate with Haiti. Despite the embargoand the other difficulties that it has to deal with  Cubais enthusiastically pursuing a programme ofcooperation with Haiti  in particular in the areas ofhealth and agriculture. The Haitian people owe a debtof gratitude to all of those countries for theirexpressions of solidarity in our quest for dignity andcollective affirmation.OAS resolution 822 provides the entire nationwith an opportunity; it holds out the potential forprogress for all the Haitian people. In the context of theforthcoming celebrations of two centuries ofindependence  Haiti needs to galvanize its collectiveenergy so that we can build our national home. To thatend  the Haitian Government will hold an ongoingdialogue and continue to practise openness andflexibility  as called for by President Aristide. In thatspirit  despite our well-known scarcity of resources  ithas decided to compensate the victims of 17 December2001  in accordance with OAS resolutions 806 and822. Likewise  President Aristide will continue to callon the opposition to observe a patriotic truce in orderto facilitate the rehabilitation of the country andsupport the Haitian people.In this context  my country appeals once again forus to place human beings at the forefront of relationsamong various countries. This planet — the theatre ofour common destiny — can thus become a world fit forall of its inhabitants through the advent of a“humanism without borders”. On that basis of thatconviction  the Republic of Haiti  on the eve of thebicentenary of our independence  invites theinternational community to help us to set in motion aprocess that will enable us to overcome the shockingreversals of the past and bring us into the modernworld.I hope that all of the nations of the world sharethese exalted hopes and that they will join us incelebrating this important event  to which theGovernment and the people of Haiti invite them  inJanuary 2004."
"76",3117,"HUN",57,2002,"﻿Let me at the outsetextend to His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan  formerForeign Minister of the Czech Republic  our sincerecongratulations upon his election as President of thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I wantto assure him that he can safely count on the fullsupport of my delegation in discharging his importantresponsibilities.I would also like to welcome in our midst thelatest new State Member of the United Nations Switzerland.It was only four days ago  when so many of ushere paid tribute at Ground Zero to the memories of thethousands of victims who lost their lives last year inthe brutal 11 September terrorist attacks. Theremembrance there was heartbreaking  but at the sametime it was a day of resolve as well. There is no doubtin my mind: this was a time that again brought intofocus our deep commitment to freedom and democracy.In that regard  I would like to reiterate that the peopleand the Government of Hungary continue to maintainrelentlessly their strong solidarity with the UnitedStates.Our contemporary world has been decisivelytransformed since 11 September 2001. The fightagainst international terrorism is high on our agenda.Hungary is strongly committed to the effective effortsof the community of nations to counter this threat.Towards that goal  we have consistently acted incooperation with our allies and the rest of theinternational community.In that respect  Hungary supports the ongoingglobal endeavours of the United Nations aimed againstterrorism. We find it crucial that Member States makeevery necessary and possible move to prevent furtherterrorist acts and implement national measures underrelevant Security Council resolutions to combat thatphenomenon. Effective cooperation among States isalso indispensable to act resolutely against the menaceof terrorism.Besides being a reliable partner in the globalcoalition  Hungary has taken the necessary domesticlegislative and executive measures to implement thedecisions of the international community. TheParliament of Hungary this week took the decision toratify the International Convention for the Suppressionof the Financing of Terrorism. By this legislative act Hungary has become a party to all of the internationalinstruments adopted by the United Nations againstterrorism. We continue to attach particular importanceto the unimpeded work of the Counter-TerrorismCommittee of the Security Council  with which wemaintain a particularly close relationship.In the context of the global coalition againstterrorism  Hungary is following developments inAfghanistan with keen interest. We welcome theconsolidation achieved so far by the Government ofAfghanistan with the assistance of the internationalcommunity. We wish to place on record our deep15appreciation for the excellent work done by theinternational forces. in that country. Further efforts tocontain and eliminate terrorist groups in Afghanistanwill remain a top priority. Hungary is committed tomaintaining its support to the Government ofAfghanistan as well as to its people.Iraqi non-compliance with Security Councilresolutions is a serious concern for all of us. Hungaryregrets that the Iraqi regime refuses to cooperate withthe United Nations and continues to pose a threat topeace and security in the region and the world at large.The international community cannot disregard this factand has to respond to it in a resolute manner. We willwork closely with our allies and partners to pursue thefull implementation of the relevant Security Councilresolutions  and we will do our share in the efforts tobuild a broad coalition of nations in order to preventthe Iraqi regime from producing and using weapons ofmass destruction.Having entered the twenty-first century  mankindcontinues to face further major global challenges  suchas illicit drug trafficking  money-laundering  corruptionand transnational organized crime. The role of theUnited Nations in facing and tackling these phenomenais of paramount importance. By the same token  globalrisks are widened by new types of security threats. Inour view  serious problems of regional stability  of low-intensity armed conflicts and threats of natural andman-made catastrophes are increasingly on the rise.Illegal transfers of nuclear  biological and chemicalmaterials pose grave threats. Illegal migration andillicit trafficking in human beings are also rightlyviewed as new forms of security risks. Hungary is morethan prepared to play its role  with all the means at ourdisposal  to meet these new challenges throughconcerted international efforts  including regionalarrangements.The year 2002 marked the beginning of a newreview cycle of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation ofNuclear Weapons. We expect the annual sessions of thePreparatory Committee leading up to the 2005 ReviewConference to make a significant contribution to thefurther strengthening of all aspects of this legalinstrument by ensuring its full implementation andpromoting its universality.The early start of negotiations on a fissilematerial cut-off treaty stands out as the next logicalstep aimed at curbing the proliferation of nuclearweapons. We cannot but regret that disagreements overthe comprehensive programme of work are preventingthe Conference on Disarmament from startingsubstantive work on this issue.One of the most important new threats tointernational peace and stability in the changed securityenvironment at the beginning of the twenty-firstcentury is caused by the proliferation of ballisticmissiles capable of delivering weapons of massdestruction. Hungary is ready to join internationalefforts to counter this danger  including new politicaland diplomatic initiatives. The system of multilaterallegal norms relating to non-proliferation  disarmamentand arms control fails to include regulations onresponsible international behaviour concerning ballisticmissiles. Out of the several propositions emergedrecently  Hungary lends its utmost support to thenegotiations on an international code of conductagainst the proliferation of ballistic missiles. Weappreciate the vigorous efforts of the States membersof the European Union to move this process forwardand hope for its successful completion in the nearfuture.Developments over the past 12 months haveraised more critically than ever the question of how toaddress in an efficient way the challenges posed by thedeliberate spread of disease  such as the anthraxincidents. The reinforcement of national public healthand civilian defence capabilities is crucial  even thoughthere are only a few countries that  acting alone  canput meaningful assets in place. Internationalcooperation in this respect must not be a distantopportunity; it is in the interest of each and everycountry  and of all nations as a whole.Complementary preventive efforts would beneeded as well to at least diminish the likelihood ofsuch an occurrence. Among such preventive efforts  thebenchmarking of arms control compliance willeventually have to find its legitimate place. That is whywe deem important the successful conclusion of theFifth Review Conference of States Parties to theBiological Weapons Convention  to be resumed inNovember this year under Hungarian chairmanship.Hungary remains strongly committed to theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and itsverification regime. In this regard  we concur with theview that nuclear disarmament and non-proliferationwill also be essential to combat international terrorism.16Hungary has  from the very beginning  given itsstrong support to the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court (ICC). The ICC has become the firstmajor multilateral legal institution of the twenty-firstcentury. We were proud to become a State party to theStatute of the ICC and to be among those whoseratification helped bring about the entry into force ofthe Statute this year. We firmly concur with the viewthat international law will be strengthened through thisnew legal institution.As a sign of our deep commitment to the RomeStatute  my Government has decided to nominate acandidate to the panel of judges of the ICC. I amconfident that the election of a Hungarian judge wouldcontribute to the genuine realization of the objectivesset out in the Rome Statute.Human rights are universal values. StatesMembers of the United Nations are expected to observethe norms and standards of human rights andfundamental freedoms  including minority rights adopted by the United Nations. By the same token  itwill remain the moral and political responsibility ofStates to call upon others to act in accordance withtheir voluntarily undertaken obligations. Hungary willnot hesitate to raise its voice when human rights areviolated in any part of the world. Internationalprotection of minority rights remains a majorpreoccupation for us. We continue to pursue our effortsaimed at a functioning universal legal system for theprotection of minorities.Globalization and interdependence are two majorphenomena shaping the contemporary world  includingthe political landscape of the United Nations.By taking advantage of the opportunitiesstemming from these phenomena  all of us could seek amuch better life for the inhabitants of our globe. TheUnited Nations has the necessary instruments at hand.A better and more responsible use of these instrumentscan contribute to the implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration Development Goals  aimed at creating amore prosperous and sustainable world for generationsto come.If we have the necessary political will anddetermination  we can have a United Nations thatworks relentlessly to improve the lives of all. That is in the final analysis  what the United Nations wasfounded for."

We look forward to extending a similarwelcome to East Timor when it joins our Organizationin the days ahead.In November 2001  from this same podium  Iasserted that in order to wage an effective struggleagainst the multiple threats and challenges confrontinghumankind  we must imbue ourselves with thedemocratic spirit. Without that spirit  we can only fail.In the relations and interactions among nations the democratic spirit is put into practice throughmultilateralism. Multilateralism exists when a group ofnations adopts a set of goals and each individualmember is equally responsible for the achievement ofthose goals. It entails respect for one another'ssensitivities and points of view  and therefore requiresdiscussion and the forging of consensus. For the value7of each nation  no matter how small or how poor  isequal to that of any other.To my mind  the ultimate form of multilateralismis a United Nations with a General Assembly alreadyrevitalized  a Security Council that is trulyrepresentative of the United Nations membership  and astreamlined Secretariat that is responsive to the needsand interests of all Member States.Nowhere is the necessity for multilateralism moreglaring than in our response to the scourge of our time:international terrorism. And nowhere else is the role ofthe United Nations more vital.The 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in thiscity and in Washington were not only an attack againstthe United States but also an attack against civilizationand all human values. Therefore  the coalition thatresponded to these attacks had to represent all ofhumanity — all nations  religions and cultures.For those reasons the United Nations was activelyinvolved in the response to the attacks and mustmaintain a pivotal role in the response of the worldcommunity to the persistent threat of internationalterrorism; otherwise  in the long run  that endeavourwill fail.The same is true of our efforts to advance thedisarmament agenda  which is also imperative. Untilthe States concerned rid themselves of their arsenals ofmass destruction — whether nuclear  biological orchemical — the danger remains that much  if not all ofthe human race  could be wiped out in a singleholocaust.In accordance with the multilateral principle ofequality  States should no longer cling to the privilegesderived from military superiority over others.Multilateral affirmative action can also bringabout peace  where for many years there has only beenviolence and bloodshed. In the Middle East  the Powersthat wield great influence on the region are called uponto adopt a just and balanced approach to the issue ofPalestine. They can  if they wish  persuade Israel towithdraw its forces from the occupied territories and tocease settlement activities in accordance with therelevant Security Council resolutions.That will help pave the way for the realization oftwo States  Palestine and Israel  living side by sidewithin secure internationally recognized borders. Onlythen will peace have a real chance.In this context we note with interest thecommuniqué issued yesterday by the Quartet on theMiddle East outlining a roadmap to realize such avision.Elsewhere  it is important to recall that thesituation in Iraq has been an issue that has occupied theSecurity Council for some time. Hence  while over thepast weeks we have witnessed an intensification of theinternational focus on this issue  we must not lose sightof the fact that mechanisms already exist within theUnited Nations system to address the issue. In tacklingthe present challenge  Indonesia deems it necessarythat peaceful efforts be fully exhausted and existingUnited Nations mechanisms be fully utilized  and  ifneed be  strengthened.Any unilateral use of force risks not onlyundermining the authority of the United Nations  butwould also carry the grave potential of destabilizing theimmediate region  and indeed beyond  with itsattendant humanitarian implications.For its part  Iraq must fully comply with therelevant Security Council resolutions. We areencouraged by the recent decision by the Governmentof Iraq to allow the return of United Nations inspectors.We trust that this will pave the way to a peacefulsolution of the problem and preclude any attack againstthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.The situation in Iraq cannot be viewed inisolation. How we address this problem will haverepercussions on the longer-standing issue of Palestineand the challenge of terrorism.In Afghanistan  the United Nations has donecommendable work in helping the Afghan partiesmanage the post-Taliban transition. The internationalcommunity must now help the Afghan people innation-building  rehabilitating the country'sinfrastructure and strengthening its newbornGovernment.In the long run  the war against terrorism can onlybe won if we emerge victorious in a more basicstruggle — the one against poverty. The substantialeradication of poverty  in fact  is what the developmentgoals of the Millennium Declaration all boil down to.As reported by the Secretary-General  the world8community has made some progress in this endeavour with East Asia recording the most significant gains.We still have a long way to go  however  beforewe can meet the goal of reducing by one half  between1990 and 2015  the number of people living on lessthan a dollar a day.If the Millennium goals will be met at all  a majorfactor will be the achievement of an international traderegime where unilateral practices and protectionismhave given way to genuine multilateralism. Hence  wetrust that the forthcoming negotiations mandated by theFourth World Trade Organization (WTO) MinisterialConference at Doha last year will make possible thefull integration of developing countries into themultilateral trading system. Much also depends onwhether the pledges made in Monterrey at theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment could be fulfilled and then exceeded.Earlier this month  the World Summit onSustainable Development reached agreement on aglobal programme to reduce poverty and restore theintegrity of our planet and formulated a blueprint forswitching to a more efficient use of carbon fuels andrenewable sources of energy. Despite the lack of atimetable  the fact remains that we have an action-oriented plan of implementation to be carried out by aglobal partnership of governments  private businessand civil society.A factor that can work against our hopes is aunilateralist trend so apparent at the global level. In theface of that trend  it becomes even more necessary anddesirable that regional organizations grow in strengthand share some of the burden that is now borne by theUnited Nations. This role was envisioned for themeven when the world organization was still beingestablished more than fifty-seven years ago.In general  regional organizations strictly adhereto a multilateral regime  and at that level many globalproblems are so much more manageable. It maytherefore be highly advisable to find ways and meansof further promoting the natural synergy between theUnited Nations and regional organizations. A goodexample is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN)  of which Indonesia is a founding member.For many years now  we in ASEAN have been workingwith United Nations bodies to the considerable benefitof our peoples. It is in this spirit that we  the ASEANcountries  are sponsoring a resolution in the GeneralAssembly on strengthening the working relationshipbetween our regional organization and the UnitedNations system.Long before the 11 September attacks  a regionalprogramme to combat terrorism and other transnationalcrimes was an integral part of our ASEAN functionalcooperation. In the face of the surge of this globalthreat  ASEAN has set in motion a work plan toimplement the 2001 ASEAN Declaration on Terrorismand Transnational Crime. We believe  however  that it is the totality ofASEAN's work that will decisively overcome not onlyterrorism but also the basic problem of poverty in ourregion. Since it was founded in 1967  ASEAN hastirelessly promoted political  economic and socialdevelopment cooperation among its members. Theresult has been three decades of relative peace andunprecedented economic growth  interrupted only bythe Asian financial crisis of 1997. To forestall therecurrence of such a devastating crisis  we have takenbold steps toward regional integration. Through thisapproach  we hope to achieve our vision of an ASEANthat is at peace within itself and with others  anASEAN that is technologically competitive with therest of the world and  through sustainable development has reached  for our part of the world  the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.From the time of its inception  ASEAN has beenmuch criticized for its preoccupation with consultationsand consensus-building  which seem to delay actionwhen swift action is needed. I am not troubled by thiscriticism because I regard it as an affirmation ofASEAN's adherence to the multilateral ethos.Multilateralism gives ASEAN coherence  commitmentand perseverance in the pursuit of its goals. That iswhy it has been an effective catalyst for the promotionof security and economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.At the national level  Indonesia has been similarlydoubted: it is said that reform legislation has beenlagging because of dithering and interminable debate.Moreover  in some international circles  Indonesia hasbeen portrayed as less than fully enthusiastic in theglobal fight against terror on the basis of a mistakenperception that it is lenient with radical Muslim groups.And yet  after all the necessary debates  we didtake large strides toward further democratization. Ourparliament recently endorsed several amendments to9our Constitution: the adoption of a system of directpopular election of the President and Vice-President the adoption of a bicameral system of legislature  andthe abolition by 2004 of the 38 seats reserved for themilitary and police in the legislature.A proposal for the adoption of the Shariah orMuslim law in our legal system did not obtain support.The proponents graciously and democratically acceptedthis reality and bowed to the decision of the people'srepresentatives and to the force of public opinion. Thisreflects our common commitment to democracy.We will adhere to the democratic process even inaddressing serious threats to our national security  suchas the separatist movements in the provinces of Acehand Papua and the disruptive communal strife in theprovinces of Maluku. On Aceh  we are prepared toresume negotiations with the Free Aceh Movement provided the Movement drop its separatist demand cease resorting to terrorist tactics and accept the law onspecial autonomy as a final political solution to theproblem. At the same time  we shall continue toprovide protection to civilians from terrorist attacksthat disrupt public order and cause much suffering.We have also applied special autonomy to theprovince of Papua  which guarantees protection of thecultural rights of the people  a just and equitable shareof the resources for development  and redress oflegitimate grievances. In the provinces of Maluku andNorth Maluku  communal strife has greatly abated withthe signing of two peace agreements between thefactions and the holding of reconciliation dialogues.The main task now is to build goodwill among thecommunities and help thousands of internally displacedpersons return home and start a new life.In many of our endeavours at political  economicand social reform  we have been supported by UnitedNations organizations  funds and programmes. We aretherefore deeply grateful to the Secretary-General forhis intention to enhance United Nations efforts to assistIndonesia in promoting good governance and inestablishing a stable  democratic and prosperoussociety.Thus at the national level  we have committedourselves to the processes of dialogue  wideparticipation and accountability  which are all inherentin a democracy  just as we stand for multilateralism ininternational affairs. We are committed to promote andprotect the individual rights of our citizens  just as wehave always advocated that every nation  no matterhow small or powerless  must have a voice ininternational affairs.At the same time  however  we affirm thatdemocracy is not merely the breaking of chains and theenjoyment of rights. Whoever would truly be free mustbind himself to the duties and obligations that matchand give meaning to his rights. Every individual hasresponsibilities to the community that nurtures him just as every nation has responsibilities to thecommunity of humankind  including the responsibilityto respect the views of all other members of thatcommunity. This is the fundamental meaning ofmultilateralism.In the ultimate analysis  this is all we need toaddress the challenges of our time and make a morepeaceful  more just and more prosperous world: that weall be sincerely responsible to one another  for oneanother and for the planet that is our only home in thislife."
"78",3211,"IND",57,2002,"﻿Icongratulate Mr. Kavan on his election as President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I alsoextend my best wishes to Secretary-General KofiAnnan in this first year of his second term in office.Two days ago  we commemorated the firstanniversary of a terrible event that focused thecollective global consciousness on internationalterrorism. Terrorism did not start on 11 September. Itwas on that day that it brazenly announced itself on theglobal stage  flaunting its immunity from distance andpower.15As a country exposed to the depredations ofterrorism for decades  India empathized with the painof the American people  admired their resilience incoming to terms with the consequences and supportedthe bold decision to counter-attack terrorism at its verysource.The international community has taken somecollective decisions in the global effort to combatterrorism and to choke off its lifelines. SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) contains the essence ofthese decisions. The Council's Counter-TerrorismCommittee should now move beyond informationcompilation and legal assistance to enforcingcompliance by States known to be sponsoring sheltering  funding  arming and training terrorists.In our South Asian region  nuclear blackmail hasemerged over the past few months as a new arrow inthe quiver of State-sponsored terrorism. Dark threatswere held out that actions by India to stamp out cross-border terrorism could provoke a nuclear war. Tosuccumb to such blatant nuclear terrorism would meanforgetting the bitter lessons of the 11 Septembertragedy.As far as India is concerned  we have repeatedlyclarified that no one in our country wants a war conventional or otherwise. Nor are we seeking anyterritory. But absolutely everyone in India wants an endto the cross-border terrorism which has claimedthousands of innocent lives and denied entiregenerations their right to a peaceful existence withnormal economic and social activity. We aredetermined to end it with all the means at ourcommand. Let there be no doubt about that in anyquarter.Yesterday we heard the extraordinary claim inthis Assembly that the brutal murder of innocentcivilians in Jammu and Kashmir is actually a freedomstruggle and that the forthcoming elections in that stateare a farce  since they cannot be a substitute for aplebiscite demanded over 50 years ago. It requires aneffort of acrobatic logic to believe that the carnageamong innocents is an instrument for freedom and thatelections are a symbol of deception and repression. Ifthe elections are a mere fraud  why are terrorists beingtrained and infiltrating India at the command of theInter-Services Intelligence Agency of Pakistan to killelection candidates and to intimidate voters?If Pakistan claims to be a crucial partner in theinternational coalition against terrorism  how can itcontinue to use terrorism as an instrument of Statepolicy against India?How can the international coalition condonePakistan-directed killings of thousands of innocentcivilians  women and children included  topromote a bizarre version of self-determination? Thosewho speak of underlying or root causes of terrorismoffer alibis to the terrorists and absolve them ofresponsibility for their heinous actions  such as the 11September attacks on the United States or the 13December attack on our Parliament.Yesterday we heard yet another patently false andself-serving claim that in India Muslims and otherminorities are the target of Hindu extremists. With 150million Muslims  India has the second largest Muslimpopulation in the world; greater than that of Pakistan.We are proud of the multi-religious character of oursociety. Equal respect for all faiths and non-discrimination on the basis of religion are not just partof our Constitutional obligations  but  as the wholeworld knows  they are the signature theme of India'scivilization and culture.We have to recognize that the developmentaldivide between the North and the South is becomingwider and deeper by the day. The challenges that faceus are stark  and there is no alternative to having allcountries of the world join hands to face them together.Over the last decade  10 million people have beenjoining the ranks of the poor each year. A quarter of theworld's population lives in extreme poverty.We have to find US$ 24 billion annually forinvestment in poor countries  if we are to achieve theWorld Food Summit goal of halving hunger by 2015.The continuation of widespread poverty  at a timewhen unimaginable wealth is concentrated in a smallsocial layer  is totally unacceptable. The twenty-firstcentury has all the means to end this sad legacy of thepast centuries. What is lacking is the political willamong the developed countries to sincerely andspeedily address the legitimate developmental needs ofthe developing countries  especially the least developedones.16Casting an even longer shadow over this grimdevelopmental canvas is global climate change  fromwhich the poor will most suffer  though theycontributed least to it. The recent floods and forest firesin Europe are a forewarning that the countries of Asiaand Africa are not the only victims of the fury of adegraded environment. The Earth's atmosphere andbiosphere know no national boundaries. The choicebefore the global community is stark: Either we takeurgent steps to protect the environment or be preparedfor far worse natural calamities.Early this month  the Johannesburg Summit forSustainable Development debated some of the linkagesbetween poverty  trade  environment  national international and corporate governance and globalfinancial flows. We emerged from the Summit withsome encouraging outcomes  but these fell well shortof the demands of our time.It has become a categorical imperative tounderstand and address man's developmental needs intheir totality  and not in isolated parts. It isdisconcerting that the highways of development arejammed with the noisy and unruly traffic ofmaterialism and its brash cousin  consumerism. Humanvalues have become mute bystanders in most political economic and social activities.The result of this imbalance between our materialand non-material needs can never be happy formankind. On the contrary  if we are guided bycompassion  care  feeling for our fellow human beings cooperation and other human values  we are bound toget the right solutions to every problem on our planet.Humanity is crying out for a harmoniousintegration of the economic  social  political environmental and spiritual dimensions ofdevelopment. This task calls for the closest possiblecooperation among nations and communities  with areadiness to accept the best from every cultural andspiritual tradition around the globe. The United Nationsneeds to take up newer and bigger initiatives in thisdirection.In this Assembly  less than a year ago  and in theUnited States Congress the year before  I had extendedIndia's offer to coordinate a comprehensive globaldevelopment dialogue. I reiterate that offer today. If weare to achieve the development goals we have promisedourselves by 2015  we need such a dialogue urgently.As we come together once again at the UnitedNations  at a time of new and diverse challenges  weshould reflect on our collective commitment to theCharter  its purposes and principles. There is a growingperception  particularly among the weaker and poorercountries  that responses to issues of far-reachingimpact often seem arbitrary and contradictory.A common destiny is at stake. The world needscollective multilateralism. It needs the United Nations the coming together and working together of all itsnations in the development of a common and collectiveperspective.Conflicts arise when there is no spirit ofdemocracy within and among nations. A genuinelydemocratic framework enables us to respect alternativepoints of view  to value diversity and to fashionsolutions responsive to the aspirations of people.India's own experience as a hugely populated anddiverse nation shows how complex problems can beaddressed within a constitutional and democraticframework.These values need to be assiduously nurtured inour societies  so that at least a future generation is ridof the scourge of poverty  intolerance  obscurantismand religious extremism.Democratic societies are far less prone toideologies based on violence or militarist yearnings since they do not have their fingers permanently on thetrigger of a gun. We have to be vigilant against threatsto democracy worldwide arising from forces that areopposed to it  be they rooted in fundamentalist politicalideologies or extremist religious dogmas.All of us are aware of the challenges. Most of usare agreed that a stable global order has to rest on thefour strong pillars of peace  security  sustainabledevelopment and democracy. We have to ensure thateach of these pillars is strong and resilient.We are conscious of our collective responsibility.It is the leap from this theoretical understanding to itspractical realization that we have often failed toexecute. We should not fail again. Our futuregenerations will not forgive us if we do."
"79",3257,"IRL",57,2002,"﻿I congratulate the Mr. JanKavan on his election as President of the fifty-seventhsession of the General Assembly. I look forward toworking closely with him as the Czech Republic  agood friend of my country  moves ever closer tomembership in the European Union. Our thanks are dueto Mr. Han Seung-soo for his work as President of thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I amdelighted to welcome Switzerland as a new Member ofthe Organization and look forward to the imminentmembership of East Timor  a nation whose birth wasfostered by this Organization.Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark hasalready addressed the General Assembly on behalf ofthe European Union. Ireland associates itself fully withhis remarks.We are all still haunted  a year later  by theshadow of the terrible deaths and events of 11September 2001. Last year in the delayed generaldebate  I spoke about the implications of thoseatrocities. I set out my thoughts on how we as theinternational community should respond. Myconclusions last year and my message today are thesame.The United Nations is at the centre of our systemof collective security. It is a mirror of ourdetermination and our political will. This is the worldbody invested by the peoples of the world with uniquelegitimacy and unique authority. Around the worldpeople look in hope and idealism to the UnitedNations. We must be worthy of that trust.I want to fully endorse the Secretary-General'saddress to the Assembly yesterday. As the Secretary-General said  All States have a clear interest  as wellas a clear responsibility  to uphold international lawand maintain international order' (see A/57/PV.2).States must honour their international obligations.Unless we consistently call to account those who defyor flagrantly violate their obligations  our system willbe discredited.The choice we face is stark. Either we stand byand strengthen the international system and the rule oflaw  or we invite anarchy. The great Irish poet W. B.Yeats put it graphically in The Second Coming':Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world'.That was what the perpetrators of 11 Septemberwanted. Their vicious attack was not just on theinnocent people  of many nationalities  including myown  in New York  Washington and Pennsylvania;not just on the United States; but on the very values wecherish and that are the foundation on which thisOrganization is built. They will have succeeded if weare provoked into abandoning those values and laws.Ultimately they can be defeated  and the scourge ofinternational terror ended  only if we stand united indefence of our international obligations and the rule oflaw.Within our system  the Security Council ischarged with responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. When there are threatsto international peace and security  the Member Statesconcerned are obliged to bring these matters to theattention of the Security Council. When the SecurityCouncil acts in such cases  all Member States areobliged to implement its resolutions. Regrettably  theysometimes fail to do so.Any law that is flagrantly violated becomesweakened over time. That is why flagrant violation anddefiance of Security Council resolutions should be amatter of the utmost concern to all Member States.The terrorist attacks of 11 September required anurgent response from the international community. Itwas vital that the Security Council was at the centre ofthe international community's response. The Council to quote the Secretary-General  responded withpatience  creativity and determination'.The Security Council adopted resolution 1368(2001)  demanding the fullest possible cooperation ofthe international community in bringing theperpetrators to justice. It subsequently authorized thedeployment of an international security force toAfghanistan. It put in place measures to counterinternational terrorism.30The establishment by the Security Council of theCounter-Terrorism Committee to oversee theimplementation of resolution 1373 (2001) was alandmark development. Its work has been instrumentalin making it more difficult for international terroristnetworks to organize and finance their activities.Continued persistence and vigilance are required.We still have much more to do. We must make itimpossible for the agents of international terror tooperate. We must persevere with initiatives such as thefreezing of assets and the denial of safe haven. At thesame time  we must ensure that everything we dorespects the United Nations Charter and the body ofinternational human rights law we have sopainstakingly constructed. That is our best guaranteeagainst evil and its perpetrators.In his address to the General Assembly yesterday the Secretary-General also correctly identified fourserious current threats to world peace.First  on the Middle East  there can be no doubtthat there is a need for greater urgency in the efforts tobring an end to the conflict. The vision of SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 1397(2002) must be implemented.For far too long the Palestinian people have beendenied their legitimate rights. Today they exist in astate of deep impoverishment. Ireland strongly believesthat in order to reach a settlement that will give theIsraeli people the security they deserve and that willgive the Palestinian people their legitimate rights andsovereignty  the parties must move forward. They mustin particular address not just the security issues butalso the economic and humanitarian needs ofPalestinians  and they must establish a concrete targetfor a political settlement.For its part  the European Union  working closelywith the United Nations  the United States and Russiathrough the quartet'  will continue to encourage andassist the parties to end the conflict and move towardsa permanent peace.This conflict has been an ongoing source ofsuffering for the peoples of the region and also a focalpoint of instability for the rest of the world. It remainsa threat of the utmost gravity to international peace andsecurity. We can and must give it the highest priority.Secondly  the Secretary-General mentioned Iraq.Iraq has been in violation of Security Councilresolutions  in particular on arms inspection  for someconsiderable time. Secretary-General Kofi Annan hasbeen engaged in serious efforts to encourage Iraq tocomply with its obligations under those SecurityCouncil resolutions. We will continue to stronglysupport his good offices.Let us express wholehearted agreement with thecall by the Secretary-General for Iraq to comply withits obligations for the sake of its own people and forthe sake of world order. If Iraq's defiance continues the Security Council must face its responsibilities.We call on Iraq to respect its obligations and toimplement in full and without preconditions all theSecurity Council resolutions addressed to it. Theweapons inspectors must be allowed in to do the workauthorized by the Council. Iraq's leadership has itwithin its own power to end the current predicamentand to alleviate the great hardship on its people. Itshould do so without delay.Thirdly  it is essential for the internationalcommunity to maintain its strong and active support forthe people and the Government of Afghanistan.Afghanistan has come through great trials over the pastyear. We should not overlook the fact that  despite thebest efforts of the international coalition to ensure thatthe use of force was targeted and proportionate  manyinnocent Afghans have died. We should rememberthem  too  in our thoughts and prayers. Ultimately  theyare just as much victims of the terrorist groups whocarried out the attacks of 11 September as those whowere murdered in New York  Washington andPennsylvania.Considerable progress has been achieved inAfghanistan with the help of the internationalcommunity. There are clear signs that  overall  thequality of life is improving. Nonetheless  there is still along way to go if Afghanistan is completely to escapethe violence and instability of the past.The humanitarian situation in Afghanistanremains acute. The sustained and wholehearted supportof the international community remains essential therefore  if progress is to be maintained.For its part  Ireland has been active in theSecurity Council  particularly in highlighting thehumanitarian situation. We have pledged $12 millionover the next three years  the majority of which has31already been dispensed. We are also contributingpersonnel to the international stabilization force.Fourthly  as regards India and Pakistan  wewelcome the decrease in tension between these twocountries. The risk of open conflict between twonuclear-capable countries is a matter of the utmostconcern to all of us. We encourage the leaders of Indiaand Pakistan to address the underlying causes that giverise to the potential for conflict.The proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  chemical  biological and nuclear  is of course  an issue that goes far beyond Iraq. Theyrepresent a major threat to international peace andsecurity. The international instruments and regimes tocontrol the spread  and bring about the elimination  ofsuch weapons must be strengthened and fullyimplemented. Ultimately  the long-term control andelimination of weapons of mass destruction can beachieved only through a comprehensive and rigoroussystem of international treaties and obligations that areverifiable and universal.Ireland  together with our New Agenda partners will continue its efforts in this regard during this year'ssession of the General Assembly. We call on all Statesthat are concerned about these issues to become moreconstructively engaged in the period ahead.All of us recognize that conflict prevention  notjust conflict resolution  is the central challenge facingthe United Nations. Poverty  inequality and injusticeare all too often the breeding ground for instability andfor threats to peace. They are an affront to theinternational conscience. We must tackle the injusticesthat all too often allow conflict situations to develop.Our challenge is to show that there is a peacefuland legitimate way of dealing with these problems. It isonly through the development of integrated strategiesthat address the underlying causes of conflict poverty  injustice and the abuse of fundamental rightsand freedoms  that the international community canbring about long-term peace and stability.The Millennium Summit Declaration confirmedthe commitment of the world's leadership to tacklingthe root causes of conflict. The Secretary-General hassince called for the United Nations to move from aculture of reaction to a culture of prevention. Irelandfully supports the implementation of the Secretary-General's report on conflict prevention (A/55/985).The United Nations must be equipped with thenecessary tools to develop coherent conflict-preventionpolicies. Let us commit ourselves to supporting theSecretary-General in his ongoing reform initiatives. Wemust revitalize the General Assembly so that it canplay its proper role. Let us re-engage on reform of theSecurity Council so that it reflects modern geopoliticalrealities. We need a Security Council which is asrepresentative as possible of the internationalcommunity  while being in a position to functionefficiently  and we must provide the United Nationswith sufficient resources to meet its responsibilities.Sustainable development focused on povertyeradication is the most powerful instrument which theinternational community has to address the long-termroot causes of conflict and to promote peace. Let usalso remind ourselves of the international community'slong-standing commitment to meeting the UnitedNations target of spending 0.7 per cent of grossnational product on overseas development assistance.At the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg  my Prime Minister  TaoiseachBertie Ahern  confirmed Ireland's commitment to meetthat target by 2007.Let us restate our commitment to providinguniversal access to basic health care. We must berelentless in the campaign to eliminate diseases such asHIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis. The spread ofthose diseases threatens to undermine our developmentprogrammes. We must step up our efforts to eradicatethem. We must aim for the targets set out in theDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS  adopted bythe General Assembly in June 2001. We must ensurethat the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosisand Malaria is adequately resourced.The Johannesburg Summit agreed upon a globalcomprehensive action plan for sustainable developmentwhich will help guide our policies and programmes inthe coming years. The Summit Declaration'scommitment on sustainable development has thepotential to make an important contribution to conflictprevention  particularly in Africa.Effective conflict prevention is also about puttingnecessary structures in place. The Brahimi report onUnited Nations peace operations (A/55/305)acknowledged the pressing need to establish both long-term and short-term conflict prevention strategies. Iwould like to reiterate Ireland's support for the32Secretary-General's initiatives and for the role thatUnited Nations peacekeeping has to play in anintegrated conflict prevention strategy.Peacekeeping is at the heart of Ireland'scontribution to the United Nations. We are immenselyproud of the contribution which Irish personnel havemade to United Nations peacekeeping. We reserve aspecial place in our hearts for those who have giventheir lives in the service of the United Nations. Thiswas demonstrated once again in a moving ceremonywhich was held to mark the standing down of the Irishbattalion from the United Nations Interim Force inLebanon after 24 years of service.As a member of the European Union  Irelandwelcomes the deepening cooperation between theEuropean Union and the United Nations on conflictprevention and peacekeeping. This will be givenfurther concrete expression when the European Uniontakes over the United Nations police operation inBosnia and Herzegovina next January.Respect for human rights is a core dimension inconflict prevention. This is the very foundation onwhich peace and security surely depend. Human rightsmust be integrated into all United Nations activities.The entry into force of the Rome Statute establishingthe International Criminal Court sends a clear signal ofdetermination to bring to justice those who perpetrategenocide  crimes against humanity and war crimes. Iwould urge those who have not ratified the RomeStatute to do so. The international community is at itsstrongest when it stands unified  bound together by thestrength of the rule of law.I would like to take the opportunity presented bythis address to the General Assembly to pay tribute toMary Robinson  former President of Ireland  who hasjust completed her term as United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. We are deeply proudof her achievements. We know that she will continue tobe a fearless champion of the universality of humanrights.Turning to the situation in Northern Ireland  wehave seen substantial progress across the key areas ofimplementation of the Good Friday Agreement since Ilast addressed this Assembly. The political institutionsof the Agreement are operating on a positive andinclusive basis  bringing tangible benefits across theboard. An independent international commission hasoverseen two acts of arms decommissioning by theIrish Republican Army. The Patten Commissionreport's vision of a new beginning for policing inNorthern Ireland is being progressively realized. I callon all to fully play their part in laying a foundation forand strengthening the new policing arrangements.Welcome progress has been made in normalizingsecurity arrangements on the ground. However  moreneeds to be done  and we need to see further earlyprogress  especially in the South Armagh area.The considerable record of achievement however  has not made us complacent about thedifficulties and challenges that remain. The level ofstreet violence in the interface areas of Belfast and thesectarian attacks on vulnerable households  forinstance  have given us all cause for serious concern.These have had a corrosive effect on communityconfidence. They need to be addressed urgently in alltheir dimensions  including through effective policingmeasures leading to convictions.The Irish and British Governments remainabsolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreementand to its implementation in full. Its core principles constitutional stability based on consent  partnershippolitics  inclusive political institutions and structuredNorth-South cooperation on the island of Ireland represent the only viable basis for a workable politicalaccommodation. In short  the Agreement  which hasbeen much praised and admired by States Members ofthe Assembly  continues to be the only template forpolitical progress in Northern Ireland.Before concluding  I would like to refer briefly toIreland's membership of the Security Council  whichcomes to an end on 31 December 2002. Ireland'sexperience as a member of the Council has stronglyreinforced our belief in the system of collective globalsecurity. The central role of the Security Council in theaftermath of 11 September 2001 underlined theimportance of its role as guardian of internationalpeace and security. It must now build on thatachievement. Ireland has  I believe  made a substantivecontribution to the work of the Council. We will seekto continue to do so in the remaining months of ourterm. Our mission in the United Nations is tocontinually strive for a world that is fair and just. Thiscan best be done through our system of collectivesecurity  through international economic and socialdevelopment and through respect for human rights andinternational law. If we can commit ourselves torespect the decisions of the Security Council and all33our other international obligations  then innocent livescan be saved and seemingly interminable conflictsresolved.We have the methods and the means to peaceablyresolve the dangers that threaten us. It should not bebeyond our talent and resources to achieve this. But todo so  we need to assert the core values ofmultilateralism in particular  and its capacity toachieve  for all our people  a better and safer world."
"80",3304,"IRN",57,2002,"﻿Iwould like at the outset to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavanon his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session and to assure himof the full support and cooperation of the delegation ofthe Islamic Republic of Iran as he embarks on hiscrucial task. I would also like to express myappreciation to the President of Assembly at its fifty-19sixth session for his skilful leadership. I would alsolike to welcome Switzerland to the United Nations  andlook forward also to welcoming the DemocraticRepublic of Timor-Leste.I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his strong and compassionate leadershipand for the vision and wisdom that he expressed in hisstatement before the Assembly.The world today is characterized by greatdiversity and emerging factors with a far-reachinginfluence. In the light of advances in informationtechnology and of the new international informationorder  current issues and problems are interrelated  likethe parts of an organism  and truly global. More thanever before  we see that nations and States are seekingto expand their options and ascertain the nature and theextent of their contribution to  and participation in global affairs on the basis of not only their nationalsecurity and interests but also their regionalresponsibilities  as well as international requirementsand norms. This trend towards the achievement of suchfundamental objectives points to the expansion of aglobal  democratic and participatory process that willendure in the long term and is thus sustainable.Embracing diversity  questioning and criticallyreviewing the past and seeking democraticparticipation and action all teach us that thefundamental universal human values of peace andsecurity  freedom and independence  and justice andfairness must become the very centre of globalattention. Without continued  active cooperation todraw our world closer to such fundamental values  wewill not successfully meet the current globalchallenges. Without expanding the scope of peace andsecurity  neither freedom nor independence will beachievable; without justice and fairness  neither peacenor security will become accessible; and withoutfreedom and independence  both peace and securitywill become impossible to attain. It is only throughsuch an approach that we will be able to work together think together and cooperate in a multilateralframework so as to find answers to challenges we facein common and to deal with regional crises.The world is facing grave challenges today particularly in the aftermath of the tragic terror attacksof 11 September 2001. Chief among these challengesare terrorism and other forms of violence. Combatingthe sinister phenomenon of terrorism is an urgent andunavoidable imperative. A genuine and effective fightagainst terrorism must include  on the one hand  anattempt to identify the root causes of terrorism and  onthe other  a concerted effort by the internationalcommunity to address them. It goes without saying thatthe perpetrators of acts of terrorism must be brought tojustice and given their just deserts. Calling for the rootcauses of terrorism to be addressed should in no waybe construed as an attempt to justify terrorism ordetract from the gravity of terrorist acts or from theseverity of the punishments that terrorists deserve. It isintended to pinpoint an effective and comprehensivemeans of eliminating terrorism.In this context  it appears that exploring problemssuch as the worldwide increase in injustice anddiscrimination  the marginalization of a large numberof people and occupation and the violation of thesovereignty and territorial integrity of others extremism  fanaticism  bigotry  poverty andunderdevelopment could prove helpful in identifyingthe root causes of terrorism.In our opinion  a wise and principled approach tofighting terrorism would entail full internationalcooperation  expressed at the highest political level in aworld summit that would seek  inter alia  to develop aninclusive definition of terrorism that is generallyacceptable.In a letter addressed to the Secretary-Generalimmediately after the disastrous attacks of 11September  President Khatami called for such a worldsummit to address this crucial issue and to encourageinternational cooperation to fight terrorism under theauspices of the United Nations.There should be a worldwide campaign againstall forms and manifestations of terrorism and theirperpetrators  irrespective of the identity of the victimsor the objectives. Distinction must also be madebetween acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggle ofpeoples under foreign occupation or aggression  inaccordance with international law. Any campaign benton relating the inhuman phenomenon of terrorism todivine religions that have always been the harbingersof peace  love  amity and moral decency is a great andunforgivable transgression against those religions andtheir countless followers.As a victim of the most brutal acts of terrorism the Islamic Republic of Iran regards fighting terrorismin a genuine and comprehensive way as a top national20priority  and it is thus in the forefront of theinternational coalition against terrorism. To helppromote regional and international peace and security my country has thus far signed bilateral agreements oris in the process of finalizing such agreements withmore than 20 countries on the extradition of offendersand on the provision of legal assistance for promotingcooperation in the areas of fighting terrorism  drugtrafficking and other organized crimes  of theextradition of criminals and of mutual legal assistance.We are intent on further strengthening this policy ofenhanced cooperation. In that context  and inaccordance with Security Council resolutions 1373(2001) and 1390 (2002)  the Islamic Republic of Iranhas reported to the Security Council Counter-TerrorismCommittee regarding its counter-terrorism efforts ingeneral and about the measures it has adopted againstthe Taliban and Al Qaeda in particular.We are greatly concerned by the current trend ofinternational disarmament negotiations  which isleading to the further vulnerability and fragility ofinternational security. Rejection of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) by a permanentmember of the Security Council and the holder of thelargest nuclear arsenal  and the withdrawal of thatmember from negotiations on the CTBT on-siteinspection operational manual  point to that State'spolicy of unilateralism. Further signs of such a policyare its withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty  its blocking of the negotiations on a protocolstrengthening the implementation of the BiologicalWeapons Convention and its going against thejudgement of the international community with respectto the regulation of the trade and transfer of small armsand light weapons.It is only by developing a broader view ofmultilateralism  international cooperation and respectfor the rule of law that we can guarantee progress andsuccess in the field of disarmament and internationalsecurity issues. Expansion of and deeper respect forhuman rights throughout the world are a function oftheir universality and indivisibility  on the one hand and of the recognition of national and regionalparticularities and cultural backgrounds  on the other.Rejecting the use of human rights forpolitical purposes  rejecting double standards anddiscriminatory approaches  and promoting internationalcooperation in that field for the sake of human rightswill definitely help promote respect for human rightsand fundamental freedoms. Such an approach prevailedat the fifty-eighth session of the Commission onHuman Rights  and my country thus received afavourable decision. We are pleased that  with thecooperation of other States  our draft resolutions ondeveloping international cooperation in the field ofhuman rights and on promoting cultural diversity wereadopted.Globalization will yield fruitful results whenit is accompanied by a non-selective and non-discriminatory approach: when it provides equalopportunities for all within the framework of a globalpartnership. If the developed countries fail to fulfiltheir responsibilities  globalization can hardly be calleda success story. An open  equitable  law-based transparent and non-discriminatory internationaltrading system is a prerequisite for achieving the goalsof economic growth and sustainable development indeveloping countries.The continued brutalities in occupied Palestineonce again indicate that solutions not well grounded injustice and realism will fail to bring about lasting peacein the Middle East region. The Palestinian people havethe right  under international law  the Charter of theUnited Nations and the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights  to persist in their struggle to restoretheir inalienable rights. Occupying other people's landmust be condemned  as must labelling as terrorist anation that is only fighting to liberate its homeland.The way to achieve a lasting peace in the MiddleEast is to guarantee to Palestinians the right to return totheir homeland and the right to self-determination leading to the formation — in a democratic process andunder the supervision of the United Nations — of aPalestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.It is the Palestinian people's legitimate right to choose through democratic means  their future political systemand the manner in which they elect to establish theircivil and political order. We respect the choices that thePalestinian people make.The long-standing policy of the Islamic Republicof Iran towards Afghanistan has been the rejection ofviolence  the promotion of intra-Afghan dialogue andthe establishment of a representative Government bydemocratic means. We are pleased that  as a result ofinternational efforts — particularly by the UnitedNations — civil order is gradually being consolidatedby the Afghan people themselves through the21establishment of the Interim Administration  theEmergency Loya Jirga and the TransitionalGovernment. Formulating Afghanistan's Constitutionon the basis of democratic principles  Afghan cultureand tradition  taking into account the views of allethnic groups  will be a major step in consolidating lawand order  in strengthening the political structure and inachieving peace  security and stability in Afghanistan.The Islamic Republic of Iran is continuing itsclose cooperation with the Transitional Government ofAfghanistan  especially in the context of spending the$50 million in assistance earmarked for small-scalereconstruction projects in Afghanistan during theIranian fiscal year 1381  which began on 21 March2002. Joint efforts that are moving forward includeproviding custom facilities and preferentialarrangements in customs  transit  trade and scientific cultural and educational cooperation; combating drugtrafficking and terrorism; and helping Afghan refugeesto return to Afghanistan. The international communityis expected to make good on its pledges to Afghanistanso as to begin to rebuild the economic infrastructurethere and to create conditions conducive to thevoluntary return of Afghan refugees to their homeland.Greater attention and resources must be invested —particularly by the United Nations InternationalDrug Control Programme — in crop substitutionprogrammes in Afghanistan as an effective strategy tofight narcotics trafficking.Respect for the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of Iraq and compliance by Iraq with relevantSecurity Council resolutions — particularly thoseconcerning the return of the weapons inspectors toIraq — followed by the lifting of internationalsanctions in the interest of the oppressed people ofIraq  constitute the overall policy of the IslamicRepublic of Iran towards Iraq. We oppose anyunilateral measures or military intervention in Iraq  weunderline the central role of the United Nations in thatregard  and we hold that it is up to the people of Iraq todetermine their own future through democratic means.The Islamic Republic of Iran is following thesituation between its two neighbours  Pakistan andIndia  with much concern. As a neighbour  we wish tostress the age-old wisdom of the subcontinent and toimpress upon the leadership in both countries theimportance of exercising self-restraint in both wordand deed and of keeping open the lines ofcommunication and dialogue with a view to resolvingthe situation in accordance with the rules and principlesof international law and in the interests of both nations.The current global trend towards participation incollective efforts to face major international challengesand resolve regional crises through democratic meanshas raised a glimmer of hope for our world today. Nodoubt  dialogue among civilizations has a special placein charting the way and promoting understanding andtolerance in these troubled times. Dialogue  as amultifaceted and long-term process  teaches us to growout of the politics of domination that have created somuch agony and violence and gradually to opt for thepolitics of interaction  tolerance and communication. Inthis context  the United Nations  as a centre ofdialogue  international decision-making andimplementation  will increasingly gain in importance asthe international community resolves to strengtheninternational peace  security and development."
"81",3351,"IRQ",57,2002,"﻿Mr. President  I would like  atthe outset  to congratulate you on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly and would like toexpress my appreciation of the United NationsSecretary-General's eloquent statement at the openingof this session  which gave good support tomultilateralism and international relations and exposedthe dangers of unilateralism and hegemony.I also wish to congratulate the SwissConfederation on its membership and East Timor on itsprospective membership to the United Nations.This session is held one year after the tragicevents of 11 September 2001  and I would like torenew our condolences to the American people especially the families of the victims of this tragedy and express to them our deep sympathy.It gives me pleasure to express my sinceregratitude to the States of the international communityand to organizations for their substantive positionrejecting the United States Administration's threatsagainst Iraq and for the calls they made for acomprehensive political solution to the impasse in therelationship between Iraq and the Security Council.In response to several appeals made by the UnitedNations Secretary-General  peace-loving States andregional organizations  my Government decided toallow the return of United Nations weapons inspectorswithout conditions as a first step towards acomprehensive solution that includes the lifting ofsanctions imposed on Iraq and the timelyimplementation of other provisions of relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  including resolution 687 (1991).I was instructed by the President of the Republicof Iraq  His Excellency Mr. Saddam Hussein  to conveyto you  in the allotted time  excerpts of a letter he hasaddressed to the General Assembly  in which HisExcellency presents Iraq's position on the latestdevelopments in the relationship between Iraq and theSecurity Council.Following are excerpts from the letter:“In his speech at the General Assembly thatwas preceded and accompanied by noisypropaganda and extensive preparation  the UnitedStates President  instead of paying attention tocommon issues of concern to humanity at large has presented the security problems of his owncountry and the sacrifices it has suffered since theevents of September 11.“It is a good sign that the United Statesresorted  for the first time since the end of thecold war  to the General Assembly to put forwardone of its problems  after years of disregard of theweight  effect and opinion of others. Nevertheless the United States President revealed his basicpurpose when he jumped to the issue of Iraq withoutany introduction or acceptable progression. Heportrayed that issue as if it were the most dangeroussituation  not only for the life  security and future ofthe United States  but also for the life  future andsecurity of the whole world. Among hisgeneralizations  which included deliberateinsinuations  he presented extreme distortions ofthe so-called nuclear  biological and chemicalthreats  so as to make American citizens believethe deliberate insinuation that Iraq was linked tothe American people's tragedy of 11 September.“He seems to have assumed that the countriesof the world are unaware of the AmericanAdministration and its methods  or of Iraq and itshigh sense of responsibility toward humanity  itsdesire for peace and stability  or of the fact that theIraqis are a creative people in work  production and innovation  in addition to being the heirs ofthe most ancient human civilizations.“The United States President talked about theimportance of the application of democracy on thepart of the Government of Iraq. He pretended tocare for the people of Iraq after he and otherPresidents before him have killed Iraqis by usingweapons such as depleted uranium  and by theblockade  which is now more than twelve years old in which more than one million and seven hundredthousand innocent Iraqis  out of a population oftwenty five million citizens  have died.“So  after utilizing the Americanpropaganda machine for a long time and spoutingofficial statements full of lies  distortion  andfalsehood  the focus was basically turned on25inciting the American public against Iraq andpushing it to believe the United StatesAdministration's schemes of aggression as a faitaccompli  as if it were the solution or the necessaryrescue that would allow American citizens to livein security and stability  after what they had gonethrough in the 11 September events.“When the United States Administrationrealized that it was necessary to have aninternational cover for using force against Iraqand that the world did not believe the lies it triedto propagate to link Iraq to the September events it changed the issue and began to shed crocodiletears about international law and the necessity tocomply with the resolutions of internationallegitimacy  alleging that Iraq is not complyingwith Security Council resolutions  especially withregard to the United Nations inspectors. Thisimplied that Iraq had the intention to develop  orthat it already possesses  nuclear  chemical andbiological weapons. According to these allegations it might give such weapons to terrorist organizationsthat pose a threat to world security.“Now that Iraq has accepted the return ofthe United Nations inspectors  we will all be ableto see how they work. In our past experience withthese inspectors (1991-1998)  Iraq used to ask theinspection teams to do their job in accordancewith the declared goals of the Security Council.However  some of the inspectors went on doingintelligence and espionage work that had nothingto do with the official mandate of the inspectionteams. Some of those inspectors have publiclyadmitted this; some  including an American  arestill publicly talking about it. Even Mr. RolfEkeus  the former chief of the United NationsSpecial Commission (UNSCOM)  has recentlystated that the inspectors overstepped the limits oftheir defined duties by spying on the Iraqileadership. I quote: ‘The United States and otherPowers exploited the inspection teams for theirown political ends  including monitoringPresident Saddam Hussein's whereabouts.' Healso said that the inspection teams deliberatelycreated problems to prepare the ground forpossible military attacks.“Iraq has always defended the principlesand values that you have willingly set down inthe United Nations Charter and the purposes forwhich the Security Council was created  whichare to preserve security and to establish peace.Therefore  by confronting evil for twelve yearsnow  Iraq has not only been defending its ownpatriotism  but rather it has acted as if it weredefending your own patriotism. It has been actingon your behalf without being assigned to do so. Intargeting Iraq  the United States Administration isacting on behalf of Zionism  which has beenkilling the heroic people of Palestine  destroyingtheir property  murdering their children  andseeking to impose their domination on the wholeworld  not only militarily  but also economicallyand politically.“The United States Administration wants todestroy Iraq in order to control Middle East oil and consequently control the politics as well asthe oil and economic policies of the whole world.If it succeeds in that  God forbid  it would dictatefor each country what it needs for its economicdevelopment  what quantities of oil it is allowed tobuy  at what prices  along with other conditions.“Briefly  what Iraq wants is the respect ofthe principles of the United Nations Charter andinternational law  whether regarding its owninterests and sovereignty or those of the otherMember States of the United Nations. On thisbasis  Iraq was  and still is  ready to cooperatewith the Security Council and internationalorganizations. However  Iraq rejects anyone'stransgression of its rights  sovereignty  securityand independence. That would be in contradictionwith the principles of the Charter andinternational law.“Hence  Iraq has not rejected the relevantresolutions of the Security Council  even thoughthose that relate to Iraq are unjust and at oddswith the United Nations Charter and internationallaw. Iraq rather calls on members of the SecurityCouncil  and on the United States Administrationin particular  to respect their own obligationsunder the Charter  under international law and therelevant Security Council resolutions. Iraqdemands that its inalienable rights  stipulated inthose very resolutions  be met  including respectof its sovereignty and security  lifting theblockade imposed on it  and applying paragraph14 of Resolution 687 (1991) to the Zionist entity 26as stipulated in the text and in the same manner asit was applied to Iraq.“I hereby declare before you that Iraq istotally clear of all nuclear  chemical andbiological weapons. If there are anyone amongstyou who might still worry that the fabricationsannounced by American officials about Iraq maypossibly be true  our country is ready to receiveany scientific experts accompanied by politiciansyou choose to represent any one of your countriesto tell us which places and scientific andindustrial installations they would wish to see particularly those about which the Americanofficials have been fabricating false stories alleging that they contain prohibited materials oractivities. If such experts and politicians visitIraq  we shall provide them with all the facilitiesthey need to achieve their objective  that is  to seethe true facts as they are.“As what matters for us basically is that ourrights  sovereignty and security be respected inaccordance with international law  we haveaccepted the return of the inspection teams toIraq  taking into consideration the arrangementsthat should safeguard these principles andachieve  with transparency  the goal of makingsure that Iraq no longer possesses nuclear biological and chemical weapons of massdestruction. Along with you  we are waiting to see.“The blockade imposed upon Iraq has beenin place for more than 12 years now  duringwhich time our assets and oil revenues have beenfrozen and we have been unable to use themexcept through an inefficient United Nations-runsystem that has already proven to be unfeasible.Substantial amounts of our revenues have beenillegitimately seized in a manner tantamount tolooting and contrary to the principles enshrined inthe United Nations Charter.“We therefore call for a discussion of theissue of the inspection teams in accordance withinternational law. That should be done on acomprehensive basis with a discussion of Iraq'sobligations  including the issue of the inspectionteams as well as the obligations of the SecurityCouncil towards Iraq  as stated in the resolutionsthemselves  particularly resolution 687 (1991).Reciprocal obligations exist of which the SecurityCouncil has implemented nothing  including theobligation to respect Iraq's sovereignty  which isbeing violated by America and Britain on a dailybasis through their ongoing aggression and theartificially drawn parallel latitude lines overnorthern and southern Iraq.“You may notice how the policy of theZionist entity  which has usurped Palestine andother Arab territories since 1948  and afterwards has now become as one with the policies andcapabilities of the United States.“The United States Administration has beenmaking up problems with Iraq in order to derailthe application of paragraph 14 of resolution 687(1991) and to prevent the Security Council fromlifting the blockade imposed on Iraq. The reasonlies in the fact that the counter-obligations underrelevant resolutions of the Security Council including resolution 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991 contain a clear paragraph demanding that theMiddle East be made a zone free from weapons ofmass destruction. Thus the AmericanAdministration does not want to embarrass theZionist entity or deprive it of the nuclear chemical and biological weapons it actuallypossesses. It is also because the United StatesAdministration is aware that Iraq has indeedhonoured all its obligations and is demanding along with other Arab countries  that paragraph14 be applied to the Zionist entity.“Iraq has been keen to see the inspectionissue discussed between the Security Council andIraq  through the United Nations Secretary-General and the representatives of Iraq  with aview to reaching a balanced formula based on theprinciples of the Charter and the relevantresolutions of the Security Council  and within acomprehensive solution which should bring to anend the cyclone of American accusations andfabricated crises against Iraq. At the same time this would reassure Iraq with regard to itssecurity  sovereignty  territorial integrity and itsright to choose its own way without interference in accordance with the rules established in theCharter of the United Nations.“The United States President said in hisspeech that Iraq is providing financial support tothe Palestinian people. My comment is that this is27correct. Yet we feel that the support we haveextended has not been as great as we would havehoped  because of the circumstances which havecurtailed our means. In extending this support  weact in accordance with the United Nations Charterand the resolutions of the Assembly  in which thenational struggle of peoples against occupationand colonialism is considered to be an inalienablenational right.“But what grounds does America and itsPresidents have to support the Zionist entity which has been occupying Palestine and otherArab territories and committing its criminalpolicy of killing Palestinians  destroying theirproperty and encroaching upon  and destroying the holy places of Muslims and Christians there?What principles and what laws does the AmericanPresident rely on in killing Iraqis  blockadingtheir country  destroying their property andinterfering in their internal affairs?”"
"82",3398,"ISL",57,2002,"﻿Allow me at theoutset to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly. I am confidentthat you will guide us wisely through the complex tasksahead.I would also like to use this opportunity towelcome Switzerland  our long-time friend and partnerin the European Free Trade Association  to the UnitedNations. Furthermore  I would like to express oursatisfaction that East Timor will be joining the UnitedNations later this month. The independence of EastTimor is one more example of how  in the end  thepurposes and principles of the United Nations prevail.The vicious and deliberately organized terroristattacks against the United States on 11 September oflast year have had global implications. The necessity tofight terrorism and the international commitment anddetermination to do so have dominated theinternational arena in the past year. Iceland reaffirmsits commitment to cooperate with the United Nationsand its Member States  as well as with other relevantinternational organizations  in the fight againstterrorism. To that end  we stress the importance forStates to ratify and implement all the relevant legalinstruments that together contribute to uprooting thatmenace.We should aim at concluding the draft comprehensiveconvention against terrorism during this session of theGeneral Assembly.On such important issues as peace and stability  itis often difficult to reach decisions and agree onresolutions here in the United Nations  let alone toensure that they are implemented. Full implementationof all relevant Security Council resolutions isimperative. It is therefore very encouraging to see thatduring this session of the General Assembly  we havewitnessed that the emerging consensus on how to dealwith defiance of Security Council resolutions seems tobe having tangible results. Only yesterday  the IraqiGovernment informed the United Nations that Iraq hasdecided to cooperate fully with the Organization and togive weapons inspectors unconditional access to thecountry. This is certainly a positive sign  but deeds willhave to follow.In a recent visit to the Middle East  my belief wasconfirmed that there must be a much strongerinvolvement of the international community in theMiddle East and involvement of third parties in theefforts to resolve the dispute there. In this regard Iceland fully supports the efforts of the Quartet  as wellas the Saudi proposals. Negotiations on a politicalsettlement must resume; they must not be held hostageto the situation on the ground. Only a comprehensivepeace agreement dealing with all aspects of the disputewill guarantee security and prosperity for both Israelisand Palestinians.The occupation of the Palestinian territories mustend  in line with Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973). Iceland strongly supports thetwo-States solution. Israel and Palestine must live sideby side in peace within secure and recognised borders.Until a peace agreement has been reached  bothparties have to play by certain rules. The sanctity of thelives of innocent civilians has to be respected under allcircumstances. This means that the PalestinianAuthority must reform itself to deal effectively withterror and pave the way for the establishment of ademocratic and accountable Palestinian State. Israelalso has to respect international humanitarian law inthe occupied Palestinian territories  including EastJerusalem. The circumstances on the ground have tochange for the better. Otherwise  there is a real dangerthat the worsening of the economic situation in theoccupied Palestinian territories could lead to ahumanitarian disaster.Iceland strongly welcomes the entry into force ofthe Rome Statute establishing the InternationalCriminal Court (ICC). We urge all States that have notalready done so to ratify or accede to the Statute withthe aim of achieving universality in the fight againstimpunity for the most serious international crimes.The ICC certainly is one of the majoraccomplishments of the international community instrengthening the international legal system. Some10concerns have been voiced with regard to the possibleabuse of the Rome Statute. These concerns should becarefully studied with an open mind and withoutprejudice to the effective functioning of the ICC.Constant vigilance is needed to ensure respect forhuman rights and humanitarian law. Our continuousefforts to combat terrorism must not result in any formof human rights violations. All measures taken must bein accordance with international law.Allow me to dwell on human rights issuesaffecting women and children. Unfortunately  women'srights are sometimes viewed as a purely social issuerather than a human rights issue. More often than not women are the prime victims of conflicts. Yet theirright to participate on an equal footing in peacenegotiations and decision-making processes is still notrecognized. Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) ismeant to change this  and its provisions must beimplemented and respected.While progress has been made towards greatergender equality  the situation in many countries is stilldire. Trafficking in women has increased  not least inEurope. The resumption of ancient methods ofpunishment of women in some parts of the world isappalling. Lack of education  information and healthcare  as well as sexual exploitation  makes womenparticularly vulnerable to the growing malice ofHIV/AIDS.The well-being of children is our responsibility.All over the world  millions of children suffer becauseof poverty. They are cruelly exploited as child soldiersor labourers. They do not enjoy their right to educationand are deprived of the decent life they are entitled to.Iceland therefore welcomed the special session onchildren held last spring. The participation of childrenthemselves was especially successful. We need to listento our children and make every effort to implement thedeclaration and plan of action of the special session  aswell as the international Convention on the Rights ofthe Child.Sustainable development has become an integralpart of policies and strategies of local and nationalgovernments  international organizations  businessesand non-governmental organizations worldwide.Despite impressive progress made in many fieldsduring the past decade  especially with regard to theenvironment  millions of people still live in povertyand see little hope of escaping it. It is essential thatpoorer countries be allowed to enjoy the benefits oftheir comparative advantages and to put their humanresources to work. Trade liberalization and freecommerce would be a major contribution to promotingequitable and sustainable growth for the benefit ofpoorer countries.At the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment in Johannesburg  world leaderssucceeded in generating commitments for action. Thisis a major accomplishment. It is now up to each andevery one of us to see to it that these commitments areimplemented.At the Summit  Iceland declared its willingness toincrease its bilateral development assistance byproviding training in the sustainable management ofliving marine resources and the use of renewableenergy resources. A huge step forward in thedevelopment and utilization of renewable  clean energyresources is necessary in order to fulfil thecommitments laid down in the Kyoto Protocol.Sustainable management and utilization of all livingmarine resources is essential for food security andhunger alleviation.The United Nations Convention on the Law of theSea is without doubt one of the greatest achievementsof this Organization. For a country like Iceland  whichis overwhelmingly dependent on the sustainableutilization of living marine resources  the Conventionis of paramount importance. In our view  it is highlyappropriate that the General Assembly will devote twodays during its fifty-seventh session forcommemorating the twentieth anniversary of theopening for signature of the Convention on the Law ofthe Sea.The Convention on the Law of the Sea has gaineduniversal participation  and all the three institutionsestablished by it are functioning in an effective manner.We welcome the entry into force last December of therelated Agreement on the Conservation andManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and HighlyMigratory Fish Stocks. It is imperative that both theConvention and the Agreement be ratified by thoseStates that have not done so  that they be fullyimplemented and that their integrity be preserved.In the Millennium Declaration we resolved tostrengthen the United Nations system in order to makeit more effective. In this context the revitalization ofthe General Assembly is important. Reform measuressuch as the clustering of agenda items and  mostrecently  the election in advance of the President andVice-Presidents of the General Assembly and theChairpersons of the Main Committees  are steps in theright direction. However  we must strive to deepen thereforms on the basis of the Millennium Declaration.In many crisis situations in this past year  as sooften before  the Security Council has proven effectiveand fulfilled a task satisfactorily. However  we mustnot forget that the reform of the Security Councilremains an issue that needs to be resolved. TheCouncil's efficiency in coping with the serious issueson its agenda must be further secured by makingnecessary changes and adjustments with regard to itscomposition and working methods.It is essential that the membership of the Councilfairly reflect the whole membership of the UnitedNations. It is also important to further enhance thetransparency in the decision-making process. In orderto move the reform work forward  all Member Statesmust show flexibility and willingness to compromise.We continue to face serious threats tointernational peace and stability. The best way topreserve the peace and work for prosperity anddemocracy in the world is to be steadfast in working infull compliance with the Charter of the United Nationsand the resolutions of its organs. No nation shall beallowed to destroy this common endeavour."
"83",3445,"ISR",57,2002,"﻿I would like to congratulatemy friend Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to thepresidency of the General Assembly and to wish himsuccess. I also thank the Secretary-General for hisleadership and his dedication to right what is wrongand to light the lamps of hope.The eleventh of September gave rise to a newworld. We find ourselves facing a new confrontation:borderless  merciless  indiscriminate and inhumane.The target this time was the United States — a UnitedStates that in the past helped so many nations defendtheir freedoms and their liberty. Now the United Stateshas been challenged again to defend our freedom byprotecting its own and to safeguard our lives bysecuring its own.The attack on the World Trade Center precipitateda new division in our epoch and in the years to come —a divide created by groups that preach and cause deathand agony. On the wrong side of the divide are thosewho are trying to destroy the free world  which isdiversified and heterogeneous  cherishing the right toevery thought and religion as well as the principle thatevery human being has the right to be different and yetto prosper and live in security.10The front from Bin Laden to Saddam Hussein is amenace to us all. It will not enable peace  nor will itpermit freedom — for all people or for their ownpeople. In countries that harbour terror  women arediscriminated against  men are oppressed  civil andhuman rights are violated  and the poor cannot escapefrom their poverty They force us to defend ourinalienable right to look ahead with hope. Theyimposed on us a war of self-defence — the defence ofpluralism and of the promise of science. They reject theincredible technologies that may carry us from thelimits of land to the discovery of uncharted provinces.The culture of death forces us to defend the culture oflife  to win battles that we did not initiate  to triumph inthis uninvited war.We never imagined that it could be dangerous towalk our streets  to fly our skies  to breathe the air or todrink the water. We cannot agree to this. We cannotallow dark forces — which  as we are aware  coulddestroy the lives of innocent people on a whim — topossess weapons of mass destruction. We shall not turnour lives into a series of sleepless nights andnightmarish days.We do not have the right to ignore the danger. Wedo not have the option to postpone it; it is imminent.We have to win as soon as possible.Terror is destined to lose. It will be defeatedbecause it carries no hope. It respects neither humanbeings nor the values of humanity.Science and technology made the economyglobal  and science and technology globalized terror aswell. Now strategy also is globalized  because ballisticranges have replaced geographic distances  becausenon-conventional warheads have replaced measurableexplosives  because terrorism transcends frontiers andfronts. Terrorists do not respect the rule of law. Theydo not answer to independent judges or relate toelected leaders. They mock international lines. Theydestroy universal norms. They shed blood. Theyintroduced dullness and stopped affluence. Nothing isto be expected from them but death.Terror creates poverty more than poverty createsterror. Terror leads to backwardness. We have to offerthe economic potential to open prospects and horizonsfor all nations  poor and rich. New opportunities canbring enfranchisement. We have to close ranks toprevent distorted dreams from becoming a ragingtyphoon that reaches all four corners of the globe. Wehave experienced in our own country the terribleeffects of terrorism.Babies were shot in the arms of their mothers.People at prayer were killed while praying. Yes  it hurtus  but it did not change our goals. We mourn  but wedid not bury peace.It harmed the Palestinians in the United Statesand in other countries. It prevented the occupationfrom ending. It introduced additional problems and didnot solve a single existing problem.Alas  the Middle East is still replete withnational  religious and territorial disputes. The land issmall; the agony is great. But the real tragedy is thatwithout terror we could already have resolved thesedisputes. Terror entrenched them. Terror changedpriorities — security before policy. It affectedresources — arming young men  for example  insteadof desalinating vital water. If it continues  battlefieldswill create deserts of sorrow and days of darkness.Campuses of learning will be replaced by camps ofviolence.But this is neither a decree of heaven nor theverdict of man. It can  it should  it will be different.South Africa  Ireland  Yugoslavia and the Congoachieved more by talking than by shooting  more bydialogue than by dispute. We offered the Palestinians acomprehensive solution without the terror — a solutionthat was close to their national aspirations. We relatedto their desire to be free  to be equal  to beindependent. We agreed that they would have their landin accordance with United Nations resolutions. Butterror postponed their destiny. Terror postponed ourwillingness to end control over their lives. Smokingguns replaced the torches of peace.Now we are following the profound debate takingplace among the Palestinians. We respect it  becausedebate is the beginning of democracy. Whendemocracy prevails  peace undoubtedly will arrive. TheFatah organization apparently issued a call thatcontains some new approaches. I shall quote one ofthem:“We will build an independent State ofPalestine and a political system in accordancewith the principles of democracy  the rule of law with an independent judicial system  separationof power  respect for human rights  civil libertiesand a market economy.”We look upon these words as the dawn of adifferent season; we hope that it is spring. Reducingviolence will shorten political distances. Politicalhorizons are  in my judgement  within reach. Israelaccepts President Bush's vision. That vision issupported by the Quartet; it is endorsed by Arabcountries; it outlines a political goal and a timetable. Itcan be considered as both a road map and a calendar.What is needed now are wheels to propel the vehiclesof peace. An economic wheel is needed in order for usto move to a global market economy that leads toscience-based industry. A market economy can opengates and skies. An ecological wheel is needed to letair and water flow cleanly. Pollution is not national; wehave to work together to control it. Ecology haschanged history. In the past  bloodshed was about realestate  and real estate created divisions  demarcationand  unfortunately  wars as well. In our era  the battle isnot for real estate but for air  for water and for energy;it is about the fertility of the land  rather than its size.“Non-real” estate is not marked  nor can it be divided.Either we respect it unanimously  or we will bevictimized by its loss.Then there is the cultural wheel. Threecivilizations were born in the Middle East. They weremade manifest in the Bible  in the New Testament andin the Koran. We read them in different languages  yetwe pray to the same heavens. The descendants ofAbraham should behave like a family — with toleranceand solidarity. Spiritual leaders should pray for peace but they also need to preach it  call upon it andcontribute to it.The political wheel should not rotate in the samemisguided orbit as in the past. We have been throughfive wars in five decades — Palestinians  Egyptiansand Jordanians lost generations of young people. Wepaid heavily with young blood as a result of three terrorcampaigns. The time has come to comprehend that thereal triumph is in the harvest of peace  not in the seedsof another war. When we replace the war maps withpeace maps  we will discover that the differences wereminimal. The wars were appalling. We shall see thatthe promised land could have become the land ofpromise a long time ago.Without wars  our region will be able to bloomagain. We can separate politically into two States andcoordinate one economy. That will enable us to takeadvantage of the exceptional invitation that came fromboth the United States and a united Europe to partakein their economic opportunities.Tourism can flourish when terrorism has ended.Islands of high-tech excellence can be established.Millions of trees can be planted to produce a newclimate. We can make green our arid lands. We canbecome contributors  not dependants.The call of the future cannot be harmonized withthe voices of the past. Only new solutions can evoke agrandeur equal to the past. We do not have the right tosuspend it in the face of our children. Young Israelisand young Palestinians are entitled to a new life — alife of their own. While fighting terror  let us not fightpeople. While seeking freedom  let us not extendsubjugation.I should like to direct a comment to Syria. Thesame principle that enabled us both to participate in theMadrid conference a decade ago is still valid.A word to Lebanon: Israel is committed to theterritorial integrity of Lebanon. Israel respects its needfor real political independence. Lebanon should notpermit Hezbollah to destroy its own country. Hezbollahis not a party  it is a dangerous agenda. Lebanon shouldimmediately free Israeli prisoners and prisoners of war.The people of the Middle East should let bygonesbe bygones. Let us return to our traditions  whereprophets  not terrorists  told the future. Let us return toour landscape  where the blue skies did not surrender tothe heavy clouds of despair; to a time when justicepromised equal opportunities for individuals and fornations. Let us join  together  the march of mankindtowards new discoveries that will make life morepurposeful and may bring security to posterity.We were born in the cradles of hope  not in thetombs of despair. We guard our spiritual heritage  andit is not antithetical to building a new Middle East. Theworld is new.I should like to conclude with an old verse fromour scriptures:“The Lord led Adam through the Garden ofEden and said to him  ‘All I created  I created foryou. Beware lest you spoil and destroy my world for if you spoil it  there is no one to repair it afteryou'.”We are here to repair."
"84",3492,"ITA",57,2002,"﻿One year has gone bysince the terrorist attack on the United States  whichinflicted such deep wounds on the city that welcomesus today. By striking this city  this nation  thisdemocracy  the terrorists intended to strike at the heartof the whole community of nations and peoples thatembraces the United Nations and the values for whichit stands.But they failed in their purpose. Instead  theirbarbarous acts roused in all of us a common will torespond. Rather than divide us  they united us. Andunited we intend to respond to every new threat toworld security.The fight against terrorism is the crucialchallenge we must face today in order to defend humanvalues  the values of freedom  peace  justice anddevelopment which we all share.The United Nations is at the forefront of thisstruggle. We know that it will be a long and hard battle and we must therefore maintain the cohesion anddetermination that we have shown so far.But we are firmly convinced that this battle canbe won. Yesterday President Bush recalled theresponsibilities that we all share in this fight to defendfreedom  which is the greatest good and that fromwhich all other goods flow. Terrorism finds a breedingground wherever there is no freedom  wherever there isno democracy  but where there is hunger  misery anddespair.In order to defeat terrorism  we must globalizefreedom and democracy. In order to eradicateterrorism  we must promote an economic developmentwithout borders  a lasting development for all.My country has played a role in this strugglefrom the start and will continue to do so to the end enhancing the military  financial  judicial  police andintelligence cooperation that has already achievedimportant results. But we are also working to eradicatepoverty and disease. We are committed to pledging0.39 per cent of our gross domestic product to lessdeveloped countries  and we intend to reach the levelof 0.7 per cent.The African continent is crucial to our effort. It isa challenge to our conscience and represents a test ofour ability to help its countries to participate in a truedevelopment without borders.The Group of Eight's action plan for Africa launched in Genoa under Italy's presidency andapproved in Canada  responds to the need for a newform of solidarity between the most industrializedcountries and those which intend to become the ownersof their future.But an increase in financial aid is no longerenough. At the Kananaskis summit  we presented anaction plan aimed at achieving common standards ofgood governance  starting with our e-government'initiative  a completely computerized and digitalizeduniversal model of public accounting and of publicadministration and its primary functions.The adoption of this universal model  whichrespects the identity  traditions and culture of eachcountry  could produce several positive effects: clearand transparent public accounting; clear laws andregulations befitting the rule of law; more efficientservices for citizens and businesses; greater efficiencyin public administration; and  above all  greaterdemocracy. This will spark a virtuous circle  and donorcountries will finally have the certainty that theirassistance is truly delivered to needy populations.In this respect  three phases were outlined at theGroup of Eight meeting. In the first trial stage  thenecessary assistance will be provided to the countriesthat wish to adopt this system. At the end of this phase which might last three or four years  we can move onto a second phase in which the adoption of theuniversal system becomes a requirement for allcountries that apply for development assistance.Finally  there could be a third phase in which wecould ask the most industrialized countries to forge a23special partnership with specific countries  taking itupon themselves to implement specific projects.We are likewise convinced that public assistanceshould be supplemented by private assistance. AtKananaskis  we submitted an innovative proposalcalled de-tax'  whereby private citizens would be ableto allocate between 1 and 2 per cent of the price ofwhat they buy to the implementation of specificprojects  such as schools  hospitals or water-supplyfacilities in poor countries.At Genoa we also launched the Education forAll' plan and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria  to which Italy has pledged asubstantial contribution.But the poorer countries also need to be relievedof the burden of their debt so as to free up theresources they need for their growth. That is why Italyhas already cancelled $1 billion of debt and will sooncancel another $4 billion  until the complete write-offof all its credits.Our commitment to the United Nations is clear onall fronts. Italy is the sixth-largest contributor to theOrganization's regular budget and one of the largesttroop contributors. About 10 000 Italian soldiers aredeployed throughout the world  from the Balkans toAfghanistan  to preserve and maintain peace andsecurity. We will continue along that road  in our firmbelief that there is no problem that we cannot solve ifwe are united in our determination.As we speak today  the main challenge to theUnited Nations and our system of values is posed bythe regime that governs Iraq  which has systematicallyignored all the resolutions of the United Nations. Aresponse is indispensable to safeguard the internationalcommunity from the danger posed by a massive build-up of weapons of mass destruction.As President Bush so clearly stated  what wemust address today is precisely this repeated defianceof the United Nations and of the will of theinternational community. We must make use of all thediplomatic and political means available to address thissituation. But if things do not change substantially  itwill be necessary to act within the framework of theUnited Nations in order to safeguard global securityfrom a real threat.The lesson we must draw from the events of 11September is that haste can lead to carelessness  butdelay in taking the necessary action can have terribleconsequences. When terrorist attacks or threats topeace are carried out by networks or regimes that aimat destroying our way of life and our liberaldemocracies  then democracies have not only the rightbut also the duty to defend themselves.Let me now turn our attention to the Middle East.Italy supports the road map drawn up by the EuropeanUnion  as well as the action of the quartet' and therapid convening of an international conference toensure the peaceful coexistence of two independentStates within safe and secure borders.First of all  the spiral of violence must come to anend through the cessation of terrorist attacks. Theholding of free and fair elections will advance theprocess of democratic reform of the PalestinianNational Authority. But a lasting peace cannot beenvisaged unless we narrow the economic gap betweenthe Israelis and the Palestinians  giving the Palestiniansrealistic hope for jobs and development. With this goalin mind  Italy has presented a plan to rebuild andsupport the Palestinian economy. Italy has alreadyoffered to host the negotiations and the peaceconference.We are men and women of peace. We areconvinced that this new century cannot be left at themercy of criminal folly and fanaticism. We arecommitted to the fight against terrorism  and we willdo everything in our power to eradicate that evil and todefend our security and our future. We will lend ourefforts to the building of a true and just peace  the onlykind of peace for the just and the free."
"85",3538,"JAM",57,2002,"﻿On behalf of the delegationof Jamaica  I express congratulations to you  Sir  onyour assumption of the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. We pledge ourfull cooperation with you in the work of this session.We also express our deep gratitude to the outgoingPresident  Mr. Han Seung-soo  under whose guidancethe fifty-sixth session was successfully completed.Jamaica welcomes the Swiss Confederation as aMember of the family of the United Nations  and welook forward to welcoming East Timor when itassumes membership in the Organization later duringthis session.Forty years ago on this day  18 September Jamaica joined the family of the United Nations as its106th member. It was one of our first foreign policyinitiatives upon achieving independence. In taking thatstep  Jamaica signalled its readiness to assume itsobligations as a member of the internationalcommunity and to contribute to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and to the promotion31of economic and social progress through multilateralcooperation within the United Nations system. Today on its fortieth anniversary  Jamaica reaffirms its faith inthe United Nations and proclaims its unwaveringcommitment to multilateralism.Over its 40 years Jamaica has played its partthrough active participation in widening the reach ofthe United Nations into a range of activities andprogrammes critical to global development and worldpeace. Our policy is to support the strengthening of theUnited Nations system and to uphold its moralauthority. In a world of many nations with diverseinterests and of great disparities in wealth and militarypower  it is an indispensable instrument in thepromotion of the rule of law in international affairs andin the peaceful settlement of disputes.With the changing nature and growing complexityof international affairs  especially in the context ofglobalization and with the emergence of newchallenges to peace and security  the fulfilment of theUnited Nations' role remains critical. Now  more thanever before  we need to strengthen the structures andinstitutions of the international system to safeguard ourcommon interests in achieving a global order of peaceand economic and social progress for all.Over the past year  dramatic events have occurredwhich have brought old and new issues to the forefrontof attention. We recall the shock and horror of theterrorist attacks on 11 September; the ensuing war inAfghanistan; the outbreak of renewed violence in theMiddle East between Israelis and Palestinians; theescalation of old tensions in South Asia; and morerecently  the threat of a new war in Iraq. All of thesewere given special attention by the Secretary-Generalin the presentation of his report to the GeneralAssembly last Thursday. Jamaica commends theSecretary-General for the clarity of his vision on therole of the United Nations in the resolution of currentglobal problems.Of high importance on the agenda for immediateaction is the situation in the Middle East  whererecently we have witnessed so much death  destructionand human suffering  particularly among civilians. Itshould now be clear that the only true way to findpeace and security is through laying the foundations fora just and durable settlement. What is needed now is aplan to move the process forward towards theconvening of a peace conference. There has emerged asignificant level of consensus on the main elements ofa settlement — the withdrawal of Israel from occupiedPalestinian territory; the exercise of self-determinationfor the Palestinian people and the establishment ofarrangements for the two States of Israel and Palestineto coexist within clearly defined and internationallyrecognized boundaries. We believe it is important andurgent that advantage is taken of the present situationof relative calm to proceed towards negotiationsinvolving the leadership of Israel and the PalestinianAuthority.With regard to Iraq  which has been the subject ofso much debate in recent weeks  it is up to the SecurityCouncil to carry out its responsibilities in a mannerbroadly acceptable to the international community andto preclude unilateral actions that could lead tounpredictable consequences and to wider instability inthe region. This is an important moment for the UnitedNations  and we expect the Security Council to act inaccordance with the Charter to safeguard the integrityof the international system and to ensure themaintenance of peace.To make the world a safer place requiresmeasures to be adopted on a broad front. Theelimination of terrorism is a task requiring cooperationby the entire international community. Thecomprehensive measures set out in Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001) establish the framework foraction  and Jamaica is doing its part in that effort. Atthe same time  it should be recognized that forachievement of the long-term objectives  it is necessaryto address the root causes of terrorism in their political economic  social and psychological dimensions. It isalso important that  in the campaign against terrorism there should be no targeting or stigmatizing ofparticular ethnic groups or religious communities; norshould it become the basis for intolerance  persecutionor discrimination against minority groups or for theviolation of human rights.Linked to the question of terrorism are securityproblems arising from the continued growth in theillicit trade in narcotics and the illicit transfer of gunsand other weapons which have become inseparableelements in the operations of transnational crime. Thisis particularly the case in the Caribbean  where thisphenomenon has assumed alarming proportions in theera of globalization. A growing network of illicit tradehas developed in drugs and weapons  which issubverting the internal security of our Caribbean States32and threatening social stability. We acknowledgeongoing efforts at the regional and bilateral levels toaddress these security concerns  but more needs to bedone  particularly in regulating  monitoring andreporting transfers in small arms in jurisdictions inwhich these weapons are produced.These are some of the negative features thataccompany globalization and add to the problemsfacing developing countries. The globalization of trade finance and the means of production presents evengreater challenges. The contraction of overalldevelopment assistance (ODA) and foreign directinvestment flows  and the volatility in short-termcapital flows  have resulted over time in declininggrowth rates and increasing poverty  thus widening thegap between rich and poor countries. The opportunitiesfor economic growth and prosperity promised byglobalization have  therefore  not materialized for themajority. Instead  developing countries have beenplaced in peril in a system in which survival willremain an uphill struggle against dislocation andmarginalization. Without some arrangement to promotegreater equity in the sharing of the benefits ofglobalization  we will witness a pattern of continuedenrichment of only those endowed with the resources capital stocks and technology  who can reap theadvantages of competitiveness.In this context  the very important forums heldduring the past year  which sought to advance thedevelopment agenda  were both timely and welcome.At Doha last November  there was someacknowledgement of the wide differences in levels ofdevelopment and capacity of States  and theconsequential need for special and differentialtreatment for developing countries. We look forward tohaving these principles incorporated into thearchitecture of World Trade Organization rules. This for us  would be an important step in pursuing adevelopment dimension within the trade agenda. Sincetrade is the engine of development  it is vital that realopportunities be made available in export markets fordeveloping country products  without the barriers  invarious forms  which continue to hamper market accessand restrict the expansion of exports.There should also be significant strengthening ofproductive capacity through new investment andcapital transfers to developing countries. At Monterreyin March  we sought to put in place a framework forthe more effective mobilization of resources fordevelopment from many critical sources. Someindications were given of ODA increases  which wewelcome  although these still fall below the agreedtargets. In the absence of a system of globalgovernance that would assure equity in investmentopportunity and protection from the volatility ofprivate financial flows  official sources of financeremain a critical form of development assistance. It is therefore  important that these new resources are madeavailable to achieve concrete results without thecomplications of conditionalities and selectiveprocessing.As we pursue implementation of the MonterreyConsensus and the Doha Agenda  we also look forwardto progress in the democratization of the decision-making process within the international system forfinance and trade. For it is only when developingcountries are accorded fair space and an effective voicein the setting of international finance and trade policiesthat we will begin to see greater equity in thedistribution of the world's wealth.Most recently  in Johannesburg  we embraced anew opportunity to advance the sustainabledevelopment agenda by furthering progress in theimplementation of Agenda 21. We welcome theimportant new targets agreed  which give fullerexpression to the commitment of the internationalcommunity to the Millennium Development Goals. Thereal test will be to see whether the commitments aretranslated into action  through the mobilization ofresources  to meet the requirements of the programmeand the targets that have been set. Johannesburg is thusthe climax of an important year that reshaped andrefocused the development priorities of the globalcommunity for the new millennium. For sustainabledevelopment will not be achieved without financing fordevelopment  nor without a development agenda intrade. Jamaica welcomes in particular the commitmentsmade at Johannesburg in respect of small islanddeveloping States (SIDS). We continue to underscorethe need for special attention to be paid to thechallenges of vulnerability faced by SIDS. What isneeded is a fair opportunity to secure the welfare of ourpeople  and to protect our fragile environment.This cannot be achieved without the full supportof the international community. The BarbadosProgramme of Action  adopted in 1994  representedthat commitment of support. As we now prepare toreview its implementation in 2004  we encourage33renewed engagement on those issues critical to ourvery survival  such as the dangers posed by globalwarming  sea level rise and natural disasters.Jamaica welcomes the positive indications forAfrica  where the reduction of political conflict andturmoil offers a real opportunity for building stabilityand economic progress. Africa has suffered for far toolong from a myriad of difficult problems and should begiven a new start.The formation of the African Union and theinauguration of the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD) are commendable initiativesaimed at bringing Africa closer to the mainstream ofinternational development  at containing the HIV/AIDSpandemic and at combating the spread of poverty. Whatare really needed now are resources and we urge thatevery effort be made to ensure that the new initiativesachieve a breakthrough for African development.In the field of social development and humanrights  the United Nations has made significantachievements in extending and promoting the rights ofpersons in vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.Notwithstanding those achievements  the Organizationis faced with growing social challenges  including theHIV/AIDS pandemic  which threaten to reversedecades of progress in many parts of the world.Concerted action to control the spread of this diseaseshould remain a priority of the Organization. So tooshould be the protection of the rights of children. Thespecific time-bound targets adopted during the specialsession on children require our unequivocalcommitment.One of the important areas of contribution on thepart of the United Nations is in the development ofinternational law as a means of promoting universallyaccepted rules and the creation of multilateral legalregimes to achieve common goals. The most recentachievement is the Rome Statute on the InternationalCriminal Court (ICC)  which came into force in July2002.Another outstanding example is the UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This year the international community will be observing the 20thAnniversary of its signing  which took place atMontego Bay  Jamaica on 10 December 1982. Theimmense significance of this Convention insafeguarding the interests of all countries  in theexploitation of ocean resources  and in maritime issueshas been widely acknowledged.We applaud the work being carried out by the twoinstitutions that have evolved out of the Convention —the International Seabed Authority (ISA)  which isentrusted with the implementation of the concept of thecommon heritage of mankind  and the InternationalTribunal for the Law of the Sea  which is the forum forresolving maritime disputes under the Convention.This is a good example of the result of workingtogether to achieve common solutions through amultilateral process to advance the common interest. Itshows that the United Nations is working. We shouldsafeguard and strengthen it as the guardian of ourcommon future."
"86",3584,"JOR",57,2002,"﻿I wishat the outset to extend to you  Sir  and to your friendlycountry  the Czech Republic  warm congratulations onyour election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. Your record ofprudence and diplomatic skill will certainly beinstrumental in meeting the lofty goals sought by allnations and peoples. A word of thanks and tribute goesto your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. HanSeung-soo  for his outstanding stewardship of the fifty-sixth session.Two States are being admitted to the membershipof our Organization: the Swiss Confederation and soon  the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. Despite9their differing histories  each will strengthen the fabricand enrich the tapestry of the United Nations. Jordanbids a warm welcome to both of them and wishes themwell.The opening of the current session coincided withthe first anniversary of the heinous terrorist attacksagainst New York City  Washington  D.C.  andPennsylvania. As I reiterate Jordan's condemnation ofthose terrorist acts  let me express once again our deepcondolences and sympathy to the families of thethousands of victims who lost their lives as a result ofthe cowardly and criminal acts that targeted ourOrganization's host city and host nation. The list ofvictims is multinational  multi-ethnic  multi-religiousand multicultural. That graphically illustrates the factthat terrorism is indeed blind to all those criteria. Theinternational community rose to the occasion when itprovided a prompt  collective  decisive response.Indeed  it was the United Nations itself that providedthe forum for a global coalition underpinned by bothour common political will and the compelling casebefore us. Thus  the Assembly adopted resolution 56/1 while the Security Council adopted its resolutions 1368(2001) and 1373 (2001). That set of decisions embraced by our world body  which represents allhuman cultures  ideologies and ethnicities  created theofficial platform for launching the ongoing globalcampaign against terrorism.My country  Jordan  has also suffered fromterrorism and its evils. Terrorists have struck at ournational symbols  our citizens and our interests becauseof our principled positions  foremost among them ourfirm commitment to fight terrorism. All along  Jordanhas been in the vanguard of every international effortaimed at hunting down this plague and confronting it including by draining its resources as part of an overalldrive to uproot it altogether.In parallel  Jordan's stance is clear-cut anddecisive. We reject and condemn terrorism in all itsforms and manifestations. We have declared in nouncertain terms this firm conviction against terrorism irrespective of its source  the perpetrators or theidentity of the victims. Furthermore  we allow no roomfor any justification whatsoever  including any possiblearguments on religious  ethnic or national grounds.Thus  Jordan treats all forms of terrorism as criminalacts.In the same context  let me stress our convictionthat the eradication of terrorism is a common goal ofall States and societies. I wish therefore to draw theAssembly's attention to the blatant tendency  driven bypernicious and wicked intentions  to falsely linkterrorism to a specific religion or culture. I trust thatthis gathering shares my view that it is now imperativeto confront these dubious attempts. Indeed  dealingwith such schemes is indispensable if we are tomaintain the sustained and concerted campaign toachieve the paramount objective: the total eradicationof terrorism.The current situation in the Middle East isextremely dangerous. The whole landscape isconstantly changing for the worse  especially in theoccupied Palestinian territories. Israel's reoccupationof the Palestinian Authority's territories and theperpetuation of this occupation  together with themeasures and policies emanating thereof  particularlypolicies of closure and siege  have created intolerableliving conditions for the Palestinian people. Theseunbearable conditions have prompted severalhumanitarian agencies and international organs todeclare a state of emergency. Israeli measures tostrangle the Palestinian people economically andpolitically  with a view to bringing the Palestinians totheir knees and to coercing them into surrendering theirrights  have reached inadmissible levels of seriousness.Malnutrition rates among the Palestinian populationhave doubled. Diseases related to malnutrition andhunger have become widespread  particularly amongchildren  women and the elderly. The joint impact of allthese factors has created breeding grounds forfrustration and despair  which inevitably generatehatred  grudges and violence.Therefore  this situation must be addressedeffectively and expeditiously. We hope that the firstmove will come from Israel in the form of ending itsoccupation of Palestinian towns without delay. We alsoexpect Israel to cease forthwith its policies of closuresand siege. It is in Israel's interest to pursueconstructive policies towards the Palestinians in orderto restore mutual confidence and to rehabilitate thevalues of reconciliation and coexistence between thetwo peoples. It is our considered view that Israel'scurrent approach is irrational  as it results in excessiveuse of force  which in turn fuels and deepens hatredand replenishes the sources of violence.10While we welcome the few visible signs of relief as reflected in the accord reached by the Palestinianand Israeli sides on 19 August 2002  which calls forprogressive withdrawal by Israel from certainPalestinian towns that have been reoccupied by Israel we call on Israel to implement faithfully andexpeditiously Security Council resolution 1402 (2002) which provides for full Israeli withdrawal from allPalestinian cities.From a political and humanitarian point of view Jordan stands against targeting Israeli civilians andconcurs with the need to address the whole spectrum ofsecurity issues. However  it maintains that the onlyviable course for addressing the Palestinian-Israeliquestion lies in the resumption of the peace process asa whole  from the point where it stalled and within theagreed framework established on the basis of completeIsraeli withdrawal from all Arab territories occupiedsince 1967  including the Palestinian  Syrian andLebanese territories; the establishment of anindependent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem asits capital  pursuant to relevant Security Councilresolutions  particularly 242 (1967)  338 (1973)  425(1978) and 1397 (2002).In that context  I wish to stress the significance ofthe initiative adopted by the Arab leaders at the BeirutArab Summit last March. That initiative outlined abalanced approach in terms of practical ideas andarguments that demonstrate beyond any doubt agenuine pan-Arab commitment to just  lasting andcomprehensive peace. That plan is a pledge by ArabStates to conclude peace agreements with Israel inreturn for its complete withdrawal from the Palestinian Syrian and Lebanese territories to the 4 June 1967borders  the establishment of an independentPalestinian State with East Jerusalem its capital andfinding a just and agreed solution to the Palestinianrefugees question on the basis of the relevant UnitedNations resolutions.I trust that the Government of Israel will rise tothe level of the hopes and aspirations of the Arabpeoples and the people of Israel to live in peace  justiceand dignity. We hope that the Government of Israel willbe forthcoming in response to that balanced and sincereinitiative  which gained the acceptance of all States andparties interested in the peace process. Furthermore this initiative is also in line with the vision and thecommitment outlined by President George W. Bush ofthe United States on the form and aim of a finalsolution on the Palestinian-Israeli track based on theestablishment of an independent Palestinian stateexisting alongside the State of Israel by mid-2005 atthe latest.In that regard  Jordan supports efforts being madeto draw up a clear road map leading to theimplementation of President Bush's commitmentthrough  first  defining the obligations of both thePalestinian and Israeli sides; secondly  setting a cleartimetable for all phases of carrying out thoseobligations so that the deadline for the birth of theindependent Palestinian State will not  under anycircumstances  extend beyond mid-2005; and  thirdly agreeing to the creation of an international supervisorymechanism that ensures the timely and orderlyimplementation of those measures as well asmonitoring the implementation process.We hope that this vision will be examined at theQuartet meeting in New York within the next few days with a view to adopting it into a plan of action and acomprehensive international obligation. Subsequently the parties will embark on the implementation processwithin the specified framework  whose outcome will bethe establishment of an independent Palestinian Statewithin less than three years. We also hope that thisachievement will generate a fresh impetus to concludecomprehensive peace on the Syrian-Israeli andLebanese-Israeli tracks within the same time frame.In compliance with the United Nations principlesenshrined in the Charter  particularly Article 2 paragraph 4  which prohibits the threat or use of forcein international relations  and considering that this rightis exclusively assigned to the Security Council so thatthe Council may exercise it in case of a breach ofinternational peace and security  Jordan believes thatthe most appropriate means for resolving the mattersoutstanding between the United Nations and Iraq is toensure the immediate and full implementation of allrelevant Security Council resolutions  including thoserelating to Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons aswell as to the return of the weapons inspectors. If theseconditions are met  the people of Iraq  who have beensuffering for too long  would be saved from militaryaction that would exacerbate that suffering. Theaforementioned formula would also spare the entireregion the dire consequences of military operations.In the context of emphasizing the principle ofresolving disputes by peaceful means  we invite theIslamic Republic of Iran to respond to the call made bythe United Arab Emirates to reach a peacefulsettlement of the problem of the three islands. We urgeIran to accept referral of this case to the InternationalCourt of Justice. We also encourage the efforts madeby the two sides in Cyprus to reach a just and peacefulsolution to the Cypriot question. We also call for thepeaceful resolution of the dispute between India andPakistan over Kashmir. We have no doubt that theAssembly will support and strengthen those efforts.Jordan recognizes the nature of thetransformations that have taken place in internationalrelations and the global landscape over the past decade.Thus  we stress the need for the United Nations toadapt accordingly  through effective streamlining  sothat it will maintain its relevance as the primaryinternational forum of global cooperation andcoordination in all human fields. A robust UnitedNations would also remain the true embodiment of thehopes and the aspirations of all mankind.Here  I wish to pay special tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the foresight  dynamism andflexibility he brings into play while performing hisduties. Those fine personal qualities enhance hisimpressive performance  which Jordan supports andappreciates.In closing  I would like to warmly welcome theestablishment of the International Criminal Court andthe entry into force of its Statute. Our expectation isthat the Court will enhance the great principles andpurposes of the United Nations itself. Let me underlineour absolute support for all efforts aimed atstrengthening and revitalizing the United Nationssystem  including the ongoing structural reformexercise and the review of Security Councilmembership with a view to its expansion in order tomake it more representative of the new internationalrealities. Finally  I wish the Assembly all success in itsdeliberations."

Japan heartily supports itsadmission to the membership of the United Nations.The Peace Bell in the garden of United NationsHeadquarters was presented to the United Nations in1954 by the Japanese people with a prayer for worldpeace. It has been rung every year for world peace. Thebeautiful sound of the bell  which was made from coinscollected from all over the world  reminds us of whatthe United Nations represents.In order to ensure world peace and prosperity  weneed to harmonize a range of efforts which encompassnot only military measures  but also initiatives for thesolution of poverty problems and the establishment ofsocial infrastructures that will put an end to humanrights violations. The United Nations should be aforum where the contributions of each and every Stateare consolidated and implemented in the most efficientmanner. No single State or organization can accomplishthis. Only the United Nations is capable of carrying outsuch a lofty task.In this connection  I would like to refer to theissue of Iraq  which is of grave concern to theinternational community. Iraq must comply with all therelevant Security Council resolutions. In particular Iraq must allow immediate and unconditionalinspections and dispose of all weapons of massdestruction. It is important for the internationalcommunity to continue to work together and to engagemore strenuously in diplomatic efforts through theUnited Nations. In doing so  we must pursue theadoption of necessary and appropriate Security Councilresolutions as soon as possible.Terrorism remains a critical issue this year.Today  in addition to terrorism  I would like to take upother major challenges which the United Nations mustaddress and to describe Japan's contributions in thoseareas  namely  the consolidation of peace and nation-building  the environment and development  andnuclear disarmament. I will also touch upon my ideasfor the realization of United Nations reform  which isessential in order for this Organization to tackle thesechallenges successfully.The first challenge is the fight against terrorism.Just after the terrorist attacks on 11 September  Ivisited ground zero. Seeing with my own eyes themagnitude of the destruction  I was speechless at theenormity of the terrorist attack. 11 September is achallenge not only to the United States  but also to allhumankind. The prevention and eradication ofterrorism are an important task for the United Nationsand  indeed  for all Member States.Japan calls upon all States to accede tointernational conventions related to terrorism. It isimportant to develop international norms in this area such as a comprehensive convention on internationalterrorism and an international convention for thesuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. Safe havensfor terrorists cannot be allowed. Japan will furtherstrengthen its domestic counter-terrorism measures.Consulting closely with the Counter-TerrorismCommittee of the Security Council  it will share itsknowledge and expertise in counter-terrorism measureswith those States that are in need of it. Japan willrespond to threats where weapons of mass destructionmight be used in acts of terrorism by actively joiningthe efforts of the international community to preventthe proliferation of these weapons.18The second challenge is the consolidation ofpeace and nation-building. Japan attaches greatimportance to extending post-conflict assistance for theconsolidation of peace and nation-building to preventthe recurrence of conflicts. Having developed amechanism to enable it to cooperate effectively inbroader areas  Japan has entered a new stage in itscooperation with peacekeeping operations. Thispositive posture is manifested in its deployment sinceFebruary of 690 Self-Defence Force personnel  mainlyas an engineer group  to the peacekeeping operation inEast Timor. Japan will enhance its cooperation in otherareas as well  such as demining  rehabilitation ofinfrastructure  elections and the establishment ofsystems for internal security.Concerning Afghanistan  at the InternationalConference on Reconstruction Assistance toAfghanistan held in Tokyo in January  Japan strove tosolidify the resolve of the international community. Weare now preparing a programme to assist thedemobilization and reintegration of former combatants which will give form to our proposed Register forPeace. My country is also contributing to regionalreconstruction by developing an assistance project forthe resettlement of refugees and displaced people insuch areas as Kandahar.In the Middle East  it is crucial that the vision ofthe peaceful coexistence of Israel and an independentPalestinian State materialize as early as possible. Japanwill assist the reform of the Palestinian Authority which is aimed at the establishment of a new State bythe Palestinian people. We will do so particularly byproviding technical assistance for democratization.Elections by the Palestinians are the first step towardsnation-building and I believe that the internationalcommunity should extend assistance to ensure theirsuccess. However  putting an end to the vicious circleof violence remains our most urgent task. Japanresolutely condemns terrorist acts by Palestinianextremists and strongly urges Israel to immediatelywithdraw its troops to the line of September 2000  haltits military operations and lift the economic closures inthe autonomous areas.In Africa  peace and stability are prerequisites fordevelopment. We are encouraged by the positivemovements in that continent  such as the realization ofpeace in Angola and a partial ceasefire in Sudan. Japanwill actively support the efforts of African States forconflict resolution and the consolidation of peace.The third challenge is the simultaneousachievement of environmental protection anddevelopment. Towards that end  it is of courseimportant to utilize all available financial resources andto develop human resources  which are the engine ofnation-building. However  ownership by developingcountries and their partnership with the internationalcommunity  which supports their ownership  are alsoessential.In this respect  we welcome the development ofthe New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD) and the establishment of the African Unionas manifestations of ownership by African countries. Inorder to help strengthen both African ownership andthe partnership with the international community  andbuilding on the results of the successful World Summiton Sustainable Development that took place inJohannesburg  Japan will convene the third TokyoInternational Conference on African Development(TICAD III) in October 2003. Also  in pursuit ofsustainable development  it will host an internationalministerial-level conference on water in Kyoto inMarch 2003. Japan will continue to participate activelyin worldwide actions for environmental protection anddevelopment by providing expertise and takingconcrete action.Fourthly  I would like to touch upon the nucleardisarmament issue. I believe that Japan  as the onlycountry in human history to have suffered nucleardevastation  has a significant role to play in nucleardisarmament and non-proliferation. Japan will continueits efforts to realize a peaceful and safe world  free ofnuclear weapons  as early as possible. To that end  wewill propose a draft resolution entitled A path to thetotal elimination of nuclear weapons' at this session ofthe General Assembly  and we will redouble our effortsto achieve the early entry into force of theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.When addressing these challenges  we mustensure that the variety of measures taken by MemberStates are effectively coordinated. The United Nationsmust exercise its leadership in this endeavour. We  thatis all Member States  must breathe new life into theUnited Nations by strengthening its functions throughreforms. Next year  the debate on Security Councilreform will enter its tenth year. I believe that we should19now focus our discussion on such questions as thenumber of seats on an enlarged Security Council. Japanintends to work hard to that end. In this connection  Iwould remind all Member States of the question of theenemy State' clauses  meaningless legacies of thetwentieth century  that remain in the United NationsCharter.Since assuming office as Prime Minister in April2001  I have proceeded with a series of reforms toenable Japan to respond appropriately to the new era.The United Nations also must continue to reform itselfso as to respond to new situations in the world byconstantly reviewing its organization and functions.The prescription for reform is already shown in theMillennium Declaration. In order to achieve the goalscontained in the Declaration and build a more peaceful prosperous and just world  every Member State shouldrenew its determination to achieve reform in the UnitedNations and take actions toward that end. Japan willmake its utmost efforts to ensure that the UnitedNations is able to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century."
"88",3656,"KAZ",57,2002,"﻿Allow me first tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to the highoffice of the presidency of the current session and toexpress confidence that  under your able leadership  thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly will besuccessful and fruitful.The terrorist acts in the United States  theanniversary of which we have just marked with greatsorrow  prompted all mankind to pay close attention tothe fundamental issues of sustainable development.The barbaric acts of international terroristsdemonstrated very convincingly the fragility of theworld we live in and the importance for all States tojoin their efforts to ensure economic development andcivil rights  security and stability.The contemporary world  with all the diversity ofits political and economic systems  requires  as neverbefore  agreed and coordinated efforts by thecommunity of nations to protect common humanvalues  primarily the rights of all citizens to a decentlife.Has mankind been able to rid itself of its ownentrenched flaws — poverty  environmental pollution disease and crime? The answer is more than evident:the community of nations has not made progress inresolving those issues. Thus  breeding grounds havebeen created for the spread of such dangerousphenomena as terrorism and drug trafficking  religiousextremism and the illegal arms trade. Having crossedthe threshold of the new millennium  mankind has beenforced to exert efforts to resolve centuries-old issuesand to counter new threats.The events that took place last year have changedthe world and have prompted everybody to think hardabout the foundations that support it. The communityof nations faces a pressing task: to create a newarchitecture of global security based on a multi-polarworld  and to set up effective mechanisms to overcomethe obstacles to modern economic and politicaldevelopment.In our view  under these circumstances  the roleand the responsibility of international institutions primarily the United Nations  become significantlygreater. Strengthening the authority of the UnitedNations is our common responsibility. We believe thatthe existing system of adopting decisions affecting thefundamental interests of mankind should never bedoubted  let alone reshaped in any way. The issues ofthe world and peace should be considered anddecisions reflecting the will and the interests of thecommunity of nations should be adopted only withinthe framework of the United Nations.Grounds for the use of force against MemberStates should be irrefutable evidence  corroborated byinternational institutions  of their illegal action todisrupt the world order and to undermine global andregional security.The changed world forces us to take a fresh lookat disarmament issues  primarily the consolidation ofthe non-proliferation regime. It is becoming more andmore evident that  under these new conditions  thecommunity of nations should focus its main efforts onpreventing terrorists from getting hold of weapons ofmass destruction. Therefore  joint action by MemberStates to continue to consolidate the non-proliferationregime and to make it universal deserve specialattention. We believe that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  which bindsits participants to take nuclear disarmament measures 9should continue to play an important role in the area ofnuclear arms control.As one of the few States in the world that havevoluntarily relinquished their nuclear heritage  webelieve that a prerequisite for an atmosphere of trust incontemporary international relations is the early entryinto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty (CTBT).Because it attaches great significance to thepreservation of peace and security in Central Asia Kazakhstan is interested in signing  as soon aspossible  a treaty creating a nuclear-weapon-free zonein the region. Such a zone could be an importantcontribution by regional States to the disarmament andarms control efforts of international community.Further  additional results-oriented efforts toprevent the excessive accumulation of and illegaltrafficking in small arms are no less important. It isimpossible to ignore the alarming fact that 55 per centof known small arms stocks  equivalent to 305 millionpieces  are now already in private hands. In view of theneed for targeted actions in this area  we express ourwillingness to host in Kazakhstan  in 2003  aninternational conference on this subject under theauspices of the United Nations.Our country  home to the Baikonur spacelaunching pad  is well aware of the harmful effects ofthe militarization of outer space. Therefore  we believethat it is imperative to start  without delay  talks toprevent an arms race in outer space.From the very start  Kazakhstan has resolutelyand unconditionally supported counter-terrorist actionsby the international coalition. Without any doubt  itseffective measures have contributed to the settlementof the situation in Afghanistan.Together with all interested States and parties our country supports the key role of the United Nationsin the post-conflict peace-building in Afghanistan. Weintend to take a most active part in implementing aninternational aid programme for Afghanistan.Kazakhstan is cooperating successfully with the WorldFood Programme by using it to send its agriculturalproducts to Afghanistan. Our country has provided theAfghan people with free humanitarian aid in the formof grain. We believe that early implementation of thedecisions adopted at the Tokyo Conference willcontribute to the successful solution of the Afghanproblem and to the eradication of internationalterrorism.When we speak about Afghanistan  we cannotignore the issue of drug trafficking. Unfortunately  thatlong-suffering country continues to be a main source ofthe proliferation of drugs that are being transportedthrough the territories of the Central Asian States andsold on the world markets  first of all in Europe. Thisproblem is getting more and more dangerous andrequires urgent and effective measures by thecommunity of nations. We hope that the coordinatingrole of the United Nations International Drug ControlProgramme will be strengthened. One has to realizethat it is the drug trafficking that constitutes a financialbasis of international terrorism. When we put up a justfight against that evil  we  unfortunately  fight itsmanifestations and do not pay due attention to the rootcause of the phenomenon. If this state of affairsremains unchanged  curbing international terrorismwill turn into an indefinite process that will exhaust allfinancial and political resources of the community ofnations.The world community is closely watching thedevelopment of the situation in the Middle East.Interested States quite justifiably express their concernover the deteriorating chances of a peaceful settlement.We support the need to convene as soon as possible aninternational conference on the Middle East settlementin order to take parallel steps: to strengthen Israel'ssecurity  to strengthen Palestinian economic andpolitical institutions and to settle the details of the finalpeace agreement. The international community also hasto intensify its efforts to curb terrorism and meet thehumanitarian needs of the Palestinian people.Since the first days of its independence Kazakhstan has focussed its foreign affairs efforts onthe creation of a security system in Asia. That goal wasadvanced by the first summit meeting of theConference on Interaction and Confidence-BuildingMeasures in Asia (CICA)  convened in June of thisyear in Almaty. For the first time ever  the heads of themajor Asian States came together to express theirpolitical will and interest in a joint search for ways tostrengthen peace and stability in the Asian region.The adoption at the summit meeting of the finaldocuments  the Almaty Act on the institutionalizationof the CICA and the Declaration on EliminatingTerrorism and Promoting Dialogue among10Civilizations  has had an extraordinary significance.For the first time ever  the Asian continent has adopteddocuments making a significant contribution toregional and global security. Expressing ourappreciation to the CICA member States for theirefficient work at the summit meeting  we call on allinterested States to continue their work to implementconfidence-building measures in Asia.We in Kazakhstan believe that the ShanghaiCooperation Organization can become an effective toolin ensuring security and stability in the region. Themain mission of that organization is to address jointlythe problems of security  as well as to create effectivemechanisms for trade  economic and humanitariancooperation.The Johannesburg Summit fully highlighted theimportant need to overcome the antagonisms of moderneconomic and political development. It has becomeevident that with increasing globalization  thecommunity of nations will have to pay close attentionto the search for ways to ensure a more harmoniousdivision of profits and benefits between the rich andpoor among mankind. Addressing the forum in SouthAfrica  the President of Kazakhstan  Mr. NursultanNazarbaev  rightly observed that without the naturaland human resources of the developing countries therich States would have never become rich.It is commonly recognized that sustainabledevelopment is the only way to ensure the survival ofmankind. Therefore  Kazakhstan supports targeted andcoordinated efforts by the international community tosolve burning economic  social and environmentalproblems of the Central Asian region. We attach greatsignificance to cooperation with the United Nations inwater resources management  rehabilitation of theenvironmental disaster areas in the Semipalatinskregion and the Aral Sea  the preservation ofbiodiversity and the prevention of soil degradation anddesertification. At the same time  Kazakhstan has everyright to expect more effective actions in this field onthe part of the United Nations. Unfortunately  ourcountry  as well as other regional States  have yet toreceive assistance that would speed up the solution ofthe environmental problems.Kazakhstan is interested in strengthening fruitfulcooperation with the United Nations to improveregional transportation infrastructure  including withinthe United Nations Special Programme for theEconomies of Central Asia (SPECA).Kazakhstan is actively cooperating with itsEurasian Economic Community partners and considersthat integration organization to be a very promisingstructure in terms of creating a common economicspace for an extensive stretch of the Eurasiancontinent.Our country stands for a more effective EconomicCooperation Organization (ECO) and for making itsactivities more goal-oriented. We express our hope thatthe upcoming Istanbul summit will become a milestonein ECO's activities.The diplomatic efforts of Kazakhstan are alsoaimed at further strengthening political cooperation trade and economic ties with the Central Asian States.We believe that a recently created new organization the Central Asian Union  has an important role to playin this regard.The legal status of the Caspian Sea is becomingan increasingly important problem within the contextof current international relations. The lack of consensusamong the five Caspian States on the legal status ofthis unique water basin seriously hampers the chancesof turning the Caspian Sea into a zone of peace andgenuine cooperation. The issues of unrestrictednavigation  the protection of biodiversity and theenvironment  as well as demilitarization  remain verymuch on the agenda. Kazakhstan has consistentlycalled for the continuation of the preparatory work fora multilateral convention based on the consensusamong the five Caspian States in order to developsecure legal safeguards providing for long-term andstable cooperation and for creating favourableconditions for attracting investments to develop themineral resources of the Caspian Sea.In this regard  Kazakhstan attaches greatsignificance to an agreement with Russia on thedelimitation of the seabed in the northern part of theCaspian Sea in order to ensure the rights of the users ofthe seabed subsoil  as well as to the protocol on themodified median line in this part of the sea signed inJune of this year.We believe that the signing of these documentsrepresents a breakthrough in the protracted process ofthe development of the legal status of the Caspian Sea.These important agreements give the green light toforeign investments in the development of theenormous mineral resources of Kazakhstan's sector ofthe sea. This will allow our country to join the group ofleading world producers of hydrocarbons. We intend tocontinue our cooperation with international financialinstitutions and companies  thereby ensuring afavourable investment climate in Kazakhstan.Kazakhstan has assumed obligations with regardto the observation and protection of fundamentalhuman rights and freedoms. Our country is aparticipant in major international human rightsconventions and exerts every effort to implement them.Democracy and human rights are part and parcelof political life in Kazakhstan  which has undertaken in complex geopolitical conditions  reforms aimed atthe liberalization of the economy and at the creation ofa civil society. These reforms are unprecedented for apost-Soviet State.The question of human rights  in the view of ourcountry  should be on the agenda of inter-Statecooperation. At the same time  we believe that unifiedstandards and criteria should be used in assessing thehuman rights situation in a particular country. Webelieve that the prerogative and responsibility for theconsideration of the state of affairs in this verysensitive area should rest with the United Nations. Weare pinning great hopes on the activities of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights.In an increasingly interdependent world  there isno alternative to multilateral cooperation. Only jointlycan we work successfully for a world without wars andconflicts  a world based on justice and prosperity.We have embraced with great enthusiasm thestatement made by the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  and express our support for his concept ofjoining efforts in order to address the key issues ofmodern times."
"89",3703,"KEN",57,2002,"﻿Allow me to extend toMr. Kavan  on behalf of my delegation  sincerecongratulations on his election as the President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh regular session.May I also thank his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  whose tenure of office coincided with one of themost trying periods in modern history following the 11September terrorist attacks in the United States. Weappreciate the excellent manner in which he handledthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. May Ialso commend the efforts  courage and vision of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who has continuedto be a beacon of strength and hope. We salute him. Inaddition  we also wish to welcome Switzerland to theUnited Nations and look forward to the admission ofEast Timor.Coming from a continent plagued with manyobstacles  we believe that the fifty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly affords us yet anotheropportunity to critically revisit the promisesenumerated in the Millennium Declaration and to takestock of progress made so far. Two years down the line we should give an account of our commitment to theDeclaration. In many instances  I am afraid  we shall befound wanting. We have not lived up to our promisesand  as a result  many in the world are more desperatetoday than they were two years ago. They had placedtheir hope in our vision  our sincerity  our commitmentand our sense of urgency and purpose.Various United Nations conferences and meetingshave been held since the 1990s to address thechallenges confronting developing countries. It istherefore regrettable that there has been insufficientpolitical will to implement the decisions arisingtherefrom. Meagre resources have been committed todebt reduction  improving market access  humanresource development and tackling the HIV/AIDSpandemic and other diseases.The current global financial framework hasdemonstrated its inadequacy in dealing with theproblems facing developing countries. The decline inofficial development assistance flows and foreigndirect investment is an issue of concern. Despite effortsmade to achieve sustained economic growth andsustainable development  conditions in theinternational arena have not been adequatelysupportive. For a start  my delegation calls for greateremphasis to be placed on concessionary lending andgreater use of grants.Moreover  global trade arrangements have tendedto benefit industrialized countries. Africa's presentshare of global trade is less than 2 per cent. Whileindustrialized countries continue to provide substantialsubsidies for their agricultural sector  developingcountries have been forced to cease similar support.This  combined with tariff and non-tariff barriers totrade  has meant that our products stand no chance ofcompeting with the products from the North. We musttherefore build on the momentum achieved at Doha aswell as encourage initiatives  such as the AfricanGrowth and Opportunity Act and the European Union/African  Caribbean and Pacific Group of States tradearrangements  to enable our countries take advantageof the opportunities in international trade.Many developing countries  including Kenya  areexperiencing a net outflow of resources  mainly due todebt service obligations. As a result  there are fewerresources targeted towards basic social services  thuscompounding the poverty situation. We therefore call26for an overhaul of the Heavily Indebted Poor CountriesDebt Initiative eligibility criteria so that countriesfacing high levels of poverty and debt burden qualifyfor debt relief.The launching of the African Union and the NewPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) haverekindled great hopes in the African continent. Theseinitiatives have made it clear that the primaryresponsibility for the development of Africa lies in thehands of the Africans themselves. The decision by theUnited Nations General Assembly to hold a high-levelplenary meeting on NEPAD on 16 September 2002recognizes the importance of that initiative  whichemphasizes the twin principles of ownership andpartnership.Kenya calls for genuine partnership in theimplementation of resolutions  commitments and especially  the Millennium Development Goals  theMonterrey Consensus and the Outcome of the justconcluded World Summit on Sustainable Development.The special session of the General Assembly onchildren  held in May 2002  provided the internationalcommunity with an opportunity to renew itscommitment to the rights-based approach to children'sprogrammes and activities. The Government of Kenyahas made continued efforts to improve the welfare ofchildren. Kenya has ratified the Convention on theRights of the Child and has signed the OptionalProtocol on the sale of children  child prostitution andchild pornography. Kenya has also ratified instrumentsprohibiting the involvement of children in armedconflict. A comprehensive Children's Statute wasenacted in parliament and became operational on 1March 2002. Kenya also has in place an earlychildhood development policy  safeguarding childrenfrom birth until the age of six.My delegation notes with concern that thereduction in funding to the United Nations PopulationFund (UNFPA) by a major contributor will have anegative impact on ongoing programmes in manydeveloping countries. The UNFPA continues to playa critical role in assisting the most vulnerable insociety — namely  women and adolescents. It is ourhope that voluntary contributions to the organizationwill be restored to their former level and furtherincreased as a matter of urgency.With regard to the United Nations Centre inNairobi  my delegation welcomes the improvement inthe level of utilization of the conference facilities. Weencourage the Secretary-General to take the necessarymeasures to ensure that all meetings and activities onenvironment and matters related to human settlementsare held at the United Nations Office at Nairobi(UNON) so as to utilize the excellent facilities thereand to further strengthen the role of the Organization inall matters charged to it in conformity with theheadquarters rule.My delegation would like to commend the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly for elevating theCommission on Human Settlements to a fully fledgedprogramme now known as the Governing Council ofthe United Nations Human Settlements Programme(UN-Habitat)  and the United Nations Centre forHuman Settlements (Habitat) to be its secretariat. Wehave no doubt that the upgrading will facilitate theimplementation of the Habitat Agenda and theDeclaration on Cities and Other Human Settlements inthe New Millennium.The Secretary-General's programme budget forthe biennium 2002-2003 shows that the activitiesundertaken by the United Nations EnvironmentProgramme (UNEP) and UN-Habitat continue todepend heavily on extrabudgetary resources. This hasseverely constrained the ability of both organizations toplay their roles effectively due to an unpredictablefinancial resource base and under-provision. We urgethe Secretary-General to ensure stability andpredictability in funding UNEP and UN-Habitatthrough the United Nations regular budget.My delegation would like to congratulate thenewly appointed High Commissioner for HumanRights  His Excellency Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. Wewould like to assure him of our full cooperation  andwe look forward to working very closely with him. Atthe same time  we wish to pay tribute to the outgoingHigh Commissioner  Her Excellency Mrs. MaryRobinson  for her able leadership.Kenya wishes to underscore the importance oftreating human rights issues in a balanced manner. Thisvery Assembly has consistently reaffirmed:“that all human rights are universal  indivisible interdependent and interrelated and that theinternational community must treat human rightsglobally in a fair and equal manner  on the same27footing and with the same emphasis”. (resolution56/165  seventh preambular paragraph)I am afraid that this has not always been so.There is a genuine concern that too muchemphasis has been given to political rights at theexpense of economic and social rights  such as the rightto development. These are vital issues that theinternational community can no longer afford to takelightly as it endeavours to eliminate hunger andpoverty and ensure a just standard of living for allpeople.Kenya holds the view that the General Assemblyshould play a leading role in spearheading developmentinitiatives  as envisaged in the Charter. We welcomethe progress already made in the reorganization andrevitalization of the General Assembly. This organshould now reclaim its leadership role in focusing andshaping debate on issues of global interest.On issues of world security  Kenya has a longrecord of participation in peacekeeping operations.Today  Kenya is the sixth largest troop contributor toUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in differentparts of the world. We are particularly happy to beassociated with the success of United Nationspeacekeeping operations in East Timor  Sierra Leone and on the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea.Greater emphasis should be put on thedeployment of adequate force levels to missions inAfrica. In particular  we would like to see greatersupport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Africa is a continent ravaged by conflicts andinstability. However  the recent progress in theresolution of some of these conflicts is veryencouraging. In particular  the signing of a protocolbetween the Government of the Sudan and the SudanPeople's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) inMachakos  Kenya on 20 July 2002 was a very welcomedevelopment. Other positive developments towardslasting peace in Africa include the signing of anagreement between the Democratic Republic of Congoand the Rwandese Republic  the holding of peacefulelections in Sierra Leone after years of bitter civil war and continuing efforts towards reconciliation of thewarring factions in Somalia. We also welcome therecent positive developments in Angola. Kenya willcontinue with its mediation efforts in the region and inthe continent as a whole.On the important question of reform of theSecurity Council  Kenya calls for the speedyconclusion of negotiations aimed at equitablerepresentation and an increase in membership in theSecurity Council. With the establishment of the Peaceand Security Council as an important organ of the newAfrican Union  Africa must now play its rightful role inmatters of international peace and security. It is timeAfrica was accorded the elevated status it deserves inthe Security Council.Kenya believes in the rule of law and will supportall genuine efforts to this end. We subscribe to peacefulsettlement of disputes through regional efforts  theInternational Tribunals and the International Court ofJustice. Kenya fully supports the historic milestone ofthe adoption of the Rome Statute in 1998 and its entryinto force on 1 July 2002. Impunity for serious warcrimes is indeed a denial of justice  which must bebrought to an end.In 2001  we witnessed the most devastating formof international terrorism in the multiple terroristattacks of 11 September. As a country that faced asimilar attack in 1998  Kenya strongly believes thatterrorism can never be justified under anycircumstances. We fully support the implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and havealready ratified the 12 anti-terrorism conventions. Theprocess of domesticating them is already under way.In conclusion  Kenya looks forward to greatercommitment to build a secure and more prosperousworld for all. The destiny of mankind is inextricablyintertwined in spite of national boundaries. Events inthe global arena have clearly demonstrated that theeffects of ignorance  poverty  disease and insecurity inone region or another country can impact negatively onthe well-being of the rest of the world. Let us gettogether and build a world where all can live in peaceand prosperity."
"90",3727,"KGZ",57,2002,"﻿Allow me at the outset to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the lofty post of President of thisrepresentative world forum and to wish you everysuccess in your work. Your election as President of thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly issymbolic not only of the personal respect you hold  butalso of the authority your country enjoys in the worldcommunity. In recent decades  the Czech Republic hasbeen through some hard times. Because of that  youwell understand the problems of Kyrgyzstan  which isgoing through a transition from its authoritarian past toa democratic future.I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Han Seung-soo for his excellent work as the President of theprevious session. The present session is significant inthat the Swiss Confederation and  soon  the DemocraticRepublic of East Timor will have become Members ofthe United Nations. We warmly welcome therepresentatives of those countries  who areparticipating in this session of the General Assembly.This is my first address from the rostrum of theGeneral Assembly as President of the sovereignKyrgyz Republic. 11 years have passed since the Stateof Kyrgyzstan declared its independence. What hasbrought me to the Assembly is my desire to share withyou my thoughts on the most pressing problems of ournational development.First  I would like to refer to the InternationalYear of Mountains  which is being celebrated this yearpursuant to a resolution adopted at the fifty-thirdsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations.It was proclaimed at the initiative of Kyrgyzstan andother mountainous countries  for which the problem of7the development of mountainous areas is of crucialimportance. We are very grateful for the support givento that initiative. Thanks to the efforts of the UnitedNations  important events have already taken place atthe regional and national levels. The outcome of thework done will be discussed at the Global MountainSummit  to be held in our capital  Bishkek  at the endof October. We will create the most favourableconditions for its work  in the best tradition of Kyrgyzwarmth and hospitality.I believe the delegates present in the Hall willagree that among the many complex challenges facingthe world community  the most pressing problems aredeveloping democracy and guaranteeing human rightsand freedoms. Those goals have been made a toppriority in the Kyrgyz Republic since the earliest daysof its establishment.We are convinced that in modern day conditions unless there is consistent democratization and humanemancipation  progress and prosperity cannot beachieved. However  the remnants of the authoritarianSoviet heritage still has a tenacious hold on the mindsof our people  especially among the elderly. There isgood reason why former Soviet States are referred to ininternational classifications as transitional countries.Our experience has shown that the process of transitionis particularly difficult not only in the area of theeconomy but in the minds of people.On our road towards democracy  we haveexperienced both joyful success and bitter failure.When we analysed our failures  we came to understandthat their main cause was a lack of democracy. In orderto give the development of democracy a new andpowerful impetus  I as President proclaimed a newnational idea: Kyrgyzstan  a country of human rights.We intend to elaborate a democratic code and toestablish a council for democratic security. Recently  inorder to further the process of democratization  I tookthe decision to reform our Constitution and to convenea Constitutional Assembly. During my stay in theUnited States  the Constitutional Assembly is at theconcluding stage of its work. The difficulty is thatsociety has different approaches for developingdemocracy. Some forces claiming to be ardentsupporters of democracy consider the essence ofdemocracy to be the destruction of existing structuresand the undertaking of new experiments. That wouldcause the transition from authoritarianism todemocracy to take a very long time  indeed  whilepeople have long awaited stability. On behalf of thepeople of Kyrgyzstan  I would like to assure the worldcommunity that we adhere to the principles ofdemocracy and will confidently follow that pathdespite the difficulties and obstacles that we encounter.I consider the problem of poverty eradication tobe as important as the problem of the development ofdemocracy. The problem has worsened under presentconditions in the post-Soviet period. We are not theonly poor country in the world. There are many reasonsfor this  and I do not intend to analyse them in mystatement. Poverty has a negative impact on people'smorale and creates many obstacles to developing thedemocratic process. Moreover  poverty is a breedingground for extremism and international terrorism.The world community has repeatedly declared itsresolve to help countries in need to overcome poverty.Mr. George Bush  the President of the United States promised to substantially increase assistance to poorcountries when he announced the creation of theMillennium Challenge Account. We are grateful forevery initiative of the United Nations  the UnitedNations Development Programme and otherinternational organizations  as well as of donorcountries  for their assistance to poor countries.However  those efforts are still not sufficient.Following the example of my colleagues fromother poor countries  I would like to call upon theworld community not to slacken its efforts in thecampaign against poverty and to find new resourcesand new approaches in solving this problem. Thatwould help reduce pockets of instability  encourage thedevelopment of democracy and have a positive impacton the world's development as a whole.I would like to refer to the problem ofinternational terrorism  which is the main danger to theworld. New York  where the Assembly is nowgathered  was witness to a terrible tragedy whichshowed the horrendous  brute face of terrorism. TheKyrgyz Republic  which in past years experiencedincursions into its territory by international terroristgroups  has strongly supported the call of the Presidentof the United States of America  Mr. George Bush  tocreate an anti-terrorism coalition. Together with Russiaand our other partners and allies  Kyrgyzstan joined thecampaign against the horrendous  bestial face ofterrorism. We very much appreciate the work of theCounter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council 8and I assure you that Kyrgyzstan will extend allpossible assistance to the Committee in its work.At the global  regional and national levels Kyrgyzstan is actively participating in the struggleagainst international terrorism. We have put ourterritory at the disposition of the military forces of theanti-terrorism coalition. In December of last year  ourcapital  Bishkek  hosted an international conferenceunder the auspices of the United Nations and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe tostrengthen comprehensive efforts to fight internationalterrorism. A Declaration and Programme of Actionadopted at that time established a firm foundation foraction at the global level.Anti-terrorism centres have been establishedwithin the framework of the Shanghai Organization ofCooperation and the Commonwealth of IndependentStates. Within the framework of the Collective SecurityTreaty  Collective Rapid Deployment Forces have beenestablished with headquarters in Bishkek.However  there are still many unresolved issuesconfronting the anti-terrorist coalition in Afghanistan where  until recently  the main redoubt of internationalterrorism was located. On 23 September I will bemeeting with President George Bush in the WhiteHouse. I believe that the question of our cooperation inthe struggle against terrorism will be a top priority. Iintend to assure the President of the United States thatKyrgyzstan  acting together with Russia and our otherpartners  will discharge its responsibility.One of the most important points of my statementto the General Assembly is to draw the Assembly'sattention to a major event in the Kyrgyz Republic. I amreferring to the fact that  next year  in 2003  our peoplewill be celebrating the 2 200th anniversary of KyrgyzStatehood. Taking into account the wishes of widesegments of our society  I  as President  issued an edictproclaiming 2003 the year of Kyrgyz Statehood.For the newly independent States that emergedfrom the collapse of the Soviet Union  a search for ourhistoric and ethnic roots has become a vital task. I amsure that  at the dawn of their independence  manyStates that are now represented in the United Nationsexperienced the same desire. Research carried out byour historians and a study of the works of well-knownorientalists have led us to the conclusion the formationof the first Kyrgyz State took place at the end of thethird century B. C. This has been convincingly borneout by ancient Chinese chronicles. The famous Chinesechronicler Sima Qian  who is considered to be theChinese Herodotus  drew up a chronicle in verse aboutthe existence in far-off times of a Kyrgyz State in theform of a Kyrgyz princedom. That State flourished atcertain periods and at others merely smouldered. Butnational Statehood was carried forward by the Kyrgyzpeople for many centuries up to the end of thetwentieth century  when it took the form of the KyrgyzRepublic  which later became a Member of the UnitedNations.I would like to remind the Assembly that  in1995  the Kyrgyz people celebrated a great event namely  the one thousandth anniversary of our greatwork of folk literature  the heroic epic Manas. We arevery grateful to the United Nations for the decision ittook at the time to give that event internationalresonance. The celebration in Kyrgyzstan of the onethousandth anniversary of the Manas epic took placewith great enthusiasm. That contributed to anunprecedented revival of national spirit and to the unityof our people.From this rostrum  I wish to address theSecretary-General Kofi Annan and all the delegationsparticipating in the work of the current session to askthem to adopt a decision to recognize as a great historicevent in the life our country the 2 200th anniversary ofKyrgyz Statehood  and to give it international status.That would be accepted by my people with profoundgratitude. It would also do much to promote domesticstability and further consolidate the multi-ethnic natureof my nation. In cooperation with other delegations my delegation will submit an appropriate draftresolution on this subject that I  as President ofKyrgyzstan  would ask the Assembly to support.Kyrgyzstan's cooperation with the United Nationsis multilateral in nature. It encompasses a widespectrum of problems of interest to us all. We havereceived unwavering support and assistance from theUnited Nations and its specialized agencies at everystage of our development since the proclamation ofState independence. I should like to take thisopportunity to express our sincere gratitude for thatassistance. I also wish to proclaim from this rostrumthat Kyrgyzstan will in the future remain firmlycommitted to the purposes and principles of the9Organization  and that we will do whatever we can tomake them a reality."
"91",3770,"KHM",57,2002,"﻿I should like at the outset to join otherspeakers in congratulating you  Sir  on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. We are fully confident that  under yourable leadership  the work of the General Assembly willfurther advance the cause of international cooperationin the interests of humankind.I would also like to take this opportunity towelcome the Swiss Confederation  which has becomethe one hundred and ninetieth Member of our worldOrganization. I am also pleased to extend a warmwelcome to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste which will soon be joining our global Organization.I believe that we are living in a fragile and fast-changing world  a world of uncertainties andturbulence that has been seriously threatened byterrorism  the negative aspects of globalization  therising effects of global warming and the impact ofclimate change. The effects of these rising forcesunderline our common vulnerability and recall theurgent need for more effective sustainable developmentin the world  without which the survival of humanitymay be jeopardized. I therefore believe that thecommon challenge we face today is perhaps the lack ofcollective wisdom and political will to make our worlda better place for all  including future generations.The recent World Summit on SustainableDevelopment in Johannesburg rightly discussed thefundamental issues confronting humanity: climatechange  global sustainable development and poverty.The dramatic appeal made by many leaders of theworld at that Summit must be taken very seriously asan important message about the need to save the Earthfrom destruction and to reverse the global trends ofwidening development gaps  increasing poverty andenvironmental destruction.With respect to the environment  I believe thathumanity as a whole is now confronting severe globalwarming  unprecedented flooding and the increasinglydisastrous effects of greenhouse gases. This is nolonger just a scientific theory  but a living reality. Forthe first time this year  we have experienced mega-floods and serious droughts across continents — fromAsia to Europe  from Africa to South America — thathave wrought immense destruction and cost billions ofdollars. We must seek to reverse these negative trendsfor the survival of humanity. In this regard  I think thatwe should all welcome and strongly support the boldmessage of the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  the ultimate goal of which was to ensurethe survival of humanity and to fight poverty andenvironmental destruction.I also wish to recall the 2000 MillenniumDeclaration  which centred on fighting poverty combating HIV/AIDS  ensuring sustainabledevelopment and forging a common partnership fordevelopment. In the same vein  the United NationsInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  held in March in Monterrey  Mexico called on the developed countries to provide greaterassistance to the least developed. Without adequateresources  it will be difficult for the least developedcountries to break out of the vicious cycle of povertyand to catch up with the current process ofglobalization. I believe that this is a question not ofgenerosity  but of human dignity and of sharing thewealth of the world in which we all live in the mostequitable way.(spoke in English)As the world continues to be shaped by the forcesof globalization  we are witnessing growing disparitiesand development gaps between the haves and have-nots. As a double-edged sword  globalization couldeither help to propel humanity as a whole to greaterprosperity or further marginalize the poor. I believethat reducing poverty could contribute to some extentto the fight against terrorism and effectively managethe growth of transnational issues  such as humantrafficking and the prevalent HIV/AIDS epidemic.In this context  the Cambodian Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Samdech HunSen  has made the fight against poverty a top priorityof its strategy. In addition  human rights anddemocracy in Cambodia have been furtherstrengthened. In February this year  Cambodia for thefirst time organized free and fair local elections as partof its decentralization policy and its efforts tostrengthen grass-roots democracy. Moreover Cambodia remains committed to contributing activelytowards the realization of integration of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  so13that ASEAN may move forward in a collective spiritand play its constructive role in deepening East Asiancooperation as a whole. In this regard  the forthcomingGreater Mekong subregion and ASEAN summits inPhnom Penh in early November will be importantvenues for ASEAN leaders to further promote ASEANintegration and build closer cooperation in East Asia encompassing the 10 nations of South-East Asia China  Japan and the Republic of Korea.On regional issues that concern the wholeinternational community  I wish to raise the MiddleEast conflict first. I believe that the internationalcommunity has to help find a viable solution whichcould bring lasting peace to the region. Cambodiastrongly believes that violence in any form is not asolution. On the contrary  violence provokes moreviolence. The Palestinian people have an inalienableright to dispose of their own State  living in peace withIsrael. I think that both sides must have the wisdom tounderstand that they are condemned to living side byside forever. Therefore  it is better for both sides toremain at peace with each other than to engage inendless war.Secondly  with regard to the Iraqi situation Cambodia believes that Iraq's acceptance of the returnof United Nations weapons inspectors is an importantstep that will certainly contribute to defusing thesituation in the region.Thirdly  on the Kashmir problem  I believe thatwe need to avoid the escalation of that conflict. If notproperly managed  the Kashmir conflict could seriouslyescalate and thus threaten regional peace and securitynot only in South Asia  but also in South-East Asia. Wemust do what we can to ensure that the terrorists cannotseize the opportunity of that conflict to furthercomplicate the present situation.On a more optimistic note  I believe that therecent positive developments in the Koreanpeninsula — especially the resumption of North-Southdialogue and the historic visit of Japanese PrimeMinister Koizumi to Pyongyang — are significantmilestones towards the normalization of the situationthere.As far as the fight against terrorism is concerned Cambodia has signed and is in the process of accedingto all 12 conventions related to the combat againstterrorism. ASEAN  for its part  has been forceful anddecisive in coming up with a number of initiatives andmeasures. The ASEAN leaders  at their SeventhSummit in Brunei in November 2001  adopted theASEAN Declaration on Joint Action to CounterTerrorism. In addition  there have been a number ofagreements and specific action plans that ASEAN andthe ASEAN Regional Forum have put in place in orderto tackle the threats of terrorism in our region. In Julythis year  ASEAN and the United States signed an anti-terrorism declaration as a framework for morecooperation to prevent and combat global terrorism.Now  I wish to address the issue of reforming theUnited Nations  particularly the Security Council which I believe we should not simply ignore or take astatus quo approach to. I believe that the UnitedNations cannot continue to work in its current modusoperandi if we want to further improve this importantglobal institution and to have it truly reflect the needsand political realities of the world in the twenty-firstcentury  to which it should be adapted as soon aspossible. Any attempt to further delay United Nationsreform  in my view  will only undermine the credibilityof this universal institution.Accordingly  I wish to reiterate Cambodia's call for theexpansion of the Security Council to include other newmembers. In that regard  Cambodia would supportJapan  the Federal Republic of Germany and India asnew permanent members of the Security Council taking into account the growing political and economicroles of those countries in world affairs.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate that peace stability and poverty are all interrelated and affect allpeoples and nations of the planet. From that point ofview  it is essential that we continue to work togetherto build a caring community of nations  where thedevelopment gap between the developed and thedeveloping countries is reduced  the threat of terrorismis totally eliminated  the menace of the HIV/AIDSpandemic is curbed  poverty is alleviated and globalwarming is kept in check. That will be possible only bybuilding better cooperation and closer partnership fostering mutual respect  cultivating greater toleranceand enhancing the spirit of a real United Nations forall. I strongly believe that we can do that throughcollective will and strong determination  as well asbetter ethics and moral responsibility  which will help14us make a better world for all peoples in the twenty-first century."
"92",3815,"KNA",57,2002,"﻿Allow mefirst to salute fellow leaders  whose tireless work and26timeless commitment within and beyond the halls ofthe United Nations help shape a more secure world forour peoples. Improving the human condition is acharge to which we must remain resolutely committed.This we can achieve only through meaningfulpartnership.Last year's efforts and the promise ofcommunity-building should not be excluded from thisyear's agenda. To build community partnership iscrucial; but  more importantly  we need equity. To fulfilexpectations of a better world  and to extract the laudedbenefits of globalization  much harder work is requiredto reduce the gap between rich and poor nations andthe haves and have-nots in our societies.How can we explain the excruciating truths of aglobal marketplace where countries which aretechnologically deficient and heavily dependent onagriculture for their survival are encouraged  and evencoerced  into opening their economies and embracingfree trade  while larger and richer economiessystematically subsidize their domestic agriculturaloutput  mostly for political reasons  at a rate ofbetween 22 to 60 percent annually.Mr. President  your mandate this year — a verycritical one — will be to ensure that the peoples of theworld who suffer as a result of this inequity can trulyrenew their faith in us and believe again in the valuesof the United Nations.My delegation has said repeatedly thatglobalization is not a bad thing. However  it continuesto be managed badly. We insist that the currentstructure of the global economy is inherently flawed. Itserves to reward the powerful and to punish the weak.While we appreciate that our world is undergoingprofound and necessary changes  we cannotcountenance abandoning the principles and values thatbind us within the human family and the family ofnations.Globalization  in our view  must include trueuniversal equity in its application of sharedresponsibility and good governance. The selectiveprocesses by which the agendas of the powerful feware advanced to the exclusion of the small  poor andeconomically vulnerable States must be addressed witha willingness to correct it. My delegation believes thatthe United Nations is uniquely positioned to respond tothis challenge. Hence  my Government questionsattempts to transform certain United Nations organssuch as the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) into advisory bodies  and away fromdevelopment assistance  which poor developingcountries need now more than ever.The United Nations must evolve as a dynamic receptive and representative body to stem the tides thatthreaten us. It must build or strengthen social safetynets in many developing nations  not oversee processesgeared at dismantling them. We must recommit toimproving lives and to re-energizing our fight againstpoverty  hunger and ignorance. The United Nations hasa significant role to play in this endeavour. Improvedcoordination of United Nations agencies is critical inachieving these objectives.My delegation urges Member States to pledgetheir support  and hopes that they will  to ensure thatthe three conferences sponsored by the United Nationsthis year — the International Conference on Financingfor Development  the special session on children andthe World Summit on Sustainable Development — bearfruit. We remain hopeful that continued dialogue partnership and the instrumentality of the UnitedNations will enable us to make meaningful progress.A year has passed since the barbaric acts of11 September. The foundations of our world viewshave changed dramatically  as has the way we look atourselves and at our commitment to personal  nationaland international security. Again  Saint Kitts and Nevisunreservedly denounces any act of terrorism  anywherein the world. We do not believe that the indiscriminatekilling of innocent people as an expression of despairor oppression is an acceptable means of redress. Wevalue highly the sanctity of life  and my Government iscommitted to its protection. We will work together inthe United Nations to find international solutions toaddress this outrage. Let us ensure that the continuingwar against terrorism is waged within the structures ofinternational institutions such as the United Nations.Year after year  we call on the internationalcommunity to join our noble campaign to halt thetrans-shipment of nuclear wastes through ourCaribbean region  but this call goes unheeded. Ireiterate our appeal today. Saint Kitts and Nevis urgessustained follow-up action to give meaning and life tothe United Nations resolution adopted in 2000declaring the Caribbean Sea a special area in thecontext of sustainable development.27Representation is crucial to the peoples of theworld  and  as my delegation has done in the past  Iwish to re-emphasize the status of the people of theRepublic of China on Taiwan. Membership in thisOrganization is in itself a validation and celebration ofa people's fundamental human rights. We thereforelament the continued stalemate that results in theexclusion of the people of the Republic of China onTaiwan from the United Nations family.The contribution of the 23 million people of theRepublic of China on Taiwan to the global market  tothe international community in the areas of technology technical assistance and development assistance isunmistakably significant. Its participation ininternational activities can rival  and in many instancessurpasses  that of many developed countries who arefull Members of the United Nations. It is unfortunateand most regrettable  therefore  that the United Nationshas been unable to create a meaningful and practicalformula that would allow the Chinese people on bothsides of the Taiwan Straits to resolve this impasse which stymies the genuine hopes and desires ofmillions of people who adhere to the principles of theUnited Nations Charter and whose nation is a modelinternational citizen.We have witnessed how involvement by theinternational community can facilitate positivedevelopments  such as the emergence of nationhood.On behalf of my Government and in my own name  Iwelcome East Timor to the United Nations family. Isalute it and its great leaders and pledge myGovernment's support in working with it in the yearsahead on issues of mutual interest and  of course  ofinterest to the international fraternity of nations. I alsoextend a hand of welcome and friendship to theGovernment and the people of Switzerland. It hasobserved the United Nations for many years  so it is nostranger to its proceedings. The Organization willbenefit greatly from its participation  and Saint Kittsand Nevis looks forward to collaborating with it in thefuture.The incidence of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbeanregion is a real and growing threat to our security at anumber of levels. In human terms  it threatens todevastate families and to create a generation oforphans. At the economic level  it places a tremendousburden on the health resources of our countries and hasalready begun to undermine the economicinfrastructure of our countries. The most productiveand able-bodied are at risk  and those infected with thedisease are less and less able to contribute to theeconomic activity and growth of their countries.Instead  they require medical and financial support.Resources earmarked for other areas have to beredeployed to address the new pandemic.It is clear that pharmaceutical companies andGovernments that support them can do much more toreduce the cost of antiretroviral drugs. Private-sectorcompanies must also do more to assist employees andfamilies suffering from HIV/AIDS. It is regrettable thatthe $10 billion in resources required by the GlobalFund to Fight HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria areyet to be realized.Saint Kitts and Nevis repeats its call for newparadigms to redress the inequities of globalization. Weurge the international community to developappropriate frameworks to promote fundamentalfreedoms as a comprehensive whole  not only in termsof political rights  such as the right to self-expressionand the right to vote  but also the human right toeconomic development. Only when we respond to thegenuine needs of humankind — only when the hungryare fed  the vulnerable made strong  the weak dispossessed  disenfranchised and oppressedempowered and made to feel a sense of belonging  andwhen they are free to participate fully in issues relatingto their future — can we have a world where anarchy terrorism  inter-State conflicts and war recede.What we ask for is certainly attainable. Wesimply call on the United Nations to facilitate systemswhere partnership  collective responsibility and respectfor each other are allowed to flourish. This is possibleonce States realize that national policies in a globaleconomy have international consequences. Politics maystill be local  but when we take action locally we mustremember that we are also global citizens. Thus  aprincipal goal of globalization should be to level theplaying field to provide equal opportunity. Strategies as a consequence  should reflect confidence-buildingmeasures for free trade and sustainable development.In conclusion  let me say that the United Nationshas stood firm for peace  prosperity and security for allpeoples. It has done much to ensure peace and justicethroughout the world  consistent with the principles ofinternational law. It has set itself lofty goals for thismillennium: basic education for all  eradicatingpoverty  reducing HIV/AIDS  and ensuring sustainable28development for all. Our people and  indeed  allcitizens of the global community pray that the politicalwill will be found to translate those lofty goals intoreality on the ground. Positive action  rather thaneloquent speech  must become the defining quality ofthe United Nations in the third millennium."
"93",3841,"KOR",57,2002,"﻿Thetragic events of 11 September 2001 awakened theinternational community to the gravity of a newmenace to world peace and security. The lighting of theeternal flame during the commemorative service inBattery Park was mirrored by the outpouring ofsympathy from around the globe and the world becameone again  reaching out to those who lost their lovedones on that fateful day.The global community responded promptly anddecisively to the scourge of terrorism. Over the pastyear  international cooperation has been strengthenedin our relentless campaign against terrorism. TheSecurity Council  in particular  has played acommendable role in this process through its Counter-Terrorism Committee. The Republic of Korea has beenan active member of the international coalition againstterrorism. We are now working with other countries tocontribute to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan.As we conduct our resolute fight againstterrorism  we should also consider that deprivation lack of good governance and marginalization from theprocess of globalization can serve as a breeding groundfor fanatics who can go so far as to take their own livesjust to harm others. The international communityshould  therefore  take a holistic approach  whilebearing in mind at all times that terrorism cannot bejustified by any cause or under any circumstanceswhatsoever.The events of 11 September have also broughthome to the world the appalling dangers of weapons ofmass destruction falling into the wrong hands.Moreover  the prevailing international realityunderscores the urgent need to make progress indisarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of massdestruction.It is essential that we achieve universality of non-proliferation regimes  including the Treaty on theNon-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the ChemicalWeapons Convention and the Biological WeaponsConvention  while ensuring full compliance by all18States parties to such regimes. We also hope that a totalban on nuclear testing and fissile material productionwill be achieved through the early entry into force ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and anexpeditious conclusion of a fissile material cut-offtreaty. In that regard  I would like to underline theRepublic of Korea's full commitment to strengtheningmultilateral collaboration to promote the cause ofdisarmament and non-proliferation.Since its inception  the United Nations has playeda key role in securing peace and stability in thetroubled corners of the world. Indeed  the work of theUnited Nations in conflict prevention  peacemaking peacekeeping and peace-building has expanded inrecent years.East Timor is the latest success for which theUnited Nations deserves praise. As a Member Statecommitted to the coalition of the willing  the Republicof Korea has actively taken part in the United Nationsefforts in East Timor and other parts of the world.Moreover  our overall financial contribution to UnitedNations peacekeeping operations has grownapproximately tenfold over the past three years. TheRepublic of Korea intends to strengthen itsinvolvement in these crucial United Nations activities.The Korean peninsula is still one of the world'smost volatile areas. Nevertheless  President Kim Dae-jung's unwavering pursuit of his engagement policy isfundamentally reshaping inter-Korean relations. Thatengagement policy is  in essence  a strategy for peacethrough engagement  designed to cope with themultiple challenges inherent in inter-Korean relationson the road to eventual unification. As such  it aims atfostering inter-Korean reconciliation  promotingcooperation and exchanges  reducing tension andbuilding durable peace on the peninsula.The highlight of the engagement policy was theholding of the historic summit between South Koreaand North Korea in June 2000. The summit set inmotion an inter-Korean peace process. After ups anddowns along the way  the peace process is finally backon track and moving forward again. Inter-Koreanmeetings at various levels have resumed  as haveexchanges in all areas. In fact  on this very day  atMount Kumgang  the fifth round of reunions betweenseparated family members is taking place. Next week South Korea and North Korea will hold the long-anticipated ground-breaking ceremonies marking thestart of construction work for the reconnecting ofrailways and roads that have remained severed for fivedecades. Since those projects literally involve abreakthrough in the heavily fortified border and requirea certain level of military-to-military cooperation  theywill hold not only great practical benefit but alsotremendous symbolic significance. As we look ahead tothe completion of the trans-Korean railway  this clearlypromises to have far-reaching interregionalimplications for accomplishing the vision of an ironsilk road  a rail link joining Asia and Europe.The overall progress report to date amplydemonstrates that the engagement policy works. TheKorean people on both sides of the peninsula todayenjoy a stronger peace than ever  and the risk of war isat an all-time low since the end of the Korean War  in1950. However  it is not yet time to be complacent  aswe have still a long way to go if the peace process is toprove irreversible and fully sustainable.One important challenge to the peace processrelates to the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. We continue to believe that the 1994Geneva Agreed Framework holds the best hope forremoving concerns over nuclear proliferation from theKorean peninsula. However  at the moment  the AgreedFramework has reached a critical juncture. As the lightwater reactor project progresses  it is now essential thatfull cooperation with the International Atomic EnergyAgency begin without further delay for theimplementation of the safeguards requirements of theAgreed Framework.The path to world peace runs through moreequitable economic and social development. In thatregard  we attach great importance to the UnitedNations Agenda for Development and  in particular  tothe implementation of the United Nations MillenniumDeclaration. The International Conference onFinancing for Development  held in Monterrey inMarch of this year  was a success in the area ofenhancing shared awareness of the primaryresponsibility of developing countries themselves  aswell as in emphasizing the need for more substantialinput from developed countries. The PoliticalDeclaration and Plan of Implementation adopted at therecent World Summit on Sustainable Development arealso of great significance  as they have set out a time-bound plan of action for humanity's quest to preservethe planet for posterity. The unprecedented advances ininformation and communication technologies are also19widening the gap between the front runners and thosewho lag behind. We hope that the United Nations andother relevant international organizations will becomemore proactive in bridging the digital divide betweendeveloped and developing nations.The last century witnessed the steady advanceand triumph of democracy and human rights asuniversal values around the globe. As it has been soeloquently put  liberty  when it begins to take root  is aplant of rapid growth indeed. The human rightssituation in any given country is no longer anexclusively domestic affair. The issue of human rightshas become a priority agenda item for the internationalcommunity. During the last session of the GeneralAssembly  special attention was paid to the humanrights of such vulnerable groups as children and theelderly. We sincerely hope that the pledges made at theSecond World Assembly on Ageing  as well as at thespecial session on children  will be translated intoconcrete action.The Republic of Korea has a firm commitment tointernational cooperation for the promotion ofdemocracy and human rights. We plan to host thesecond Ministerial Conference of the Community ofDemocracies in Seoul in November of this year. We areworking with other Convening Group countries toensure that this proves a momentous occasion in theprotection  consolidation and advancement ofdemocracy the world over. We also welcome therenewed commitment of the international communityto combat such growing problems of horrifictransnational crime as the trafficking in persons.Over the past half century  the United Nations hasmade outstanding contributions to causes of greatimportance to humankind. However  the world bodycannot possibly meet all expectations. Given thelimited means and resources available to it  the UnitedNations should focus on areas in which it can excel making the best use of its comprehensive mandate andthe universality of its membership. In that regard  theRepublic of Korea strongly supports the ongoingreforms that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has beenpursuing with a view to achieving a more effective andefficient United Nations.In closing  I would like to say that the UnitedNations is the embodiment of globalism and theepitome of multilateral cooperation. As such  theinternational community looks to the United Nationsfor guidance and effective action in the whole spectrumof areas under its mandate.The Republic of Korea reaffirms its firmcommitment to working in concert with other MemberStates to make the United Nations more relevant andefficient  and thus better able to meet the challengesahead  global challenges indeed."
"94",3887,"KWT",57,2002,"﻿Iam pleased to open my statement by extending warmcongratulations to you  Sir  and to your friendlycountry  the Czech Republic  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventhsession. We wish you success at the helm of thisAssembly  which is convened against a backdrop ofcomplex circumstances and daunting global challenges.Let me assure you of my delegation's full commitmentto cooperating with you in order to facilitate thefulfilment of your mandate.I wish to extend a word of thanks and tribute toyour predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his prudentand efficient stewardship of the previous session. In thesame vein  I wish to reiterate our appreciation for theoutstanding performance of Secretary-General KofiAnnan and for his tireless and concrete efforts toenhance the effectiveness of the world Organization inserving global peace  security and development.Kuwait welcomes the admission of the SwissConfederation to the membership of our Organization.We are confident that Switzerland's membership willenhance the benefits of its already active role insupporting various United Nations programmes andactivities and will further consolidate the principles andpurposes of the Charter  particularly as that country ishost to many United Nations bodies and specializedagencies.The events of 11 September 2001 in the UnitedStates  together with their consequences andimplications  have changed the global landscape andhave created a multitude of new challenges for theentire world  as we are now collectively entrenched inour fight against terrorism  violence and extremism.Experience has shown that combating this perniciousphenomenon is a universal responsibility and that noindividual country alone  irrespective of its resourcesor determination  can eliminate it.Moral and practical reasons make it unacceptableto link that curse to any particular nation  religion orculture. Such an attempt does not serve any of ourcommon goals. To the contrary  it will deepen politicaland cultural divides  exacerbate the crisis andtransform it into a conflict among civilizations thatharms us all and from which we have nothing to gain.Therefore  the United Nations remains the mostappropriate and effective mechanism for studying andanalysing that phenomenon  so as to identify its causesand parameters and to coordinate efforts with a view todeveloping guidelines for effective measures toeradicate that plague.The United Nations is also the appropriate bodyto define our responsibilities and obligations in thatregard. The signing  ratification and scrupulousenforcement by all Member States of the 12 UnitedNations instruments aimed at combating terrorism areperhaps the most viable means for establishing a solidcommon ground to combat and conquer terrorism.In that context  I wish to take this opportunity toexpress once again our condolences and sympathy tothe friendly people and Government of the UnitedStates and to the families of all the victims of thatheinous act of terrorism. We share with them theiranguish and the hope that their fortitude will help themovercome their pain and loss.In the meantime  Kuwait reaffirms itslongstanding core position condemning all acts ofterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We alsocategorically renounce all acts of violence andextremism  as they contravene not only internationalnorms and treaties but also the tolerant teachings ofIslam and its compassionate value system  as well asother religions  humanitarian concepts and civilizedvalues.12Kuwait welcomes Security Council resolution1373 (2001) within the context of Kuwait's cooperationwith the ongoing international efforts to fight terrorismand  pursuant to its provisions  has put a number ofimportant new steps and measures into effect. Theyinclude the enactment of a bill to combat moneylaundering and the adoption of practical measures toregulate fund-raising activities in order to ensure thatthose activities are not exploited or illegally used forany objective other than their legitimate and declaredintent. Furthermore  for its part  Kuwait has answeredall the queries of the United Nations Counter-TerrorismCommittee. We have provided to the Committee all theinformation and notations that clarify our national lawsand legislation enacted by the Government to combatterrorist acts and to prosecute their perpetrators.Within the same context and in order toconsolidate world efforts in combating terrorism  Iwish to reiterate Kuwait's support for the idea ofconvening an international conference under theauspices of the United Nations aimed at reaching anagreement on a clear and specific definition ofterrorism. The primary purpose of that aim is todistinguish between terrorism as a phenomenon thatendangers international peace and security and theright of peoples to legitimate struggle in resistingforeign occupation in order to attain their rights to self-determination  as set forth in the Charter and ininternational law.In this regard  Kuwait condemns the insidiouscampaign orchestrated against our sister State  theKingdom of Saudi Arabia  by certain American andWestern media sectors. For our part  however  we paytribute to the Kingdom for its valuable role andsignificant contributions to the fight against terrorismand to efforts to achieve peace and security in theregion.The success of our global efforts to eradicateterrorism depends in large measure on the ability of theinternational community to effectively address majorissues and challenges that have become a source ofdespair  misery  frustration  isolation and perceivedinjustice felt by a number of people in all parts of theworld.An elusive challenge that continues to stand out isthe constant deterioration of the situation in theoccupied Palestinian territories. The escalatingconfrontations have reached a level that threatenspeace and security in the Middle East region as awhole. The brutal practices of the Israeli occupationforces  including the unwarranted excessive use offorce against the Palestinian people  the deliberatedestruction of the institutions and infrastructure of thePalestinian Authority  in clear violation of UnitedNations resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Conventionof 1949  have resulted in exacerbating the economicand social crises sustained by the Palestinians for morethan five decades. Large-scale round-ups  housedemolitions  curfews  bombardment of civilianneighbourhoods  incursions into villages  town andcities and helicopter gunship assaults on civilians havebecome daily events for the individual Palestiniancitizen on the street. Indeed  those acts have becomeroutine stories in radio and television news.We have silently resigned ourselves to that. Itseems that the international community has beennumbed into accepting that way of life for defencelessPalestinians. But unfortunately all Israeli practicesseem to be emanating from an entrenched precept thatIsrael is immune to all accountability  exempted fromall jurisdictions and shielded from all criticism andcondemnation by the United Nations or the world'smajor Powers.Against that background  Kuwait reaffirms itscommitment to the pan-Arab position adopted at therecent Beirut Arab Summit  which endorsed theinitiative put forward by His Royal Highness PrinceAbdullah Bin Abdel Aziz  Crown Prince of SaudiArabia and Chief of the Saudi National Guard. Kuwaitremains committed to supporting the right of thePalestinian people to self-determination and to theestablishment of their independent State on theirnational territory with Jerusalem as their capital.Kuwait will continue to demand full Israeli withdrawalfrom all occupied Arab territories  including the SyrianGolan and Lebanese territory.World history and experience have amplydemonstrated that force alone  regardless of the degreeof brutality  will not bring about peace and security.The only viable option is restoring legitimate rights totheir rightful owners and implementing peace. Perhapsthe best assurance for a secure future requires long-term good-will investments in the present.Kuwait welcomed with satisfaction the decisionadopted by the most recent Arab summit  held inLebanon in March 2002  on the situation between Iraq13and Kuwait. In that decision  the Arab leaderswelcomed Iraq's pledges to respect the independence sovereignty  security and territorial integrity of theState of Kuwait and to avert any action that might leadto the recurrence of the events of 1990. Arab leadersalso demanded that Iraq cooperate in finding anexpeditious and final solution to the question ofKuwaiti prisoners and hostages and the return of stolenKuwaiti property as set forth in relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions. But  to our deep regret  thatdecision has not been implemented. The Governmentof Iraq has not as yet carried out its pledges  especiallyin regard to Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners anddetainees.That long-running humanitarian question can bearno further delay in view of its traumatic implicationsfor the families of the victims  who do not know thefate of their loved ones. The Iraqi Governmentcontinues to refuse to cooperate with the UnitedNations mechanisms established to deal with thematter. Assessing the approach followed by the IraqiGovernment  the Secretary-General concluded in thefinal paragraph of his most recent report to the SecurityCouncil pursuant to paragraph 14 of Council resolution1284 (1999)  contained in document S/2002/931 of 15August 2002  thatDespite the encouraging agreements at theArab Summit in Beirut  Iraq's words on the fateof the missing persons are yet to be matched bytangible deeds. There still is a window ofopportunity to address humanitarian issues  suchas that of missing persons  in good faith. Iraqshould use this opportunity to restore itscredibility on the outstanding humanitarianissues.' (para. 40)In that context  Kuwait welcomes the efforts andsteps undertaken by the United Nations in preparationfor the return of Kuwait's State archives from Iraqpursuant to relevant Security Council resolutions.Despite the fact that Iraq has denied over the past 11years that it had seized the archives  we consider itsacknowledgement that it holds the archives and itsintention to return them to be an important steptowards carrying out Security Council resolutions particularly resolutions 686 (1991)  687 (1991) and1284 (1999). Irrespective of Iraq's motives forreturning the archives and other Kuwaiti Statedocuments  it is our hope that this step will be followedby other positive actions leading to the release of ourprisoners and those of third countries. Only then canthis dossier be closed. I wish to stress here that thehumanitarian issue of our prisoners has dominated thenational agenda of the Government and the people ofKuwait since liberation.Regarding other relevant issues  Kuwait haswelcomed the dialogue between the United Nations andIraq  and we hope that this exercise will lead to theimplementation of the rest of the key obligations including the elimination of weapons of massdestruction and other outstanding matters.Kuwait thinks that Iraq's strict and scrupulousimplementation of all relevant Security Councilresolutions and the admission of United Nationsweapons inspectors back into Iraq would spare ourregion the horrors of a war which we do not want. Sucha war would only lead to the exacerbation of thesuffering of the brotherly people of Iraq and to theescalation of tension and instability in the region.Kuwait also welcomes the prudent approachoutlined by President George Bush of the United Statesin his statement before the General Assemblyyesterday  in which he requested the Security Councilto fulfil its legal and political responsibilities withinthe context of relevant Council resolutions regardingIraq. The Security Council undoubtedly has the powerto do so. We call upon the Security Council to performthat legitimate role. Meanwhile  we demand that Iraqfully and strictly implement all relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions in the interest of security andstability in the region and in order to avert the dangersit faces.Because of its keen interest in maintaining andbolstering security and stability in our region  the Stateof Kuwait emphasizes again its support for all effortsto resolve by peaceful means the disagreement betweenthe United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic ofIran over the disputed islands. In that context  wewelcome the mutual visits by ranking officials of bothcountries. We hope that such visits and direct contactswill help the parties to create a favourable climate forconfidence-building between the two countries.The world economic landscape has been quiteturbulent over the past year. Reports issued bynumerous specialized international institutions showthat many countries  including some developedcountries  have begun to suffer from a global economicslowdown. That in turn has led to mounting economic14and social burdens on many States due to growingimbalances and disparities between the economies ofcountries of the North and those of the South. Whilethe countries of the North continue to enjoy economicprosperity and better standards of living for theirpeoples  countries of the South continue to suffer frompoverty  famine  unemployment  environmentaldegradation  severe shortages of drinking water andwidespread pandemics such as those of HIV/AIDS andmalaria  in addition to a whole range of other problemsthat impede their efforts towards sustainabledevelopment. It is our hope that the decisions and plansof action recently adopted at the Johannesburg WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  held atJohannesburg in August and September  and at theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  held in Mexico in February  will helpbolster efforts and strengthen bonds of cooperationbetween the North and the South with a view to layingthe underpinnings of a new partnership that contributesto the stabilization and growth of economic relationsand to establishing the basis for an equitable worldtrade system that sets out the responsibilities andobligations of all sides.Perhaps one of the most pressing demands atpresent to shore up the economic structures of thedeveloping countries is that the developed nations fulfiltheir obligation to provide meaningful financial andtechnical aid to the developing world. That includesbilateral arrangements and understandings withinternational financial institutions and organizations toalleviate the debt burden of developing countries andthe cancellation of the debts of the poorest nations.Also  any tariffs or other obstacles to access for theproducts of those countries to developed countries'markets should be removed. Furthermore  developingcountries should have easier access to information andtechnologies that would help them solve their problemsand became integrated into the world economy. Suchsteps would prevent the marginalization of thedeveloping countries and least developed countries andwould help put them back on the road to development.In this regard  Kuwait draws satisfaction from thefact that it tops the list of Arab States on the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) Arabhuman development index for the current year. TheArab Human Development Report was published bythe UNDP in cooperation with the Arab Fund forEconomic and Social Development. The report drew ona whole range of indices including health  education acquisition of technical knowledge and per capitaincome. The Government of Kuwait will be guided bythe report's indicators and  in cooperation with ourNational Assembly  which is the legislative authority inour country  will maintain its efforts to improveeconomic and social conditions to the benefit ofKuwaiti citizens and their well-being.I wish to place on record our sense of pride incarrying out all our international obligations. Inparticular  Kuwait is a robust contributor to thedevelopment programmes of many developing nations.Furthermore  we are a vibrant player in ensuring astable and balanced global oil market with a view toensuring equitable and universal economicdevelopment. Also  in line with its Arab and Islamicheritage and given the imperatives of kinship  Kuwaithas never hesitated to reach out to meet its full officialand unofficial obligations towards the Palestinianpeople in the Palestinian territories and towards thepeople of Afghanistan. It is now our hope that theAfghan people  following the recent developments intheir country  will be able to live in security andstability after their long and deep suffering due to warand internal conflict. Let us hope that the country willnow channel all its resources into nationalreconstruction in order to make up for those long yearsof conflict and hostilities.Inasmuch as the peoples of the world differ intheir religion  culture and ethnicity  they are similar intheir aspirations  ambitions and hopes. We all seek tolive in freedom  dignity and safety. We all yearn for aworld in which peace  security and justice prevail.Translating that vision and hope into reality requiresaccelerating the pace of concerted global action to meetthe lofty purposes and principles defined in the Charterof the United Nations.In addition  the United Nations MillenniumSummit Declaration must be translated into a concretereality that satisfies the hopes and aspirations of thepeoples of the world. We as countries believe thatultimately we all are accountable to Allah  His name bepraised and glorified  the Creator of the universe. Weare also accountable to our peoples in terms offulfilling their legitimate aspirations in a world ofprevailing security and peace."
"95",3933,"LAO",57,2002,"﻿On behalf of the delegation of Laos  I wouldlike  Sir  to convey to you my congratulations on yourelection to the presidency of this fifty-seventh sessionof the General Assembly.The current session is taking place at a time whenMember States have entered the third year of theprocess of implementation of the Development Goalsadopted at the Millennium Summit. During the pasttwo years  satisfactory progress has been made towardsthose objectives  yet much more needs to be done. It isour view that the war on poverty deserves our greatestattention  for poverty causes millions of deaths anddoes not allow for sustainable development.Furthermore  our planet is facing the scourge ofterrorism in its various forms. Our Government willwork in a spirit of solidarity with the world communityin the combat against that scourge.Since the end of the twentieth century  it has beenwidely claimed that globalization provides tremendouseconomic and development opportunities to nations.However  it is evident that it has also broughtnumerous challenges to the majority of the world'spopulation  in particular to those people living indeveloping countries. The most notable effects ofglobalization can be seen in the fact that the disparitybetween the developed and developing countriescontinues to increase.Against this backdrop  while the developingcountries  with a sense of ownership and partnership have adopted various measures to cope with itsdisadvantages  they still find themselves confrontedwith the problem of securing financing and humanresources that can handle new technology; added tothis is the inability to access the market of thedeveloped countries. Although the InternationalConference on Financing for Development and otherinternational conferences have given rise to some hopethat these disadvantages and challenges will beaddressed  the results have been far from satisfactory.Moreover  the World Summit held inJohannesburg earlier this month failed to respond to thestrong aspirations of the developing countries and ofthe world community in addressing the issue ofsustainable development. Only by implementing thecommitments and pledges adopted at thoseinternational conferences can we ensure fair and5sustainable development and lasting peace forhumankind.We continue to seek a world of peace coexistence and cooperation for development.However  to our regret  violent disputes and conflictscontinue to rage in many parts of our planet due to thelegacies of history and other factors.We are again gathered here in the conviction thatthe United Nations  as the only truly universalOrganization  should have a greater responsibility anda more important role to play  in accordance withCharter and international law  in resolving variousdisputes in the world and in preventing the emergenceof new hot spots and interference in the internal affairsof independent and sovereign States.We should also continue to call for reform of theUnited Nations with a view to enabling it to rise to theformidable challenge of poverty eradication and thepromotion of sustainable development. In particular the Security Council should be reformed so as toensure that it fulfils its responsibilities in safeguardingpeace and security. In this context  I would like to paytribute to the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  who hasworked tirelessly to render our Organization moreeffective  and wish him even greater success in hisendeavours.The Lao People's Democratic Republic shares theinternational community's deep concern about theexcessive use of force in the Middle East since Marchthis year. In conformity with the common position ofthe Non-Aligned Movement on the Middle East peaceprocess  the Lao People's Democratic Republicbelieves that only a politically negotiated settlementacceptable to both parties and implemented underinternational supervision will bring peace  stability andcooperation to the region. Such a settlement must bebased on respect for the inalienable rights of thePalestinian people to establish an independent andviable State of their own  so that they can live side byside with Israel in peace and security withininternationally recognized borders  in accordance withall relevant United Nations resolutions.The Lao People's Democratic Republic alsoexpresses great concern about the issue of Iraq — anindependent and sovereign nation  and a State Memberof the United Nations. We are of the view that thisissue should be resolved by the United Nations throughpolitical means.With regard to the Caribbean region  the LaoPeople's Democratic Republic reiterates its call for thelifting of the economic  financial and trade embargoimposed against the Republic of Cuba by theGovernment of the United States of America. An endto this long-standing and obsolete policy would notonly mean effective compliance with various GeneralAssembly resolutions  international law and the currentworld thinking  but also promote economic prosperityand cooperation in the region as a whole.With regard to the Korean Peninsula  the LaoGovernment welcomes the recent positivedevelopments  especially the inter-Korean ministerialtalks  as well as the preparation for negotiationsbetween the Democratic People's Republic of Korea the United States of America and Japan. Thesedevelopments will help pave the way for theachievement of the goal of the peaceful nationalreunification of Korea  and significantly contribute tothe consolidation of peace and stability in East Asiaand the Asia-Pacific region.While many other countries are taking advantageof the benefits offered by globalization  the landlockeddeveloping countries are still marginalized due to theirgeographical disadvantage. Their lack of territorialaccess to the sea  and their remoteness and isolationfrom major international markets  as well as the hightransit transport costs  continue to be major obstaclesfor those countries in meeting objectives of nationaleconomic development and poverty eradication.Moreover  this geographical handicap deprives us ofour right to be competitive in the international tradingsystem and to fully benefit from it. As the countryholding the chairmanship of the Group of LandlockedDeveloping Countries  the Lao People's DemocraticRepublic expresses its appreciation to the GeneralAssembly for its decision  taken last year  to convenein 2003 an International Ministerial Meeting ofLandlocked and Transit Developing Countries andDonor Countries and International Financial andDevelopmental Institutions on Transit TransportCooperation.Over the past year  the Lao People's DemocraticRepublic has recorded a number of importantachievements in the field of socio-economicdevelopment. One event of significance was thesuccessful election of the fifth National Assembly on24 February this year. This has contributed to thegradual improvement of living standards of the Lao6people across all ethnic groups and ensured andstrengthened political stability and social order.While extending its cooperation to theinternational community in many spheres  the LaoPeople's Democratic Republic has contributed to thestrengthening of Asian solidarity and to the cause ofpeace  friendship  cooperation and development fornations throughout the world."
"96",3976,"LBN",57,2002,"﻿Itgives me pleasure to begin by congratulatingMr. Kavan on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. I wish him everysuccess as he embarks on this task. I would also like tothank his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  who so ablysteered the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session  which was convened amidst acute andgrave circumstances.I would be remiss if I failed to express myappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for histireless work to enhance the role of our internationalOrganization.It is also my pleasure to congratulate the SwissFederation on its admission to membership of ourinternational Organization.Lebanon considers the United Nations to be themain body entrusted with the realization ofinternational peace and security and with upholdingrespect for the rules of international law. The UnitedNations is a safe haven for States  particularly smallones  which find in its Charter the reassurances theyneed in a turbulent world. Therefore  any departurefrom the Charter  circumventing  disregarding  oroverstepping its authority; any selective handling of itsresolutions; or any attempt to impose settlements onand solutions to conflicts and disputes outside itsframework flagrantly undermines the credibility of theOrganization and its organs  particularly the SecurityCouncil. Such acts are a devastating blow to the pillarsof international order.Lebanon believes that there is a causalrelationship between security and sustainable27development and calls for a renewed effort  underUnited Nations auspices  to eliminate poverty anddisease  bridge the gap between the North and theSouth  and reduce social disparities. These are thescourges that are often manipulated by those whoharbour ill intentions towards humanity. In this context Lebanon welcomes the establishment of the AfricanUnion and supports the principles on which the NewPartnership for Africa's Development was built.The work of this session coincides with the firstanniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks and theterrible tragedy that struck the United States ofAmerica. The world is still suffering from their terriblerepercussions. On behalf of Lebanon  I avail myself ofthis opportunity to reiterate our sympathy with thebereaved families. Like us  they are heartbroken overthe loss of their sons  relatives and loved ones. We alsorenew our commitment to cooperating with theinternational community to combat internationalterrorism in accordance with the provisions of SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001and other relevant United Nations resolutions.The events of 11 September 2001 impeded theconvening of the ninth summit of the Francophonie scheduled to be held last year under the theme of“Dialogue among civilizations”. My country is proudto be hosting the conference in mid-October. There isno doubt that the choice of theme for the conferencebefore these dramatic events arose from the foresightof its members and participants and from theirconviction of the need to interact and to engage indialogue  far removed from the logic of confrontationand hostility.Lebanon itself was the target of terrorist actsprior to 11 September 2001 and its army stood up tothe perpetrators and overcame them. Lebanon and itsArab brothers have been suffering from the Stateterrorism continuously practised by Israel withoutinternational deterrence since the Deir Yassin massacreand the massacres in the Qana and Jenin camps.Israel has recently begun to manipulate the tragicevents of September 2001 and the internationalcampaign to combat terrorism  using them shamelesslyas a pretext for persecuting the Palestinian people anddepriving them of their right to self-determination.Israel has launched a slanderous campaign of threatsagainst Lebanon and its legitimate resistance  as wellas against Syria  while the origin of the conflict in theregion is the Israeli occupation of Arab territories.The reality is that Israel has continuously defiedresolutions of international legitimacy. Israel hasdisregarded Security Council resolution 425 (1978) formore than 22 years and has refused to implement theSecurity Council resolution calling for theestablishment of a fact-finding mission to investigatethe Jenin camp massacre. It has resorted to terror andviolence to implement expansionist and settlementpolicies. It has accumulated weapons of massdestruction in an arsenal primarily stacked withnuclear  biological and chemical weapons. It continuesto oppose all attempts to reach a just andcomprehensive peaceful solution to the Middle Eastissue  and remains  nonetheless  in total impunity never held accountable or punished for its actions. Thatsituation can only strengthen the impression amongArab Governments and peoples that there is a doublestandard at play in international affairs  and that regrettably  Israel is allowed to remain outside andabove the law.Shimon Peres today accused Hezbollah ofterrorism because it has effectively contributed to thelegitimate resistance against Israeli occupation and toforcing Israeli forces to withdraw from most occupiedLebanese territory.Hezbollah is represented in Lebanese parliamentand participates in the political  economic and sociallife of Lebanon.Mr. Peres is in fact the last person who shouldhave the right to talk about terrorism. He is the oneresponsible directly for the killing of 102 women children and elderly at Qana when Israel bombed theUNIFIL tent where they had sought safety and shelter.Israel should be held accountable for such crimes.Israel was founded on terrorism and has used it tooccupy land and establish faits accomplis.If Israel's perpetration of the massacres of DairYasin  Qana and Jenin is not terrorism  then what isterrorism?Is not Israel's daily breaking of the sound barrierover Lebanese cities and villages a form of terrorismand intimidation?28Is not Israel's kidnapping of Lebanese citizensfrom their homes and detaining them in Israeli prisonsas hostages another form of terrorism?Is not leaving hundreds of thousands oflandmines in south Lebanon to kill civilians a form ofterrorism that should be strongly condemned?Is not Israel's constant threat of invadingLebanon and destroying its civil institutions infrastructure and development projects a terrible formof terrorism  devastating to our hopes in reconstructionand rehabilitation?As if occupying Arab lands and terrorizing theircivilian populations were not enough  Israeli greedprompts Israel to usurp our natural wealth and waterresources  contravening international laws andinstruments. The Israeli Prime Minister directlythreatened to attack Lebanon  using the pretext that weare diverting the course of the Hasbani and Wazzanirivers. However  the fact is that Lebanon is trying todraw limited amounts of water for some poor southernvillages that have suffered from the Israeli occupationfor many years  which will lead us to pump a total ofapproximately 9 million cubic metres annually. By allstandards  that amount is far below our legitimaterights  it represents only one tenth of our right.Lebanon again rejects those Israeli threats anddraws the attention of the Assembly and the SecurityCouncil to the danger those threats represent and totheir direct negative impact on international peace andsecurity. It is difficult for any human society to strivefor security in the absence of political  economic andsocial justice. We  therefore  believe that securityapproaches and partial interim solutions alone cannotpossibly succeed in resolving the Middle East conflict.Therefore  we call for the adoption of an approach thattakes into account the priority of the politicaldimension of the conflict and the need to arrive at ajust and comprehensive solution to the conflict in theregion in all its aspects.In that context  Arab leaders unanimouslyadopted an integral  indivisible peace initiative at theArab Summit  held in Beirut on 28 and 29 March 2002 based on the following conditions.First  Israel must withdraw completely from theoccupied Arab territories  including the occupiedSyrian Golan  to the border of 4 June 1967  and fromthe territories it still occupies in southern Lebanon;secondly  it must reach a just solution to the problem ofthe Palestinian refugees  to be agreed upon inaccordance with General Assembly resolution 194(III); thirdly  it must agree to the establishment of anindependent and sovereign Palestinian State in thePalestinian territories occupied since 4 June 1967 in theWest Bank and the Gaza Strip  with East Jerusalem asits capital.Subsequently  the Arab States will consider theArab-Israeli conflict ended  will enter into a peaceagreement with Israel  will ensure security for all thecountries of the region and will establish normalrelations with Israel in the context of that just peace. Acentral element of the Arab peace initiative is securingan agreement not to allow any type of resettlement ofPalestinian refugees that is incompatible with theparticularities of the host Arab countries.It is unfortunate that Israel has responded to thatinitiative by increasing its aggression and reoccupyingthe West Bank  relentlessly targeting human lives andproperty in the occupied Palestinian territory.Simultaneously  others have chosen to ignore oroverride the initiative  despite its comprehensiveness unanimous acceptance by Arabs and broadinternational support.The Beirut Summit established a specialcommittee to implement the Arab peace initiative.Once formed  the committee requested a meeting withthe Quartet to present the initiative and confirm itsstatus as a point of reference for the settlement of theArab-Israeli conflict. The initiative contains allprevious references dating back to the Madrid PeaceConference  held in 1991  and is based on resolutionsof international legitimacy. We seek to submit it to theSecurity Council for adoption and for the subsequentestablishment of an international mechanism toimplement it.A meeting was held yesterday between theQuartet and a delegation of the committee at UnitedNations Headquarters. We hope that this will pave theway for a mechanism of prior consultations and jointeffort based on resolutions of international legitimacyand the Arab peace initiative.The Arab peace initiative  which we uphold andwhich was adopted unanimously by the Arab countries represents a historic opportunity that may not presentitself again. It cannot be replaced by partial or interimapproaches  the futility of which has been proven29throughout decades. Instead of leading to the long-awaited peace  they have led to renewed violence. We therefore  call upon the international community toadopt this initiative and to support it  as it represents anopportunity for achieving our aspirations — a just andcomprehensive peace in the Middle East.Submitting disputes before the United Nationsand implementing United Nations resolutions particularly those of the Security Council  canguarantee the peaceful settlement of any given conflict.By following that course  the parties could be sparedthe need to settle their dispute by military means. Itmay not be easy to contain the tragic ramifications ofmilitary action in a given region. That is particularlytrue of Iraq  which also was the subject of deliberationsat the Beirut Arab Summit. It was also decided therethat the solution to the Iraqi problem must be achievedthrough dialogue between Iraq and the United Nations.Iraq should not once again be a theatre of war  whichwould increase the suffering of its people. The Arableaders consider an attack against any Arab State athreat to the national security of all Arab countries.As president of the Arab Summit  Lebanon hopesthat Iraq's compliance with the will of the internationalcommunity and allowing the return of the internationalweapons inspectors will lead to the end of the sufferingof its people and to a comprehensive solution that willlead to the implementation of Security Councilresolutions and to the lifting of sanctions. We also hopethat that will enable the Middle East to rid itself ofweapons of mass destruction and will avert the threator use of force against Iraq  thus preserving andrespecting its sovereignty  independence and territorialintegrity.Lebanon takes pride in its strong and positiverelationship with the United Nations  being one of itsco-founders and having contributed to the drafting ofits Charter as well as to the drafting of the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights. As members may beaware  since 1978  the Organization has deployed theUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) inthe aftermath of the Israeli occupation. In May 2000 UNIFIL had the opportunity to begin fulfilling itsmandate after Israel had been forced to withdraw frommost of the territories in the south. That withdrawalwas possible thanks to our people's solidarity  theirlegitimate resistance to the Israeli occupation and thefact that our Government embraced their heroic effortsfor liberation  and the international support for theirjust cause. The Lebanese Shebaa Farms  at the foot ofMount Hermon  and other points along the withdrawalline remained under occupation.Another important aspect of UNIFIL's mandatethat has yet to be fulfilled is the restoration ofinternational peace and security. That task remainshampered by Israel's continued occupation  threatsagainst Lebanon and provocations  as seen daily in therepeated violation of Lebanon's sovereignty over itsland  airspace and territorial waters. Israel continues tooccupy the Syrian Golan and to ignore the right ofPalestinian refugees to return to their homes. It hasrejected every initiative to find a just andcomprehensive solution to the Middle East problem. Ishould like to take advantage of this opportunity tocommend the efforts of the United Nations andUNIFIL's important role as it fulfils its mandate.The liberation of Lebanese territories from Israelioccupation will remain incomplete unless we addressthe heinous legacy of occupation and succeed infinding a just solution to the problem of Palestinianrefugees  in particular those who live in Lebanon. Sucha solution should be based on their right to return andon a rejection of their settlement in Lebanon. Failure tofactor the refugees into the equation of a solution basedon the right to return and on the rejection ofresettlement in host countries would create a timebomb. It would undermine the security that we are allstriving to attain in the Middle East on the basis of apeaceful  comprehensive and just settlement of theconflict.We should like to stress here that a solution to thequestion of Palestinian refugees cannot be foundthrough exclusive bilateral Palestinian-Israelinegotiations. Guaranteed respect for the rules ofinternational law and the permanence of any solutionrequire that host and other concerned countries including Lebanon  be involved in the negotiatingprocess.With regard to mine clearance  Lebanon isstepping up its cooperation with the United Nations toassist in clearing the mines that the Israeli occupyingforces are responsible for laying in our territories. Iwill note that Israel failed to hand over complete mapsand records indicating the specific locations of thosemines.We in Lebanon attach the highest importance tothe release of Lebanese citizens who are unduly30detained in Israeli prisons. They were kidnapped byIsrael and incarcerated as hostages  in flagrant defianceof the rules and instruments of international law.It is no secret that the Israeli occupation ofsouthern Lebanon has taxed our endurance. Ourcitizens' lives have been tragically shattered  theirproperties have been destroyed  their infrastructureshave been decimated and our development has beenhampered. Increased international assistance isrequired to revitalize our economy and to increase ouropportunities for growth. Lebanon reserves the right todemand compensation for the damage caused by Israelioccupation and acts of aggression  in accordance withestablished procedures in international political andjudicial forums.The reconstruction and rehabilitation of theliberated Lebanese territories and the revitalization ofLebanon's economy are among our Government'shighest priorities. Lebanon continues to work for therecovery of its economy and for the reform of itstaxation system through the adoption of carefullydeveloped measures and legislation  including thevalue-added tax on goods and services and the gradualreduction of tariffs  in addition to the direct tax levyand the rationalization of spending. Lebanon'sparliament recently adopted the Privatization Act which regulates that aspect of economic activity anddefines its conditions and field of application. Suchlegislation  including the two recently adopted acts joins a series of laws developed to enhance investors'confidence in the free-market system  which we arekeen to preserve.Along the same lines  those in positions ofresponsibility in the Lebanese Administration aresubject to strict accountability and liability rules including money-laundering and the prohibition ofillegitimate gain. It is worth mentioning here that  overthe years  the Lebanese internal security forces havedestroyed all illegitimate crops  including hashish. ButLebanon did not receive the assistance  provided toothers  that would have enabled our farmers to live indignity.Lebanon signed a partnership agreement with theEuropean Union last June after acceding to the GreaterArab Free Trade Zone  to which most Arab Statescurrently belong. Preparations are under way for us tojoin the World Trade Organization  in which wecurrently enjoy observer status.We gather here under the roof of the UnitedNations  our common home  to engage in dialogue onthe best ways to translate into reality the great valuesof the Charter. Lebanon takes pride in its firm belief inthose values and in the fact that  in its national unity  itembodies the plurality of its society. It stands for a richhuman experience  both civilized and pioneering  ofwhich we are proud and which the internationalcommunity is surely keen to preserve.Lebanon looks forward to cooperating with otherMembers to contribute to this session's success and tofinding constructive solutions to the problems andchallenges that we face  while upholding the principlesof liberty  justice and peace around the world particularly in the Middle East region. Finding a justand comprehensive solution to the Middle East conflictin all its aspects will surely liberate our States andpeoples from the grip of a protracted problem that hasdepleted their resources and hampered theirdevelopment."
"97",4023,"LBR",57,2002,"﻿It is my pleasing duty toonce again participate in this auspicious forum onbehalf of Mr. Charles Ghankay Taylor  President of theRepublic of Liberia  and to contribute to the debate ofthis General Assembly.17At the outset  I wish to congratulate Mr. JanKavan for his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session and to assure himof the full cooperation and support of the Liberiandelegation.I also seize this opportunity to commend theoutgoing President  Mr. Han Seung-Soo of theRepublic of Korea  for the efficient and capablemanner in which he conducted the affairs of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.It is my pleasing duty to congratulate the gallantpeople of East Timor on their relentless struggle forself-determination  leading to their independence thisyear. It is also a privilege for me and my Governmentto welcome and congratulate Switzerland on itsadmission to membership of the United Nations.A year ago  the world was plunged into deepsadness as a result of gruesome acts of terrorismcommitted right here in New York City and elsewherein the United States of America. In the wake of thesebarbaric acts  we all entered a solemn collective pledgeto battle terrorism wherever it may exist. Consequently there was not only a strong condemnation of terrorism but also firm support for the campaign againstorganized terrorist networks. We wish to reaffirm oursupport for Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)and the United Nations conventions and protocolsaimed at combating terrorism. The Government ofLiberia has forwarded those conventions not yetratified to the Liberian National Legislature forratification.The consolidated and coordinated responsenecessitated by terrorist attacks requires a firmcommitment to ensuring the passage of comprehensivelegislations to meet the new dimensions of terrorism the adoption of strict financial control regulations tocurtail funding for terrorism  the strengthening ofcustoms and immigration controls  the strictenforcement of laws regulating arms traffic  and theliberalization of the extradition conditions for personssuspected of engaging in terrorism.In the global war against terrorism  we mustfurther act to combat the root causes of terrorism. Thismeans that there is a need to take concrete steps tocombat deprivation  alienation  rejection  misery andpoverty.Recent developments in the Middle Eastinvolving Israel and the Palestinians are a cause forgrave concern  requiring urgent and concrete actions tohalt violence in that region. Both the Israelis andPalestinians have justified claims  which must beresolved in a manner other than the use of excessiveviolence. Violence cannot produce peace  neither can itbe an arbiter of claims.My Government is in full support of constructiveefforts that will help both sides to return to politicaldialogue in their search for a negotiated settlement. Wetherefore urge all stakeholders and facilitators of theMiddle East peace process to undertake meaningfulactions that will reduce the current level of antagonismand violence in the region and to avoid any furtheraggravation of the situation in the Middle East. As wesay in Liberia  “Let us not use fire to put out a fire.”At the formation of the United Nations 57 yearsago  most of Africa was still under colonial rule andtherefore Africa's participation in the creation of aglobal mechanism for collective security was limited toLiberia  Ethiopia  Egypt and apartheid South Africa.Today  Africa has formed itself into the African Unionand represents over 25 per cent of the membership ofthe United Nations. Despite this fact  and consideringthat most of the conflicts under consideration by theSecurity Council are African conflicts  the continent'sparticipation in the deliberations of the SecurityCouncil is grossly limited to non-permanentrepresentation with no right of veto. In essence  Africahas no real voice in our world body even as itdeliberates on issues affecting our very existence as acontinent. This situation must change. Africa'scontribution to collective security cannot be limited toparticipation in a debate that has no binding effect ondecisions taken by the post-war Powers.Building upon the Organization of AfricanUnity's Mechanism for Conflict Prevention Management and Resolution  the African Union hasestablished a Peace and Security Council to promotepeace  security and stability in Africa  anticipate andprevent conflict  develop a common defence policy and promote and implement peace-building and post-conflict reconstruction activities. That organ willprovide the capacity for the management of Africanconflicts by Africans and will thus form the initialbasis for Africa's contribution to collective peace andsecurity.18Many African States  including Liberia  haveprovided peacekeepers to United Nations-mandatedpeacekeeping missions around the world. Africa hascome of age to contribute to international peace andsecurity  not only because Africa has the capacity to doso  but also  more importantly  because Africa is aprincipal stakeholder in international peace andsecurity. Liberia therefore calls for the permanentrepresentation of Africa on the Security Council withthe right of veto. This is the resolve of all Africans.The Government of Liberia considers the presentsanctions regime imposed on Liberia through SecurityCouncil resolutions 1343 (2001) and 1408 (2002) aspunitive and unjust. Not only are the sanctions unjust but they have also created a grave humanitarian crisisthroughout the country. Although the Government ofLiberia has always regarded as unjust  unjustified andpunitive the imposition of United Nations sanctions onthe country  it has nevertheless consistently cooperatedwith the Security Council  thus upholding that organ'sintegrity.The Government of Liberia is in full compliancewith the demands contained in paragraph 2(a) to (d) ofSecurity Council resolution 1343 (2001). Thesedemands constitute the only conditions for the liftingof the sanctions on Liberia  as provided for inparagraph 6 of resolution 1408 (2002). Essentially these demands called for the cessation of support forthe Revolutionary United Front (RUF)  intended to leadto progress in the peace process in Sierra Leone. Inorder to ensure compliance with these demands  theresolution imposed several punitive sanctions onLiberia.No one can dispute the fact that peace has beenrestored to Sierra Leone and that the RUF no longerexists. The defunct RUF has been demobilized anddisarmed by the United Nations Mission in SierraLeone (UNAMSIL). The RUF was transformed into apolitical party  the Revolutionary United Front Party(RUFP)  which contested the elections in Sierra Leoneon 14 April 2002. All Sierra Leoneans  including theRUFP  have accepted the results of the electionswithout any challenge to the democratically electedGovernment of Sierra Leone. The Government ofLiberia was represented at the inauguration of thePresident of Sierra Leone and fully recognizes theGovernment of President Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbahas the legitimate and democratically electedGovernment of Sierra Leone.Liberia is host to many Sierra Leonean refugees.The policy of the Government of Liberia has been toencourage the voluntary repatriation of all SierraLeonean refugees  in keeping with relevantinternational conventions. To this end  the Governmentof Liberia has facilitated the repatriation of SierraLeonean refugees by the Government of Sierra Leoneand the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  a process thatis ongoing.Since February of this year  12 500 SierraLeonean refugees have been repatriated to SierraLeone. Another 5 000 have registered for repatriationwith the embassy of Sierra Leone in Monrovia andUNHCR. At present  there are 25 000 Sierra Leoneanrefugees still residing in Liberia under the care ofUNHCR.How is it conceivable that Liberia can todaycontinue to be punished by the Security Council onallegations of supporting a non-existent RUF in a non-existent war in Sierra Leone  while the LiberianGovernment provides protection for thousands ofSierra Leonean refugees in Liberia?It is conceivable because of the failure todifferentiate between demands and punitive sanctions.The condition for the lifting of the sanctions  accordingto the resolution  is compliance with the demands.However  the sanctions have not been lifted becausethe focus is not on the condition precedent for itslifting  but on the sanctions themselves  as thoughpunitive sanctions were ends in themselves. It isillogical to suggest that the condition required forlifting the sanctions is the sanctions themselves. Toassert that would suggest that one would be rewardedwith a privilege if one refrained from exercising thatprivilege. It is therefore confusing to speak in terms ofalleged violations of the sanctions as though they wereindicators of compliance with the demands  when  infact  it is compliance with the specific demands of theSecurity Council resolution that constitutes the onlycondition for lifting the sanctions.In its last report on Liberia  the United NationsPanel of Experts rightfully raised the moral dilemmaregarding the continuance of sanctions against Liberiawhen the war in Sierra Leone was over. However  thatmoral dilemma was not a dilemma for those subjectingLiberia to unjust punitive sanctions  as morality had noplace in their political consideration.19If regional peace and security are the objectivesof the victimization of Liberia  how  then  do weexplain the conspiracy of silence surrounding theprevailing war in Liberia waged by externallysupported armed non-State actors? Can one reasonablyexpect peace to be consolidated in Sierra Leone ormaintained in the Mano River Union region whenaggression against Liberia is left unchecked? Whataccounts for that conspiracy? Is it due to doublestandards or to malice?The current arms embargo imposed on Liberia inthe midst of a war waged against Liberia by externallysupported armed non-State actors has caused thedisplacement of a third of the population  resulting in ahumanitarian crisis in the country. The arms embargohas encouraged the war against Liberia because of theperceived weakness of the Government to effectivelydefend its territory. Furthermore  it should be notedthat the countries providing arms and ammunition tothe non-State actors operating in Liberia are inviolation of the arms embargo  and the SecurityCouncil cannot ignore their actions.The arms embargo imposed on Liberia is aflagrant violation of Liberia's inherent right underArticle 51 of the Charter to defend itself against armedattacks. That violation has not only led to impairmentof the Government's capacity to defend the nation; ithas also contributed to the resulting humanitarian crisisthat is the cause of immense human suffering inLiberia.The combined impact of the sanctions and theongoing war in Liberia is telling on every aspect of lifein the country. The sanctions have exacerbated theproblem of a fragile economy and have imposedsuffering on an already vulnerable population.According to statistics of the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  the unemploymentrate in Liberia is estimated at 85 per cent  while 80 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.Donor assistance to United Nations specializedagencies and non-governmental organizationsoperating in Liberia has substantially declined since theimposition of sanctions.The education and health sectors have sufferedserious disruptions since the imposition of sanctions.Over 60 per cent of the children between the ages of 5and 14 years were in school in 2000  compared withabout 45 per cent today. Infant mortality and lifeexpectancy rates have significantly deteriorated. Infantmortality  which was 117 per 1 000 births in the year2000  is now estimated at over 130  while lifeexpectancy has declined from 54 to 47. Of the 16functioning hospitals and 25 health centres that wereoperating in the country in 2000  only 11 hospitals and15 health centres are still operating. At present  thereare 59 370 persons per doctor.Prior to the sanctions  over 100 000 Liberianswere engaged in artisanal mining of diamonds  eitheras operators or labourers. Taking into consideration theaverage size of the extended family  which is 7  thatbrings the number of Liberians directly or indirectlyimpacted by the Security Council ban on Liberiandiamonds to more than 700 000.A student at the University of Liberia wrote thefollowing in an assignment paper:“The United Nations euphemism ‘selectivesanctions' is a laughable oxymoron  if not a myth.The attempt to strangulate and destroy theLiberian Government can in no way provide afoolproof assurance that will guarantee theimmunity of ordinary Liberians from suchstrangulation ... To regard the sanctions asselective  one should  firstly  bury his conscienceto the plight of Liberians in their everyday living.Sanctions are not selective when Liberians aredenied income and employment opportunities  orwhen primeval darkness cannot become obsoletein the face of modernity ... It is time  high time that the United Nations abandon its destruction ofthe Liberian nation State.”I join my compatriot in calling on the SecurityCouncil to bring an end to the suffering andvictimization of Liberians by acting urgently to lift allsanctions imposed on our vulnerable country.Despite the current state of emergency andcritical conditions created as a result of United Nationssanctions and the war waged by externally supportedarmed non-State actors  the Government of Liberiaremains committed to democracy  the rule of law respect for human rights  national reconciliation andnational unity. To that end  a national reconciliationconference has been organized by a steering committeecomprised of persons representing a cross section ofLiberian society. The first national plenary of theconference was launched on 24 August 2002. Theconference was divided into five thematic subgroups:20finance and management  culture and history  goodgovernance  education and communication  andnational security.Current diplomatic initiatives undertaken to bringabout peace in Liberia are proceeding at two levels that of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates (ECOWAS) and that of Mano River Union which are parallel processes. At the ECOWAS level the objective of the process is the facilitation of a peaceprocess  especially with regard to bringing an end tothe activities of armed non-State actors  leading to anend to the ongoing war inside Liberia. At the ManoRiver Union level  the objective of the process is tobuild confidence among member States of the ManoRiver Union  the development of political will toensure good neighbourliness and the consequentimplementation of all decisions and protocols of theMano River Union  including those decisions takensubsequent to the Moroccan initiative. His Majesty theKing of Morocco  who has maintained consultationswith the United Nations and major Powers  currentlyfacilitates that process.Those parallel initiatives complement each otherand are not mutually exclusive. Settlement of theinternal conflict requires the cooperation ofneighbouring States. The destabilization of Liberia byarmed non-State actors and the resultant humanitariancrisis have been and continue to be sustained byexternal support  and no internal settlement can besustained in the absence of the cooperation of theneighbouring States of the Mano River Union andECOWAS. It is therefore important to encourage theMoroccan and ECOWAS initiatives as complementaryefforts and not to perceive those efforts as working atcross purposes.The restoration of peace and security to Liberiacan only be facilitated by ending the activities of armednon-State actors  who sustain their activities throughexternal support. That would  therefore  require  as anessential beginning  the cutting off of all externalsupport to armed non-State actors. The achievement ofthat objective will require that the Mano River Unionmember States adhere to the Non-Aggression andSecurity Cooperation Treaty of the Mano River Union implement the 15th protocol to the Declaration of theMano River Union and implement all Mano RiverUnion decisions pursuant to the provisions of the 15thprotocol and those arising from the Moroccaninitiative. Fundamental among those decisions is thedecision of the Joint Security Committee  taken inConakry  Republic of Guinea  on 10 September 2001 regarding the endemic problems of dissidents. Thatdecision called for the apprehension and repatriation totheir country of origin of all individuals  armed groupsand other paramilitary forces involved in thedestabilization of member States.The ongoing war waged by externally supportedarmed non-State actors against the democraticallyelected Government of Liberia is a result of the totaldisregard and violation of the agreements and decisionsof the Mano River Union. That war must be brought toan end. The decision of the Mano River Union on theendemic problems of dissidents was antecedent to theend of the war in Sierra Leone and intended to put anend to the destabilization of the region by armed non-State actors and to create a mechanism for sustainablepeace and security within the Mano River Unionregion. It is  therefore  imperative that no ambiguoussignals are sent to the armed non-State actors who arecurrently destabilizing Liberia; otherwise  the efforts ofthe Mano River Union  the United Nations Mission inSierra Leone and the international community as awhole to consolidate peace and security would befutile  and would thus undermine the security of theentire region. It is  therefore  imperative that all armednon-State actors be fully disarmed as an integral part ofthe efforts of the international community to restorepeace to the Mano River Union region.The consistent denial of the United Nations toadmit the Republic of China on Taiwan into this worldbody is a violation of Article 4 of the Charter  whichspecifically states that“Membership in the United Nations is opento all other peace-loving States which accept theobligations contained in the present Charter and in the judgement of the Organization  are able andwilling to carry out these obligations.”The 23 million peace-loving people of theRepublic of China deserve to be represented in theUnited Nations. They have demonstrated their capacityand willingness fully to live up to the obligations ofStates Members of the United Nations  as they havedemonstrated in other world bodies. It is therefore theconviction of the Liberian Government that theRepublic of China should be allowed representationand participation in this world body. The LiberianGovernment continues to hold the view that it is the21Chinese people themselves  under the principles ofdemocracy and of respect for human rights  who willone day resolve the question of Chinese reunification.Liberia encourages the continuation of the cross-straitsdialogue in the interest of the greater good of theChinese people.Some scholars are of the view that the calculatedobjective of some sanctions is the achievement of athreshold of domestic suffering that will cause thepeople to rise up and overthrow their Government. Ifthis is true  then it is also true that some sanctions arenot intended to achieve compliance with UnitedNations demands  but to precipitate regime changethrough rebellion against internal conditions ofsuffering caused by sanctions. This may also explainthe indifference and insensitivity to the suffering ofpeople living in States under sanctions.In the case of Liberia  the call for a study of thepotential impact of sanctions took effect only after theimposition of sanctions  which gave an appearance ofsome humanitarian concern for the people of Liberia.Nevertheless  after 16 months of the application ofpunitive sanctions against Liberia  the Security Councilis still trying to determine the impact of its sanctionson our people. Will death represent an impact sufficientto bring about some form of moral consternation andrestraint? But for every day that a Liberian must facethe agony of sanctions  the integrity of the UnitedNations is undermined and its conscience put to thetest.The Liberian people consider their currentsuffering at the hands of the Security Council abetrayal of the dream and aspiration which inspiredtheir forefathers to join in the formation of the UnitedNations. With the benefit of hindsight  the Governmentwould have toiled in anguish as it participated in theSan Francisco Conference in 1945; not in doubt of theprinciples we ascribed to  but in fear of the potential todistort those sacred principles.Yet we remain resolute and true to the ideals andprinciples enshrined in the Charter  and we commitourselves to working with unrelenting perseverance forthe realization of peace  freedom  liberty and justice forall peoples."
"98",4100,"LCA",57,2002,"﻿I should like to add thevoice of my delegation to the voices of those who havealready congratulated Mr. Jan Kavan on his election tothe presidency and those who have thanked theoutgoing President for his contribution to the work ofthe Assembly. Saint Lucia pledges its full cooperationto Mr. Kavan as he assumes the presidential mantle.We are pleased that  at the commencement of thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly  we arewelcoming Switzerland and East Timor to ourOrganization. We have no doubt that they will bothenrich the deliberations of our organization as we seekto advance its cause. Saint Lucia  as a member of theSpecial Committee on decolonization  is particularlypleased that East Timor will at last able be to enterthese hallowed halls as an independent State in its ownright.In this age of cutting-edge technology  scientificmiracles and the conquest of space  it is barelyconceivable that human misery and suffering are stillnot decreasing. From Africa to Asia and from Asia tothe Caribbean  the HIV/AIDS pandemic is acceleratingand spreading  while known killers such as tuberculosisand malaria continue to stalk human existence. Wewatch as large parts of humanity fall  often seeming tolack the impetus needed to have a substantial impact onsuch scourges.A large percentage of the population of thedeveloping world lives in degrading poverty  and manyare on the brink of starvation and famine. Some 24 000persons  most of them from the developing world  dieeach day of hunger. Approximately 12 million people7in Southern Africa now face starvation. Yet there is aworldwide glut in agricultural production. In someplaces there is too much; in others there is too little.The crisis of the development agenda is reflectiveof the crisis of legitimacy that is being experienced bythe global economic governance structure. Saint Luciaagain calls for the reformation of the global economicgovernance system to ensure that the planet's resourcesconstitute the common heritage of all mankind. Acorollary to global economic reformation is theequitable sharing of resources to ensure a decentquality of life for all and the redistribution of wealthand power at the systemic level to redress existinginjustices so that we no longer have a world with toomuch in one place and too little in another.A major impediment to development is the lackof transparency  accountability and democratic normswithin the operations of the global governancenetwork. Saint Lucia has always upheld the democraticimperative within the domestic realm as the flagshipfor the advancement of social progress anddevelopment. Saint Lucia reiterates that it is onlythrough democratic participation and the belief that allpeople are created equal and deserve equal rights andopportunities that the right of the peoples of thedeveloping world to true self-determination anddevelopment can be realized. It is only by upholdingthe principles of transparency  accountability anddemocracy that the International Monetary Fund  theWorld Bank  the World Trade Organization and ourown United Nations system can become relevant to thetask of solving the problem of global poverty.The Doha declaration alone will not prevent theexclusion of States from economic decision-makingand global governance. The non-involvement ofGovernments in the development process runs counterto the original mission of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.Saint Lucia challenges the United Nations system toraise its universal voice  in concert with the discordantcoalition  opposing any unilateral determination of thefate of the planet's natural resources and the billions ofpoor people depending on them for survival. SaintLucia calls for the democratization and reform of theWTO into an organization supportive of the sustainabledevelopment of all States. This is the only way thatdeveloping countries can protect their interests withinthe multilateral trading system.Saint Lucia laments the fact that the developingworld may have compromised its development agendaby signing the WTO agreements without the principleof special and differential treatment being an integralpart of those agreements. This omission has to becorrected in the Doha round. Why is it so difficult tounderstand that  given the critical nexus between tradeand development  developing countries cannot besubjected to the same expectations  rules andregulations that govern trade among developedcountries? The ideology of a level playing field is amyth ill conceived. Equitable participation in worldtrade demands that special consideration and assistancebe given to the developing world  particularly tovulnerable  small island States like Saint Lucia. Wemust resist — and I underscore the word “resist” — allattempts to make the WTO a mechanism for unleashinga silent economic war on the poor and powerless byprotecting corporate interests while marginalizingGovernments and people.We need a Marshall Plan to address the terror ofpoverty and the stark disparities between the developedand developing world in trade technology  lifeexpectancy and illiteracy. Monterrey produced neithera global development coalition nor a binding mandatewith targets and resources for implementing the UnitedNations millennium goals of halving poverty effectively addressing HIV/AIDS  closing the digitaldivide and strengthening Governments. The messagefrom Monterrey is that there is neither political will norresources available for development. Of the estimated$55 billion required annually to implement themillennium goals  Monterrey pledged only $5 billionover a period of three years. Further  officialdevelopment assistance to developing countries hascontinued to decline from the United Nations target of0.7 per cent to 0.24 per cent.Despite the fact that debt servicing accounts for anet transfer of resources from developing to developedcountries  draining a significant amount ofdevelopment funds  Monterrey made no commitment tothe cancellation of the crippling debt of developingcountries. No attempts were made to stem the seriousmarginalization of small island developing States or togrant access to concessionary funding frominternational financial institutions for theirdevelopment.Sadly  Johannesburg was more of the same. Theconference was convened to strike a global deal on8sustainable development  but failed to initiate thepeople-driven process necessary to transform theglobal economic crisis into development for all. Nomechanisms were established to insulate decisionstaken from being undermined in the current globaleconomic governance system. The failure ofJohannesburg to establish an international citizen'sagenda — with clear targets  resources andcommitments to implement development goals – thatprotects the poor and the planet will reverberatethroughout the developing world.The United Nations appears to have becomecomplicit in its own demise  permitting the principlesof universality and the quest for justice and equality tobecome obsolete. This institution was once the proudchampion of the redistribution of global economicpower and the establishment of a new internationaleconomic order. Today  however  in the major UnitedNations institutions  such as the Economic and SocialCouncil  the United Nations Development Programmeand the General Assembly  there is a deafening silence.Further  the gains made by the developing worldwithin the United Nations are quickly being eroded.The post of Director-General for InternationalEconomic Cooperation and Development has beenabolished. This was one of the few concrete outcomesof the developing world's thrust to secure a strongerpresence in support of international economiccooperation. And the United Nations Centre onTransnational Corporations  which effectively trackedthe activities of transnational corporations in the Southand their contribution to sustainable development  hasbeen dismantled. Today  the market is left to determineeverything  with corporate rule of the global economyresulting in untold havoc to the environment and thepoor. No mechanism is in place to ensure corporateresponsibility and accountability.Saint Lucia urges the United Nations toreinstitute the United Nations Centre on TransnationalCorporations. Further  Saint Lucia calls on the UnitedNations to resist any attempt to weaken andmarginalize the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development.While development within the United Nationssystem is being undermined through the cutting andfreezing of the United Nations regular and core budget there have been substantial increases in thepeacekeeping budget. Military spending — particularlythat of developed countries — keeps escalating  and theUnited Nations Development Programme and theBretton Woods institutions are being reoriented awayfrom development. Development is in need of a globalcoalition  without which we will pursue wars againstterrorism in vain.Saint Lucia condemns terrorism in all its formsand manifestations. For small island developing States however  security against terrorism and other threats isnot merely a matter of military spending  but is rather amultidimensional concern encompassing matters suchas drug trafficking and small arms  transnational crime unemployment  poverty and underdevelopment.Therefore  whilst maintaining its peacekeepingmandate  the United Nations should not abandon theother mandates of its Charter — the economic andsocial development of all peoples — if it intends toremain relevant and credible. This institution needs toregain its balance and to listen to the fainting voice ofhumanity in a universal chorus proclaiming globalpeace  justice  prosperity and equality for all.It would be remiss of me if I did not at this pointreiterate Saint Lucia's call for an end to the economicembargo on Cuba and for that country to be allowed topursue its right to the development of its people and toassume its rightful role within our hemisphere.In closing  let me state quite categorically that  asa vulnerable small island developing State  Saint Luciais among those countries which require the support andprotection of the United Nations system and the safetyof a strong  democratic and fair multilateral systemmost of all. We appreciate the support received fromthis institution and from friendly countries as we seekto advance our country's development. We alsoreaffirm our commitment to working with all MemberStates to ensure peace  security and development for allpeoples."
"99",4127,"LIE",57,2002,"﻿Let me first extendmy congratulations and a warm welcome toSwitzerland  a neighbouring country of Liechtenstein on its membership in the United Nations. Switzerlandhas for centuries lived the ideals of the United Nationsas a place where peoples of different ethnicbackgrounds  languages  cultures and religions havepeacefully lived together and have founded a nationbased on democratic principles and the rule of law.Now its people have chosen to join the United Nations.We look forward to Switzerland's contribution  itsexpertise and experience in the challenging work ofthis Organization. Together with the admission of EastTimor a few days from now  this brings the UnitedNations even closer to being what it was intended tobe  a truly universal family of nations.In the past year  the United Nations has againconvened a number of meetings at the highest level  withthe best intentions and the most ambitious agendas. Thoseincluded the special session on children  the InternationalConference on Financing for Development and the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development. All these meetingshave resulted in important outcomes  but they havesometimes fallen short of the expectations of those mostdirectly affected. Bigger is not always better. Webelieve that the era of such world conferences andsummits has come to a close. We have established goodstandards and must now focus on their implementation.The Millennium Development Goals must be givenprimary importance in this respect.A few years ago  we had hoped to be entering anera of the primacy of the rule of law. Small States inparticular rely on the rule of law  both at the nationaland at the international levels  where this Organizationplays a particular role. Today  we are all challengedmore than ever to uphold the principle of the rule oflaw. The events of 11 September made us realize thatno person and no place is immune to the threat ofinternational terrorism. The international community and especially this Organization  responded vigorously.For weeks immediately after the attacks  countrieswere determined to join forces to oppose and eliminatethe threat to all of us. Today provides a goodopportunity not only to commemorate those who havedied at the hands of international terrorists  but also toreassess our common response and responsibility as theinternational community.In looking back  we realize today that the sense ofworking together we all felt was short-lived and that ithas not extended to all areas. After the terrorist attacksthere was recognition that international terrorism canonly be fought successfully if all States and nationswork together. This raised hopes for an era of genuinemultilateralism. However  those hopes vanishedquickly and were replaced by the realization thatunilateralism and confrontation were again dominant.One example of such confrontation was thedebates on the International Criminal Court  whichextended even to the Security Council. Holding thesedebates implied  ironically  that the InternationalCriminal Court jeopardized peacekeeping operations ofthe United Nations. As a State party to the RomeStatute  we welcomed the entry into force of the Statuteon 1 July as a true landmark in the history ofinternational justice. We remain fully committed topreserving the integrity of the Court's Statute. Wefound it therefore disquieting that the Council dealtwith the International Criminal Court in a mannersuggesting that the Court posed a threat to internationalpeace and security.The Security Council  above all  is called upon touphold the rule of law. The state of affairs worldwidemakes it abundantly clear that credible and effective28action by the Council is needed now more than ever.Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) illustrates howdetermined action by the Council can contribute tofighting real threats to international peace and security.My Government has attached the highest priority to thework of the Counter-Terrorism Committee establishedpursuant to that resolution. We submitted on time twocomprehensive reports on our national implementationthereof. One year after the inception of the Committee'swork  we have to take stock of its achievements and of thechallenges ahead. There are obviously different stages ofimplementation worldwide and diverging capacities ofStates  especially in the area of combating thefinancing of terrorism.Thus  it is imperative to introduce minimalstandards to which all States need to adhere. Such aneffort to set and implement benchmarks will ensure thepractical impact and continued political relevance ofthe Counter-Terrorism Committee. We all must striveto bring our national enforcement and cooperationmechanisms to the highest achievable standards. This however  must be accompanied by a set of minimumstandards which are observed and enforced globally. Asstated on previous occasions  Liechtenstein standsready to make its contribution to developing suchstandards and to contribute to compliance enhancementby offering our extensive practical expertise.Injustice must not be fought through injustice.The fight against terrorism must therefore go hand inhand with basic standards of the rule of law.Overzealous action must not  as has occurred in someinstances  jeopardize the rights of the individual. Non-derogable human rights  as contained in the relevantinternational treaties  must be safeguarded under allcircumstances. States have an obligation to ensure thatpeople who are suspected of having committed acts ofterrorism are treated in accordance with the relevantstandards. The United Nations  as the primaryinternational law-making body  has a specialresponsibility in this respect and has to live up to itsobligation to be the guardian of the rule of law.When the United Nations is called upon to upholdthe rule of law  it must  of course  ensure first andforemost the legality of its own actions in all areas and in particular  when it comes to armed action andintervention. The Charter of the United Nationsprovides for the sanctioning of such action by theSecurity Council. The debates of the past few weekshave made it clear that nothing can replace — asSecretary-General Kofi Annan put it so aptly — theunique international legitimacy provided through adecision of the Council. Legality  and thus politicalcredibility  are ensured through seizing the Council. Atthe same time  however  the full implementation of allsuch decisions must be ensured. This must therefore bethe way to go for the international community."
"100",4174,"LKA",57,2002,"﻿Let me beginby conveying  on behalf of the Sri Lanka delegation our sincere felicitations to Mr. Jan Kavan on hiselection as President of this fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly and our assurances of our fullestcooperation.I would also like to express appreciation for theexemplary manner in which Mr. Han Seung-soo former Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic ofKorea  guided the work of the fifty-sixth session. Wealso warmly welcome Switzerland as a new Member ofthe Organization  and look forward also to welcomingEast Timor.Our discussions and debates in this Assemblyoften reach great heights and seek grand objectives  butultimately they are about the future lives  well-beingand security of the people we are privileged torepresent. It is with such thoughts in my mind that Irecall the horrendous events of 11 September 2001 which claimed the lives of so many Americans andpeople of other nationalities from all over the world.As we are only too painfully aware  they are not theonly victims of terror.The attack confirmed what we in Sri Lanka havelong known: terrorism has long been globalized. AsPresident Bush acknowledged on 11 March 2002 “September 11 was not the beginning of global terror but it was the beginning of the world's concertedresponse.”We in Sri Lanka perhaps know better than mostthe tragedies that conflict and terrorism create. My owncountry has been ravaged by a 20-year conflict  whichhas caused more than 65 000 deaths. Eight hundredthousand people are internally displaced. Tragic storiesabound: children who will never see their fathers returnhome; mothers who have lost their sons; and childrenwho  even today  innocently step on anti-personnel2mines. I have talked to the disabled soldiers and thedispossessed  the people who have no homes  and thosewho return to the north-east of our country to find war-torn ruins and once productive fields sown with landmines.The election victory last December of theGovernment I represent was a clear national mandate toend the conflict in the north-east. The Government hassince moved swiftly towards the fulfilment of thatmandate. A ceasefire with the Liberation Tigers ofTamil Eelam (LTTE) was signed on 22 February thisyear. The ceasefire has held.Confidence-building measures have encouragedthe free movement of people throughout the countryand have revived economic activity. Peace talks withthe LTTE  facilitated by Norway  began two days agoin Sattahip  Thailand. The Sri Lanka Government hasunilaterally suspended the proscription of the LTTE inorder to facilitate the talks  to give peace a chance  andto give the LTTE a chance for peace.A flexible approach is necessary in thenegotiations  combining a warm heart with a cool head.An understanding of the other side  their aspirationsand their concerns  is essential. Negotiations arecomplex and will take time. In the early stages of ourtalks with the LTTE  we are trying to resolve some ofthe immediate practical needs of the people in order tobring relief and normalcy to our society. Economicreconstruction and development of the affected areaswill be a deciding factor in sustaining the momentumof political negotiations. Development is part of thehealing process in a wounded  divided society. Thepressing day-to-day problems of the people need to besettled as soon as possible.Indeed  at the discussions in Thailand  there wasstrong endorsement of the urgent need for resources toensure the early dividends of the peace process. Therole played by Norway in facilitating that process and most recently  at the peace talks is deeply appreciated. Iextend my sincere thanks to Norway for all its efforts.Already  following the ceasefire  there are signsof people enjoying their rediscovered freedom. Thepeople want more. Exchange visits between schoolchildren and other groups from the south and from thenorth have revealed to many that the other side is notso different after all. Last week our capital  Colombo came to a standstill as people from all over the country from every religion and every ethnic group in society flocked to a peace rally.Those are all encouraging signs. But with themcomes a risk. The imperative of peace is growing. Thepeople demand peace  and the politicians andnegotiators on both sides had better deliver. Peace ispeople-driven. The conflict had dragged our economyto near bankruptcy  and last year  for the first time inindependent Sri Lanka  we recorded negative growth.Resources must flow into developing the areas ravagedby war. Opportunities must be created. The momentumof growth must be re-established. The people want tosee normalcy restored  not tomorrow but today. Thefarmers want their damaged irrigation canals repairedtoday; their harvest cannot be delayed until a finalagreement is reached. This imperative is driven evenmore by young people among the Sri Lankan armedforces and the cadres of the Liberation Tigers of TamilEelam  whose weapons lie silent. Without internationalsupport and help with resources to build a peacedividend  the gloss on peace can be dulled. With therecreation of opportunities for people and for growth politicians and negotiators will be driven even harderto stabilize  advance and sustain the peace.From there  we can approach the complexconstitutional issues. Those questions will take time.We believe that the way forward is through a clearlyrepresentative interim administration within a unitedSri Lanka in which the rights of all communities Tamil  Muslim and Sinhalese  are safeguarded. Thatwill allow us to carry forward an initiative to empowerlocal people by decentralizing governmental authorityand by establishing five regional economicdevelopment zones. Through such initiatives  we intendto encourage local people to be responsible for drivingeconomic growth in their own regions. Thosemeasures  along with the liberalization andderegulation of our economy  will generate wealth.Meanwhile  there is a pressing  immediatesecurity issue. Hundreds of thousands of mines need tobe removed from tracts of land to make them safe andarable in order for the internally displaced persons toreturn to their homes and their farms. Sri Lanka isreviewing its position on the Ottawa Convention onanti-personnel mines with a view to becoming a partyto it as confidence in peace grows. We are grateful forthe help we are receiving from the United Nations members of the international community and non-3governmental organizations in our deminingprogramme.My Government is resolved to ensure that thepeople of the north and east of our Republic shouldalso enjoy the same security and the same quality oflife  democratic governance and human rights whichpeople in other parts of the country enjoy. Sri Lankahas a high rating on the Human Development Index ofthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).Our per capita income figures and our life expectancyand our literacy rates are among the highest in theregion. Peace will further enhance all that  but itsdividend must be credited to all the shareholders in SriLanka's future.Sri Lanka welcomes the support that our peaceprocess has received from members of the internationalcommunity and from the United Nations. On a requestmade by me to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  a UnitedNations inter-agency needs assessment team visited SriLanka in April and May of this year. The teamcompleted a strategic overview of the current situation which can guide immediate and mid- to long-termaction by United Nations agencies in Sri Lanka. Wethank the Secretary-General for his efforts.Quickening the pace of peace and having itsdividends credited directly and urgently to the peopleare imperative. We are grateful to all those who areassisting us in Quick Impact Projects. Theimplementation of those projects without delay willhelp peace take root  involve people in the affectedareas in their economic and social recovery and easethe way for higher stages of development.Throughout its long history  there have beenflattering descriptions of Sri Lanka — centuries beforeour Tourist Board promoted the serenity of the island.The ancient Arabs and mediaeval Europeans called ourisland paradise. If in the course of our recent conflictsome of the quality of paradise has been lost  thensurely paradise must be regained. Regaining Sri Lankais much more than a slogan  it is a practical  doablestrategy  in which we invite the internationalcommunity to participate.While seeking a negotiated solution to our ownconflict  Sri Lanka strongly supports negotiating asettlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict. We havelong supported a responsible peace process whichwould lead to the acceptance of two States  Israel andPalestine  prospering in conditions of peace andsecurity  as neighbours  within secure and recognizedborders. We urge the resumption of a serious dialoguebetween Israel and Palestine as a prelude to sustainednegotiations.In Sri Lanka  dialogue and negotiations areturning around a long  drawn-out conflict. With respectto those who were responsible for 11 September  theapproach needs to be different. No cause justifies thekilling of innocent people. Global terrorism must beeradicated  whatever its manifestation and wherever itoccurs. We support a comprehensive approach tointernational terrorism through the General Assembly'sAd Hoc Committee on Terrorism. Terrorism hasaffected virtually all the countries of South Asia. Ameeting in Sri Lanka will soon draft an additionalprotocol to the Regional Convention on Suppression ofTerrorism of the South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation. The protocol would update theConvention  inter alia to meet the obligationsdevolving on member States in respect of SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism.The United Nations has been a source of goodsince its inception. It is the forum in which there is anopportunity for interaction and possible reconciliationamong complex  competing and even confrontationalconcerns. Under the Secretary-General's initiative ofthe Global Compact  it provides for the launching andnavigation of positive partnerships between thecorporate and State sectors.We also look forward to the implementation ofdecisions taken at the International Conference onFinancing for Development  held in Monterrey. Wewelcome the Millennium Challenge Account as anoutcome of that Conference to assist countriescommitted to democratic norms and good governance to the engagement of the private sector and to theinvolvement of the people in the process ofdevelopment.In Sri Lanka  we intend to re-establish aninvestment-friendly country with an efficientbureaucracy and a thriving private sector. On this visitto the United States  I have brought a team from myindustrial sector to talk to United States businessmen.We are grateful to the United Nations for helping myGovernment to organize an investment promotionforum in the United States tomorrow with the4participation of members of our private sector  whowill interact with their counterparts here. Those “closeencounters of the business kind” will provide insightinto the opportunities for collaborative economic anddevelopment ventures in Sri Lanka as we moveforward on the peace front. Investment in peace makessound political and economic sense for both Sri Lankaand its partners abroad. Growth in Sri Lanka will begood for everyone.Across Sri Lanka  the people continue to buildthe only true peace we can hope for. Without fanfare without politicians or media  they are quietly goingabout their business  finding old friends and buildingnew relationships. Mistrust and suspicion are slowlymelting away as people talk and share past experiences.The hatred in some hearts will take a little longer todispel. But even that will be overcome in time by thedeep desire for weapons to be destroyed  mines to becleared and the sound of laughter to be heard onceagain.Trusting the people  whether it be for theconsolidation of peace or the pursuit of development  isthe best policy. We are beholden to the people we workfor  whether they be clients or customers orshareholders or voters."
"101",4216,"LSO",57,2002,"﻿My delegation associatesitself with compliments extended to the Presidentfollowing his election to the presidency of this session to his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  and to theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. KofiAnnan.The admissions of the Democratic Republic ofEast Timor and of the Swiss Confederation tomembership of the Organization are a joyous occasionfor my delegation. We welcome and indeedcongratulate those two countries and nations as theyjoin our family of nations.As we meet here today  Lesotho and some othercountries of the southern African subregion are in thegrip of a most devastating and unprecedented foodshortage  as a result of a combination of floods unseasonable frost and drought  consequent uponclimatic changes that have hit the region in the recentpast.On 19 April of this year  when the Government ofthe Kingdom of Lesotho declared a state of famine  itwas evident that over half a million people  out of atotal of 2.2 million  faced a severe food crisis. Sincethen  efforts have been made at the national level toaddress the problem.Let me take this opportunity  on behalf of theGovernment and the people of the Kingdom of Lesothoand  indeed  on my own behalf  to express our gratitudefor the rapid response of the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies and programmes and that of thedonor community to the crisis facing my country.HIV/AIDS  which has emerged as a major healthand development threat  continues to be a source ofgrave concern in my country. Most of those who areinfected are between the ages of 15 and 45 andconstitute the potential and active workforce inLesotho.Of equally great concern is the corrosive effectthat HIV/AIDS has on the family structure and on thesocial fabric of our society. We now have a largenumber of orphans and child-headed households. Thosewho are sick not only lack adequate counselling andmedicine but also lack care and support.My delegation therefore makes a special appeal tothe international community to provide adequatefinancial support for the African countries  in order toarrest and  indeed  to redress the spread of HIV/AIDS.In this regard  the efforts of the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations in establishing the Global Fund tofight AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria are mostwelcome. Indeed  Africa as a whole needsunconditional support in many other areas  particularlyin the sectors of agriculture  health  nutrition  waterand sanitation and education. Undoubtedly  there is astrong link between poverty and the scourge of HIV/AIDS.The Monterrey Conference on Financing forDevelopment  the Doha Ministerial Conference ontrade and the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment provided useful forums for discussingsteps that must be taken to remove obstacles toeconomic growth and sustainable development particularly in the developing countries. We arehopeful that commitments made by our cooperatingpartners mark a beginning of the process of helping theleast developed countries (LDCs) to translate goals andtargets of major global conferences and summits intoconcrete actions. My delegation reiterates that themarginalization of LDCs can be ended only if they areassisted in integrating profitably into the globaleconomy.Africa took a very bold and decisive step recentlyin Durban  South Africa  in launching the AfricanUnion. There is no doubt  as many may have observed that while the road to this Union was strewn with manyobstacles  there is now some light at the end of thetunnel. This hope is premised on the principles thathave guided us in the last thirty-nine years of theOrganization of African Unity (OAU). The Africa oftoday is committed to the principles of democracy stability  peace  security  good governance and the ruleof law. Above all  modern Africa is committed to goodeconomic management because it is  indeed  themismanagement of our economies that has often led toconflicts on the continent.5The New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD) is a home-grown African strategy and anAfrican Union programme for Africa's development. Itis a commitment by African leaders to eradicatepoverty and to place the continent on a path of lastinggrowth and development. My delegation  therefore appeals for more international support for NEPAD. Webelieve that the role of the entire internationalcommunity in supporting NEPAD  and the role of theUnited Nations in the coordination and synchronizationof activities related to ensuring its success  wouldindeed provide a fresh impetus for Africa'sdevelopment.The right of a people to self-determination is ahuman right and a fundamental principle enshrined inthe Charter of the United Nations. The peoples ofWestern Sahara and Palestine  therefore  deserve noless. Hence  my delegation urges that efforts toemancipate these nations be strengthened and speededup.Lesotho is gratified that one of the oldest andlongest running conflicts in Africa has finally come toan end with the signing of the ceasefire in Luanda Angola  early this year  by the representatives of theNational Union for the Total Independence of Angola(UNITA) and the Government of Angola. However Lesotho and other Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) countries  as well as theinternational community at large  are alarmed by theharsh social and economic conditions that confrontinternally displaced persons and refugees who return totheir homes in Angola.We appreciate the efforts of the entire UnitedNations system to address this situation. We are of theview that a lot more still needs to be done for theAngolan people  including the provision of significantadditional resources as called for by the United NationsSecretary-General  in order to address the humanitarianneeds of the people of Angola.Despite the temporary disruption of the ceasefirenegotiations  my delegation is convinced that theMachakos Protocol signed between the Government ofthe Sudan and the Sudan People's LiberationMovement and Army  remains a viable framework forthe realization of durable peace in the Sudan. We urgethe warring parties to return to the negotiation table inearnest and in good faith.The situation in the Democratic Republic ofCongo has also been a source of concern to us all. Wewish to congratulate the Governments of theDemocratic Republic of Congo  Rwanda and Ugandafor the signing of the peace agreements  which shouldpave the way for the withdrawal of troops from theDemocratic Republic of Congo. We believe that thiswill also ensure that the security concerns of theneighbouring countries are adequately addressed whilst at the same time creating conditions that areconducive for the Congolese people to live in peace intheir own country.Terrorism has become one of the most pressingconcerns of the international community in recenttimes. The Government of Lesotho has joined otherpeace-loving members of the international communityin waging war against this heinous crime.The Government of Lesotho is committed to thefull implementation of Security Council resolution1373 (2001)  and  despite financial and technicalconstraints  we will continue to discharge ourobligations  as stipulated in that resolution.The shocking images of atrocities perpetrated inRwanda and in the former Yugoslavia will forever beembedded in our minds. They have served as a painfulreminder to the international community that suchcrimes should never go unaccounted for and theirperpetrators unpunished. In that spirit we hail thelandmark agreement reached between the UnitedNations and the Government of Sierra Leone toestablish an independent special court for theprosecution of those responsible for the serious decade-long crimes against humanity committed in theterritory of Sierra Leone. We hope that the creation ofthis special court will contribute greatly to the processof national reconciliation and healing  as well as to therestoration and maintenance of peace in Sierra Leone.The Government of Lesotho reveres the cominginto force of the Statute of the International CriminalCourt  a momentous period when the countries of theworld affirmed their intolerance of those who commitcrimes against humanity with impunity. We thereforeinvite those States that have not yet done so  to becomeparty to the Statute  so that we may embark on thisnoble but difficult pursuit in solidarity.I should not conclude this statement withoutmaking reference to the issue of the reform of theSecurity Council. The process of democratization is 6indeed  very difficult  and yet inevitable. It essentiallyinvolves a lot of compromise and understanding on thepart of those who cherish and uphold the basic tenets ofdemocracy and equality of States. My delegationtherefore wishes to reiterate its concern that this organof the United Nations  which is charged with themaintenance of international peace and security  hasitself not yet moved to be more inclusive and morerepresentative. Here again  efforts need to be redoubledand the pace accelerated."
"102",4242,"LTU",57,2002,"﻿First of all  I would like toexpress my thanks to Mr. Han Seung-soo  President ofthe previous session of the General Assembly. Weappreciated his skilful guidance and leadership. Wewish you  Sir  as incoming President  a year ofconstructive dialogue and fruitful cooperation.I also would like to take this opportunity towelcome Switzerland and East Timor  which arejoining the United Nations family. This expansion ofUnited Nations membership is very important. It istaking place at a time when the need for globalsolidarity and partnership is greater than ever before.Terrorism threatens global stability and the very basisof our lives. Our countries must stand united and acttogether in order to avert threats to our existence andsecure the future of our children.My country knows from experience how powerfuland instrumental solidarity can be. Some years ago Lithuania and eight other countries of Central andEastern Europe formed an informal Vilnius Group which has now grown to 10 members  to facilitate theiraccession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO). Solidarity and mutual support are helping usto make these aspirations a reality that is within ourgrasps. We hope that our countries will soon join theEuropean Union and NATO  thus reinforcing commonvalues in the region as well as our common positionsand actions in the face of future challenges and threats.But political solidarity is not enough. Ourcountries have also launched regional initiatives andtaken other concrete steps to increase contributions tothe global campaign against terrorism. In particular  Iwould like to mention the conference againstterrorism — a Polish initiative — that was held inWarsaw last November. Our countries are determinedto act and cooperate further  thus strengtheningEuropean and global security.In the face of common threats  solidarity mustemerge as a consolidating driving force in globaldiplomacy. The tragedy of 11 September was anexperience that reinforced and strengthened ourcommon resolve to combat and counter terrorism. Itshould give us the courage and determination to worktogether as an international community in addressingthe roots of terrorism; in responding decisively to non-compliance with Security Council resolutions and togross violations of internationally recognized normsand behaviour; in fighting terror worldwide; and inkeeping weapons of mass destruction out of the handsof terrorists.It is regrettable  therefore  that a Member of thisgreat body  the United Nations  does not uphold itscommitments or the underlying principles of thisOrganization. The Iraqi regime must allow unrestrictedaccess to United Nations inspectors so that they canresume their work. We should exert all possiblepressure to ensure this. Indeed  this is a test case withrespect to the international community's solidarity andunity.22Last but not least  I would like to underscore theimportance of international and regional cooperation innon-proliferation and arms control. It has always beenLithuania's firm policy to take part in all relevant effective and functional multilateral arms control andconfidence-building regimes that are open to us andthat correspond to our national security interests. Thisyear  Lithuania has applied for membership in theTreaty on Open Skies. We will also seek to join theadapted Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces inEurope after it comes into force and is open to allEuropean democracies.Each and every State Member of the UnitedNations should make a positive contribution tointernational security and stability  first and foremostby respecting the rule of law and the human rights ofits citizens. Good governance is a good starting pointfor all of us  irrespective of our cultural diversity orfundamental differences of history and geography.President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  whodevoted much time to the planning of this multilateralinstitution known as the United Nations  once said “We have learned that we cannot live alone  at peace;that our own well-being is dependent on the well-beingof other nations far away.” Thus  the real strength ofour power as an international community continues tolie in the power of our resolve to deal with the criticalissues.Yesterday in this great city of New York  we paidour respects to the victims of 11 September 2001. Weadmire the way the American people have gonethrough this tragedy  and we support the United Statesof America in its efforts to eliminate threats tointernational security and human freedom. Let usdebate  talk things out and make full use of diplomaticmeasures. But we must be ready to act decisively whenstrategic realities demand defence of freedom anddemocracy."
"103",4286,"LUX",57,2002,"﻿The current Chairman of the European Union Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen  has already had anopportunity to state to the Assembly the priorities andpositions of the European Union. Luxembourg  throughits commitment on a day-to-day basis  reaffirms itsdedication to multilateral cooperation and to the workof this universal Organization.President Kavan  you assumed your importantpost through a new procedure designed to revitalize thework of the General Assembly and intensify its impact.I am sure that under your guidance we will achieveother significant successes.Mr. Han Seung-soo guided the work of theprevious session during a period when the internationalsituation was difficult and beset by serious problems.Thanks to his extensive experience and hisunderstanding of international issues  a calm andfraternal message of cooperation and concerted actionresulted from our debates. We all are deeply grateful tohim for that.4Our Organization also has the advantage ofhaving a Secretary-General whose humanism andoutstanding diplomatic skills are universallyacknowledged. He has begun his second term with hischaracteristic dynamism  which we all admire.We wholeheartedly support the Secretary-Generalin the discharge of his important mission. There is nodoubt that multilateralism and the support of the UnitedNations system for it have their own particulardynamic. We are counting on him to guide theOrganization in accordance with the guidelines set outin the important statement he made last Thursday.Regarding Iraq  we believe that the internationalcommunity must continue to work through the UnitedNations  which is charged with the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Iraq must provideunconditional and unimpeded access to the inspectorsas well as the necessary cooperation. It must fulfil itsobligations immediately. We are determined to supportthe efforts of the United Nations to achieve that goal.International law was strengthened considerablywith the entry into force of the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court on 1 July last. Thisrepresents a major step forward in the process of thepromotion of the rule of law and in the fight againstimpunity. This young institution must receive our fullsupport. Indeed  it represents a guarantee in terms ofthe desire for protection  which is so deeply rooted ineach of us. The broadest possible ratification of theStatute of the Court must remain a high-priorityobjective of the international community. TheEuropean Union is actively working to that end toensure that the Court is genuinely universal in nature.In the same multilateral context  theJohannesburg World Summit on SustainableDevelopment has just concluded with the observationthat our planet's natural reserves and resources arelimited and that only solidarity can reconcile thelegitimacy of development and the preservation of anenvironment that respects life. It is humankind'sresponsibility to achieve a balance in these two cases.The Summit charted a course through the Plan ofImplementation  which sets out objectives andtimetables. Some may feel that they are not ambitiousenough  but they certainly can guide us. We need toimplement this plan  and here new partnershipsbetween the United Nations  Governments  companiesand civil society are an important tool. Governments however  still must shoulder all of theirresponsibilities.In Doha  the World Trade Organization decided tolink the opening of markets and technical assistance todevelopment. In Monterrey  a global consensusemerged regarding financing for development. In thewake of Johannesburg  there is a need now to createsynergetic relationships between public assistance support from companies  local resources and thecommitment of non-governmental organizations.Poverty  pollution  overexploitation and  unfortunately violence  too  will continue for a long time to fuelpessimism.However  we are encouraged to note thatdemocracy and good governance are concepts andpractices that are moving forward and that areincreasingly broadly accepted. In this context  I shouldlike to pay tribute to the young African Union  whichspecifically included among its objectives theadvancement of the principles of democracy and itscorollary  the protection of human rights.Human rights  democracy  development andsecurity are closely linked. The Council of Europe whose principal mission is the championing of humanrights  pluralist democracy and the rule of law  has  likethe United Nations  had to face an tremendouschallenge following the events of 11 September. Likethis universal Organization  the Council of Europe whose chairmanship Luxembourg has held sinceMay — its tenure is for a six-month period — hastaken a series of specific measures in the internationalcampaign against terrorism.In addition to advancing the process of thesigning and ratification of international instruments the Council has devised guidelines for an internationalcampaign that includes full respect for human rights.Indeed  when security is threatened  respect for humanrights becomes all the more important. As statesmen  itis our obligation to prevent anti-terrorist legislationfrom infringing on  or even destroying  democracy inits attempt to champion the fundamental values offreedom and to safeguard human rights.The events of 11 September provided a newimpetus  as we all are well aware  to cooperationbetween institutional partners and  above all emphasized the need to pursue dialogue betweencultures and religions and to step up the process ofreflection on civilizations in order to promote tolerance5and universal respect for human rights when we arefaced with barbarism. Like the United Nations and theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization  the Council of Europe is committed tothat policy.Coordination and complementarity betweenregional and international organizations are  moreover among those priorities that Luxembourg has set for itschairmanship. It might thus be useful to establish linkshere with the important centres of the Councilof Europe  namely the European Court of HumanRights — a unique mechanism for the protection ofhuman rights; the European Commission againstRacism and Intolerance; and  finally  the Committee forthe Prevention of Torture. It is indeed my hope that theimportant work on norms and standards carried out bythe Committee at the European level will one day beimplemented at the international level  and that theOptional Protocol to the United Nations Conventionagainst Torture — a Protocol that the Assembly willsoon be called on to endorse — will enjoy the samesuccess as its European predecessor. The establishmentof the rule of law for all of us is an objective for whichthe High Commissioner for Human Rights  Mrs. MaryRobinson worked tirelessly. She deserves our gratitudefor her courage and her contribution to this vital cause.Her successor  Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  can alsocount on our full cooperation and support.The special session of the General Assembly onthe rights of children in May 2002 allowed us  onceagain  to condemn that indifference which kills andcauses great suffering to millions of disadvantaged anddefenceless individuals. While the Convention on theRights of the Child has made it possible to specificallyimprove the lives of countless individuals  work mustbe stepped up and expanded in order to guarantee thatthere will be a real difference for generations to come.We view action in favour of women  which fallsunder the Convention on the Elimination of All Formsof Discrimination against Women  in the same context.Luxembourg would like to reaffirm its dedication to thesignificant work carried out by the United Nationsfunds and agencies in these areas. In particular I wouldlike to mention the United Nations Children's Fund(UNICEF)  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) United Nations Development Fund for Women(UNIFEM) and the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP). International action forreproductive health is at the crux of their programmesand today it remains indispensable. It requires firmsupport and the necessary budgetary resources. This iswhy Luxembourg firmly supports the efforts ofUNFPA.Reducing funding for women in difficulty istotally unjust and considerably increases the sufferingof these individuals. To be sure  the work of thosededicated persons who inspire these programmes —including quite a few non-governmentalorganizations — will not come to an end any more thanthe labours of Sisyphus. But  are we not all aware ofthe progress which has been made possible in the dailylife of individuals  groups and peoples  progress madethrough institutions which have been carefullyconceived  democratically established  well managed which in addition benefit from the moral authorityprovided them by the United Nations?Bearing in mind the destiny of the individualswho are threatened here  international officials must beprovided with the means to detect at an early stage anypossible violation of peace and international security. Aheightened awareness of our responsibility to providefor the protection of civilian populations is in factnecessary to allow for preventive action and  inparticular  for maintaining peace.As has been rightly noted by the Secretary-General  such preventive action should be done bystrengthening the capacity of operational and structuralprevention on all levels: local as well as national regional and international  bilateral and multilateral.Increased interaction between all these levels isrequired so as to replace a culture of reaction by agenuine culture of prevention. The importance ofinvesting in conflict prevention strategies  which mayonly yield fruit much later  is not always obvious. Sucha choice requires a strong will of commitment by all ofits players.For its part  our universal Organization  throughthe Security Council and other bodies of the UnitedNations system  is dedicated to defining an outline ofpossible international action for prevention to make itmore systematic and effective. The pivotal role of theUnited Nations and its authority are essential toachieve this end. It will be up to the fifty-seventhsession of the General Assembly to deal with thisquestion as well.Increasingly  the need to focus attention on thedestinies and tragedies experienced by victims and6react to the fact that conflicts today deliberately andincreasingly claim victims among the civilianpopulation can be given priority status  becauseinternational relations today are no longer hampered bythe ideological battles of yesterday. However antagonisms have not disappeared and may even cloakthemselves in new forms. We need to remain vigilant.One year ago  the international community wasdeeply shaken by the terrorist attacks of 11 September2001 against the civilian populations of New York Washington and Pennsylvania. A few days ago wevisited Ground Zero as a sign of our grief and toreaffirm our determination to act against barbarity.While we can indeed note that the efforts made sincethat tragic day to combat international terrorism haveachieved some specific results  this should not however  prompt us to let down our guard. Othertragedies are still open wounds  such as the particularlyobvious case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The Middle East  since Oslo  has seenextraordinary efforts at mediation. Faced with violenceand hate  non-intervention and keeping one's distanceare not real options. Efforts are continuing  aimed atcreating conditions for new negotiations that mightmake it possible to conclude the work that has beenlanguishing since Taba. The European Union isactively participating in this process and is makingefforts  through new initiatives of the Danishpresidency  to once again put the political context atthe heart of our concerns. The tireless efforts of theinternational community are required to emphasize theneed for moderation. Moderates  on whatever side have no easy task when faced with extremism. But wesupport them. Peace requires all of us  in fact  to beinternally split  as noted by Mr. Shlomo Ben Ami  but I would add  it will also include reconciliation. Andthis must be prepared with the new external partner andalso with those reluctant domestic forces  which mustbe reintegrated into the peace process.Developments in Sri Lanka  moreover demonstrate that hope can win the day over violence.In the case of Timor-Leste  it is also thanks to theUnited Nations that this hope has been fulfilled. And inAfrica  several hotbeds of tension have been eased in2002  in Angola  in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and in Burundi in particular. The effort made bythe international community in Afghanistan must  aswe know  be continued over time to insure theestablishment and functioning of a stable democraticand fully representative State. The process ofnormalization under way in the Balkans deservessimilar attention.After some 160 years of existence as anindependent State  Luxembourg is fully aware of thelimits inherent in its size and the means available to it.In foreign policy we are acting with the firm convictionthat the multilateral system of cooperation is one whichprovides a place and a role for everyone. In aninterdependent world  we all must shoulder ourresponsibilities and make our contribution. And that isthe basis of our commitment to the universalOrganization  as it is the basis of our action to supportdevelopment in the world. This is why we wish to raiseour official development assistance to 1 per cent ofGNP  after having been  in 2001  in the position to gobeyond the threshold of 0.7 per cent recommended bythe United Nations.Our Organization brings together the internationalcommunity. It is the unique forum which allows forexchanges and allows us to chart the path for totallynew solutions. And I am gratified to see that duringthis session there are two new Members here in 2002 namely Switzerland and Timor-Leste. We congratulatethem on having taken this decision and we extend awarm welcome to them to our Assembly."
"104",4312,"LVA",57,2002,"﻿I would like to beginby congratulating the Swiss Confederation on its recentaccession to the United Nations Organization.Switzerland's immeasurable contribution to the work ofthe United Nations  even as a non-member  has beenwidely recognized and appreciated for decades. I amconfident that Switzerland  in its new capacity as aMember State  will assume an even more significantrole in United Nations activities  a role compatible withits new status.Later this month the United Nations will greetanother country  East Timor  as the newest member ofthe Organization. Like my own country  Latvia  whichregained its independence only 11 years ago  EastTimor will face the difficult challenges ofconsolidating its statehood and enhancing its economicdevelopment.The United Nations and the internationalcommunity can be proud that their concerted efforts tocreate a climate of peace and security on that islandhave met with success  and that the people of EastTimor are now able to be the masters of their owndestiny.I would also like to express Latvia's continuedsolidarity and sympathy with the people of the UnitedStates  one year and one day after the horrifyingterrorist attacks that changed the world forever. Thecourage and resilience displayed by the inhabitants ofNew York following the destruction of the World TradeCenter has been truly remarkable  and the manner inwhich New Yorkers have coped with the aftermath ofthis tragedy has been an inspiration to us all. Today  aswell as on the anniversary date itself  Latvians theworld over are with the bereaved and with the peopleof the United States in our thoughts and in our prayers.We see the heinous crimes of 11 September not only asa contemptible act of aggression against the UnitedStates  but also as a direct and frontal assault againstthe civilized world as a whole.19The foundation of any civilized society rests onits deep-seated respect for the sanctity of human life.International terrorists hold human life in total andutter contempt. International terrorists specificallytarget civilian non-combatant populations  with theexpress goal of extinguishing as many human lives aspossible. That is precisely what makes internationalterrorists so dangerous and so threatening.Latvia  in collaboration with the United Nations the European Union  the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization (NATO) and all like-minded countries  isdetermined to do everything in its power to stem thegrowing threat of international terrorism. In the wakeof the 11 September attacks  the Latvian Governmenthas adopted an action plan that foresees Latvia'sratification of all international anti-terroristconventions  as well as an increase in the capacity ofLatvia's administrative  security  law enforcement andmilitary structures. We are continuing to harmonize ournational legislation according to international andEuropean Union standards  and we are tightening ourcontrol of immigration and the flow of strategic goods.We are improving our air and border surveillancecapabilities  updating our emergency responseprocedures and raising the public's preparedness fordealing with emergency situations.I would like to express Latvia's concern at thefact that one of the Organization's Member States —Iraq — continues to ignore repeated calls by both theSecurity Council and the rest of the internationalcommunity to allow United Nations weaponsinspectors on its territory. This lack of good will andthis manifest atmosphere of secrecy only serve toreinforce credible suspicions that that country isclandestinely seeking to produce nuclear  chemical bacteriological and other weapons of mass destruction in clear violation of Security Council resolutions.Latvia views such clandestine activities not only asdestabilizing to the region  but also as a threat to worldsecurity. That is why Latvia believes that the UnitedNations and the rest of the international communitymust act deliberately and decisively to curb thecontinuing threat of weapons proliferation posed byIraq.Latvia congratulates the United States of Americaon the respect expressed by President George W. Bushfor the United Nations as an institutions and on thecommitment he expressed this morning to the principleof multilaterality that the United Nations embodies. Weapplaud the willingness of the United States to engagethe international community  through the UnitedNations and through the Security Council  on thelegitimate concerns of the United States with regard tocontaining and eliminating visible and defiant threatsto peace and stability in the world.Latvia realizes that in this globalized world of thetwenty-first century  no nation can be an island untoitself. Several other alarming threats besidesinternational terrorism and arms proliferation presentsuch serious challenges to the human race that we canhope to address them only through concerted and long-term international cooperation. These pressing globalissues include organized crime and illegal trafficking the abuse and exploitation of women and children endemic poverty and unemployment  drug addictionand disease  and environmental pollution.The global ecological crisis that our planet is nowexperiencing has resulted from our own recklessdisregard for the Earth that sustains us. If we do notradically curb the excessive amount of greenhousegases and other pollutants that we produce every day then we will continue to experience natural disastersand climate changes of increasing scope and frequency.I am proud to note that Latvia ratified the KyotoProtocol earlier this summer  and I share the hope ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan that the recent WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  held inJohannesburg  will lead to an increased commitment toenvironmental protection by the countries Members ofthe United Nations. Latvia is pleased that target dateshave now been set regarding safe drinking water sanitation and permissible levels of harmful chemicals.Yet we must not allow ourselves to slip intocomplacency  as the goals that our countries set at Rioin 1992 at the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development are still far from beingreached. This past spring  Latvia established asustainable development council  led by the country'sPrime Minister. That council will establish plans forthe sustainable economic  social and environmentaldevelopment of the country  in conjunction withEuropean Union policies.Two years ago  the States Members of the UnitedNations adopted another series of far-reaching goalswhen they signed the Millennium Declaration on thereduction of poverty. Unfortunately  we cannot yetpride ourselves on having achieved notable progress in20that sphere. If the laudable goals of the Declaration aretruly to be realized in practice  then the StatesMembers of the United Nations will have to display afar greater degree of political will and practicalcommitment in implementing them.The United Nations itself will need to increase itsadministrative capacity if it is to effectively cooperatewith its Member States in realizing the goals of theMillennium Declaration. Thanks to the initiative ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan  several improvementscan already be seen in the work of the United Nations particularly regarding the reform of peacekeepingoperations and the level of collaboration among theOrganization's own institutions.Further improvements could still be made in thefinancial discipline of the Organization's MemberStates through the timely payment of membership duesand more rational use by Member States of UnitedNations services at United Nations conferences.Initiated reforms within the United Nations systemitself must continue in order to put an end to theoverlapping of functions and to prevent unnecessarycompetition among the Organization's variousinstitutions. Sounder spending practices and reducedpaperwork  along with a reduction in the number ofmeetings and conferences with overlapping themes would all further increase the effectiveness of UnitedNations activities.Despite certain deficiencies in the structure andwork of the United Nations  the Organization hascontributed tremendously to the economic and socialdevelopment of numerous Member States  includingmy own country  Latvia. When Latvia regained itsindependence 11 years ago  it had to undergo a rapidtransformation from an occupied nation with arepressive political system to a liberal parliamentarydemocracy that respects human rights and liberties  andit had to transform its closed and planned State-runeconomy to an open and free-market economy. Thanksto the hard work undertaken by Latvia's people andtheir commitment to implement difficult transitionpolicies — as well as the dedicated support of theinternational community — Latvia now has one of thefastest-growing economies in Europe  along with astable national currency and a low rate of inflation.Within a few months  Latvia hopes to receive officialinvitations to join the European Union and the NATOalliance.Many of the positive changes that Latvia hasexperienced over the past decade have been activelysupported by the United Nations  and particularly bythe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).Latvia's new social security system  which is now oneof the most modern in Europe  was implemented withdirect UNDP participation. The UNDP and the LatvianGovernment are also cooperating in the implementationof minority integration programmes in our country.Latvia is still in the process of reforming its health andeducation systems and  like other countries in Europe must confront the problem of an ageing populationresulting from a falling birth rate  the number of deathseach year continuing to exceed the number of births.Nevertheless I am proud to note that on 17 Junelast Latvia and UNDP signed a memorandum ofunderstanding by which Latvia's status as a recipient ofUnited Nations assistance was changed to that of a netcontributor. Latvia sees its intellectual potential and itsexperience in the implementation of transition reformsas a national resource. We have now entered the phaseof sharing this resource with other developing nations.During the past two years  Latvia  in cooperation withCanada and the European Union  has been providingtechnical assistance and expertise to Ukraine  Georgiaand Croatia.Latvia is convinced that the reduction ofdisparities in income and standards of living among theworld's nations is essential for the consolidation ofpeace and security across the globe. That is why Latviahas liberalized its trade regime with 49 of the world'sleast developed countries  in accordance with the Dohadevelopment agenda. Within its means and throughUnited Nations channels  Latvia has also providedhumanitarian aid to war-torn areas in the Balkans andin Afghanistan.Every nation  no matter how large or how small is possessed of its own intrinsic  inalienable value.Every nation has its unique contribution to make tohumanity as a whole. Let us remember this as we meethere today at this fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly. Together  our nations have many seriouschallenges to address. But I am confident that byuniting our experiencing and resources  we shalleventually succeed in reducing poverty  cleaning upour environment  controlling the spread of diseases and making this world a safer and more secure place inwhich to live.21The United Nations Organization was createdfirst and foremost to serve for the benefit of humanity.It was created as an instrument for propagating thefundamental principles of democracy  humanism universality  mutual respect and understanding.Although the people and nations of the world are vastlydiverse in their conditions of life and in their cultures all human beings share the same basic needs anddesires: access to the basic necessities of life  thepossibility of growing and evolving as individuals  andthe change to contribute to the growth and developmentof the countries that we each call home. As fellowinhabitants of our beautiful and fragile planet  let uspledge to commit our efforts to protect the physicalequilibrium of the earth and to create a fairer social andeconomic equilibrium across the globe."
"105",4359,"MAR",57,2002,"﻿Ishould like at the outset to express to you  Sir  onbehalf of the Kingdom of Morocco  our sincerecongratulations on your election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session and toassure you of my delegation's full cooperation with aview to achieving a fruitful outcome to the session.I should also like to take this opportunity toextend greetings to the Swiss Confederation andcongratulations on its membership of the Organization.Given the cultural  humanitarian and intellectualheritage of that friendly country  its contribution willenrich the work of the Organization.We also wish to congratulate Timor-Leste on itsforthcoming accession to the Organization  and to wishthat country every success.Just three days have elapsed since the firstanniversary of the tragic events of 11 September 2001.Those events deeply wounded the people of the UnitedStates and shook the entire world with horror.International relations have since entered a new phasewhose dimensions and repercussions we are stillassessing. Those events brought into focus thecohesion and solidarity of all segments of theAmerican people in the face of such tragedy. They alsobrought to the fore the effectiveness and usefulness ofsolidarity and cooperation among States in combatingterrorism. Indeed  as His Majesty King Mohammed VIhas stated  terrorism has no religion or homeland.Everyone is aware of the Kingdom of Morocco's firm10stance and its renunciation of terrorism in all its forms as well as its vigorous and concrete commitment tocombating this scourge.The gradual disappearance of economic bordersand barriers to trade  the continued interdependence ofmarkets and societies  the rapid development ofinformation and communication technologies and therelegation of certain peoples to the sidelines of theworld community have all added new challenges to theburdens already carried by numerous countries  inparticular those in Africa  which have made greatsacrifices in order to be integrated into the world tradesystem.The African continent  unfortunately  is still astage of tragic  complicated and generally fabricatedconflicts. While Africa teems with huge natural andhuman resources  those very resources paradoxicallybecome the cause and the fuel of many conflicts. Yetthe international community remains hesitant to takedecisive and necessary measures likely to create aclimate propitious for peace and stability in ourcontinent.Seldom are the underlying reasons for conflictand instability in Africa taken into account. Of specialimportance in that regard are poverty  famine  theoppression of minorities  intolerance  control of naturalresources  increased flows of refugees and displacedpersons and health problems including endemicdiseases  in particular HIV/AIDS.But now  to face up to all these challenges  ourcontinent has established an integrated framework: theNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).It will certainly give new impetus to the economic andsocial development of the continent. Morocco expresses its hope that the international communitywill mobilize all its efforts within the framework ofthis energetic programme in order to reach effectiveand concrete solutions for solving the problems of ourcontinent. My country is firmly intent on making aneffective contribution to this endeavour.The Kingdom of Morocco  convinced of theorganic link between economic growth and themaintenance of stability and security  has spared noeffort to help in settling African conflicts. In this vein Morocco  on the initiative of His Majesty KingMohammed VI  convened a summit of heads of Stateof the Mano River Union  which was held at Rabat on27 February 2002. At the summit  the Presidents of thesister countries of Guinea  Liberia and Sierra Leoneachieved practical results on consolidating regionalpeace  particularly with regard to laying down criteriafor confidence-building  border security andrevitalizing the work of the general secretariat of theMano River Union. Morocco will pursue the necessaryefforts to restore peace and stability in that region.In the same vein  the Kingdom of Moroccocontinues its support for and contribution to the workof the United Nations Organization Mission in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)  with aview to putting an end to conflict in that sisterlycountry  conflict which threatens stability in the wholeregion. In that context  my country  the Kingdom ofMorocco  welcomed the agreement concluded on 30July 2002 between the Governments of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and Rwanda.The Kingdom of Morocco expresses also itsprofound satisfaction at the restoration of peace andstability in the sister country of Angola  which willenable that country to rebuild its economy and to fullyplay its role at the regional  continental andinternational levels.Concerning the issue of the Moroccan Sahara  theKingdom of Morocco would like to recall its constantgood will  and its sincere and genuine determination toreach a final political solution to this fabricated issue.Morocco has always cooperated with the UnitedNations in this regard  thus bearing testimony to its fullunderstanding of and sense of responsibility towardsthe Organization. Morocco would like also toemphasize its readiness to continue its cooperationwith the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy Mr. James Baker  with the Security Council  in order toachieve a lasting political solution to the issue of theSahara  in accordance with Security Council resolution1429 (2002). Such an approach will pave the way forthe creation of propitious conditions for a new dynamicin the region of the Arab Maghreb  which will enable itto become a stable economic partner that enjoys thetrust of other regional groupings.In this context  Morocco has supported the optionof the framework agreement proposed by Mr. Baker tothe Security Council as a basis for a negotiatedpolitical solution for this long-standing conflict. Thatoption would preserve the territorial integrity of theKingdom of Morocco and its historical sovereigntyover its land  and would ensure for the population ofthe Sahara provinces the exercise of expandedcompetencies in the management of their affairs withinthe framework of regional democratic institutions.Morocco accepted this option as a basis for negotiationin order to reach a final and lasting political solution tothis regional conflict.In the same context  Morocco insists on theenforcement of the provisions of Security Councilresolution 1429 (2002)  calling for the immediaterelease  without restriction or condition  of all the1 260 Moroccans detained in Algeria. Their release hasbeen demanded unanimously by the internationalcommunity and humanitarian organizations  in theforefront of which is the International Committee ofthe Red Cross (ICRC). Morocco categorically rejectsany political exploitation of humanitarian issues relatedto the Sahara problem  especially since this concernsthe fate of the longest-held detainees in the world.The Kingdom of Morocco is linked to Europe bystrong and diverse historic bonds. The strengthening ofthese bonds with all European countries constitutes acentral tenet of our foreign policy. The AssociationAgreement which has been concluded with theEuropean Union  and the other initiatives to strengthenMoroccan-European relations at the political economic  cultural and social levels  reflect Morocco'sdetermination to enhance this relationship  particularlyat a time when the European Union is in the process ofexpanding its membership  something that would opennew opportunities and horizons for Moroccan-European partnership. This approach not only seeks toachieve a bilateral strategic objective between Moroccoand Europe  but it is also a valuable contribution tonurturing relations in the Euro-Mediterranean region whose security and stability have become paramountfor the world.Morocco  by virtue of its Mediterranean identity plays a positive role in the strategic  economic andcultural formation of a Euro-Mediterranean space  aswitnessed by its active participation in the Barcelonaprocess and in the Agadir initiative announced by HisMajesty King Mohammed VI for building a free-tradearea among Arab Mediterranean countries.In that spirit of open-mindedness  responsibilityand confidence in the future  Morocco aspires todevelop its relations with our neighbouring country Spain  with a view to building the Euro-Mediterraneanregion and moving forward. Unfortunately  however recent months have been marked by events that areinconsistent with the maintenance of security andstability in the region and that are unlikely to serve theinterests of the two countries and their peoples.Morocco has spared no efforts in avoiding anymove likely to affect adversely the steady growth of itsrelations with Spain  hopes that the upcomingMoroccan-Spanish talks  which will take place inMadrid this month  will tackle all issues and conflictsbetween the two countries  within the framework ofresponsible  calm and constructive dialogue.The completion of Moroccan territorial integrityis an absolute priority for His Majesty KingMohammed VI and for the entire Moroccan people.Therefore  Morocco considers the status of theoccupied cities of Sebta and Melilia and of theneighbouring islands to be an anachronistic instance ofcolonialism that has no place at the beginning of thetwenty-first century.Morocco has never ceased  neither at the bilaterallevel nor in international forums  to officially demandthe recovery of these parts of its national territory thatare occupied by Spain. In so doing  it has alwaysexpressed its readiness to engage in dialogue in orderto arrive at a solution that would guarantee Morocco'ssovereign rights and secure the interests of the Spanishcommunity in the areas.We fervently hope that the two neighbouringkingdoms  Morocco and Spain  which are bound by tiesof neighbourliness  common history and future  willbuild strong  stable and neutral relations to meet theaspirations of both peoples. As they build with mutualrespect  confidence and common strategic interests these relations will take into account the need forpreserving stability and peace in our region particularly at this specific juncture when theinternational community is confronting formidablesecurity challenges.In spite of continued appeals made by theinternational community to bring about peace in theMiddle East  the Palestinian people still suffer on adaily basis from the mad violence inflicted on them bythe Israeli occupation forces and practices that flout themost elementary principles of internationalhumanitarian law. Notwithstanding successive SecurityCouncil resolutions  Israel still persists in its repressivepolicy  paying no heed to any international covenant12and denying the very agreements into which it hasentered.In contrast  leaders of the Arab States havedemonstrated a keen sense of responsibility and acontinued pledge to embrace peace  culminating at theArab summit in Beirut in March 2002 with theadoption of the Arab peace initiative presented by HisRoyal Highness Crown Prince Abdullah ibn Abdul-Aziz of the sister Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. On theother hand  Morocco welcomes the vision advocated byUnited States President George W. Bush  in which hecalled for the establishment of a Palestinian State tocoexist side by side with Israel  as a lasting and viablesolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  one likely toachieve peace and security for all peoples of the regionand to put a definite end to violence and instability.However  recent events and developments in the regiondo not  unfortunately  give substance to this vision. Thespiral of violence has instead witnessed anunprecedented escalation.For decades  the Kingdom of Morocco has beenendeavouring to act as a bridge between the peoples ofthe region  with a view to achieving a climate of peaceand security and contributing to the revitalization ofthe peace process  the creation of an independentPalestinian State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capitaland the recovery by Syria and Lebanon of theirterritories occupied since 1967.In view of the importance of Al-Quds al-Sharif asa key point in the peace process  and seeking topreserve the national and religious identity of this HolyCity in accordance with the relevant Security Councilresolutions  His Majesty King Mohammed VI Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee  is continuing hisefforts  along with brother Kings  Emirs and Presidentsof the Muslim member States of the Committee  withthe United States of America and the RussianFederation in their capacity as peace patrons  and withthe presidency of the European Union  with HisHoliness the Pope and with the United NationsSecretary-General  in order to safeguard the IslamicArab character of Al-Quds al-Sharif and to preserve itas a place of coexistence and tolerance among the threerevealed religions.The Iraqi issue has become a major preoccupationfor the entire world  owing to the suffering of the Iraqipeople. For this reason  while we demand that Iraqimplement the relevant United Nations resolutions  wealso call for deep reflection and patience in dealingwith the Iraqi question  hoping that the IraqiGovernment will respond to the internationalcommunity's request. The aim would be to avoid theinfliction of further suffering  distress and misery onthe Iraqi people. At any rate  the United Nations isrequired to act within the framework of its Charter'sprinciples and purposes in order to preserve thestability and security of all countries in the region. Inthis context  Morocco expresses its concern with regardto the Kuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons and the need to preserve the unity and independence ofthe State of Kuwait. Morocco also emphasizes the needto preserve Iraq's unity and sovereignty over all itsterritory.The same region is witnessing another conflictinvolving two sister States that have strong bonds offriendship and cooperation with Morocco — that is  theUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran.My country is hopeful that our brothers in Iran willbecome convinced of the need to settle the conflictover the islands of Abu Musa  the Greater Tunb and theLesser Tunb  by peaceful means  in accordance withthe principles of the United Nations Charter and therules of international law. This will affect positivelytheir bilateral relations  as well as the stability andcooperation in the region.In conclusion  under the leadership of HisMajesty King Mohammed VI  the Kingdom ofMorocco  as a member of the African  Arab  andMuslim family and given its position in the Euro-Mediterranean region  has always held dear the basicvalues of tolerance  moderation  open-mindedness anddialogue in dealing with the international community.Morocco will always honour its obligations towards theinternational community to strengthen the foundationsof security and stability and to give impetus to the newvisions charted for the world of the twenty-firstcentury. We will always remain ready to contributewithin the United Nations to finding the most efficientmeans of improving conditions in the world."
"106",4383,"MCO",57,2002,"﻿First of all I wish to thank the President of thefifty-sixth session of the General Assembly  HisExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo  for the masterful wayin which he accomplished his work. I would also liketo thank the members of his Bureau. Significantprogress was made during the session we recentlyfinished. One item in particular concerns us as itinvolves the conduct and revitalization of ourproceedings.Secondly  I would like to take this opportunity towelcome the decision of the Secretary-General toappoint  as of 12 September 2002  Mr. Sergio Vieira deMello to succeed Her Excellency Mrs. Mary Robinsonas United Nations High Commissioner for HumanRights. My Government has always appreciated Mrs.Robinson's wholehearted commitment and knows itcan count on Mr. Vieira de Mello  who has many timesshown his competence and his dedication to theOrganization  to show just as much commitment inpromoting and protecting human rights.I am very pleased at the outset of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly tocongratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to thepresidency both on my own account and on behalf ofthe highest authorities of my country  as well as tocongratulate all the members of the Bureau. I pledgethe full support and cooperation of the delegation ofMonaco to help them complete their important work.One year ago  an attack  as vile as it wascowardly  struck the United States of America. Thatday its instigators and perpetrators placed themselvesnot only outside of the law  but outside humanity outside of the universal fundamental values andprinciples that inspire our nations and guide the ethical political  economic and social progress of States. Thatwanton act provoked an unprecedented reaction fromthe international community. It unanimously gave themembers of the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly sophisticated means to fight terrorism in allits forms  including by cutting off its financialresources.The Principality of Monaco participated in thisfight with determination in response to requests by theSecurity Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee.In broadening information exchange with other States both bilaterally and multilaterally  we established orstrengthened monitoring and surveillance measureswhich were necessary in the of legislative  regulatory and judicial spheres.On 10 November 2001 I personally signed theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism  which entered into force inMonaco on 8 April 2002  and our PermanentRepresentative to the United Nations  on instructionsfrom my father  the Sovereign Prince  signed on 24June 2002 Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing ofTrafficking in Firearms  Their Parts and Componentsand Ammunition  supplementing the United NationsConvention against Transnational Organized Crime.The Principality of Monaco  in fact  is or will bea party to all major universal and regional instrumentsdesigned to strengthen cooperation among nations tofight against terrorism. This has greatly enhanced ourcooperation with other States.In that regard I must make reference to a lawwhich was adopted unanimously last June by ourNational Council  the parliament of Monaco  andwhich entered into force on 8 August 2002. This lawamends  strengthens and supplements the existing lawon the involvement of financial entities in the fightagainst money-laundering and financing terrorism. Thetext takes into account Monaco's undertakings as aUnited Nations Member State as well as measuresanticipated by competent bodies such as the FinancialAction Task Force.Also on 8 August 2002  the authorities of mycountry were happy to have implemented the Councilof Europe Convention on Laundering  Search  Seizureand Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime  eventhough the Principality of Monaco  while ferventlyhoping to be so  is not yet a member of that nobleEuropean institution. I also wish to note the speed andrelevance of my country's response  especially since8our country is sometimes subjected to unjustified andincorrect criticism in this area.While terrorist threats persist and while civilianpopulations continue  unfortunately  to be subjected tothe yoke of terror  the origin and form of this plagueseem now to be better understood and under greatercontrol. Measures  both national and international have been implemented with the help of the SecurityCouncil and its Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)and seem to be yielding encouraging results. Thestrengthening and broadening of the mandate of theTerrorism Prevention Branch  as the Secretary-Generalhas proposed in the report requested by our Assembly seems to meet all of the conditions we need to upgradethe fight against terrorism  not only by allowing us tobolster cooperation among United Nations MemberStates  but also by providing enhanced technicalassistance to countries that ask for it.Thanks to a prompt and effective internationalreaction  Afghanistan  for too long a home to terrorists has regained its freedom. Its new provisionalGovernment  which emerged from the traditionalassembly  the Loya Jerga  last June  has endeavoured particularly with the help of our Organization  torebuild the country and to establish a democraticpolitical regime. We wish it full success.Another area of satisfaction on the part of theinternational community is the nuclear disarmamentagreement that was adopted last May by the two greatPowers  the United States of America and the RussianFederation. Other events in the world are also hopeful.The Republic of Sierra Leone and the Republic ofAngola are taking steps towards recovery in a peacefuland democratic spirit. Encouraging signs of hope areseen everywhere. In Africa  we again fervently hopefor the success of the peace initiatives in Burundi andin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Acalming of the situation in the Sudan is also of greatinterest to us.The Organization of African Unity (OAU)  whichbecame the African Union last July  has played aninvaluable role in reinforcing harmony betweenAfrican peoples. We are following this undertakingwith intense interest  as it took on a new dimension thisyear. We take this opportunity to address to HisExcellency  Mr. Amara Essy  Interim Chairperson ofthe Commission of the African Union  our sincerecongratulations and encouragements.In Latin America  we see with hope that somecountries  whose economic and financial conditionswere once in bad shape  are in the process of recovery thanks in particular to the help of internationalfinancial institutions.In Asia  finally  the prudence shown by theleaders of India and Pakistan over the border disputeshas led to the reduction of tension in Kashmir. We aresincerely grateful for this. This is an excellent step similarly to the one taken by Sri Lanka  which hasrenewed the dialogue with the Tamil separatists so as toput an end to too much suffering.Another source of satisfaction is Timor-Leste which with the effective and valuable help of ourOrganization was able to successfully achieveindependence and acquire political and financialstructures that are crucial to its development. We aretherefore happy to welcome very soon  the DemocraticRepublic of Timor-Leste to the United Nations. We arealso quite happy to welcome the admission of theSwiss Confederation as a Member State.Switzerland has always been  particularly sincethe creation of the League of Nations in Geneva  asteadfast participant in the international promotion ofpeace  human rights and humanitarian protection. Ourcongratulations and wishes for success and prosperityare formulated to those two States  to their leaders andto their people.The United Nations needs them more than evernow  and also needs all the good will and talentpossible to meet the high ambitions that we set forourselves when the Organization was created ambitions renewed firmly and solemnly at theMillennium Summit  as well as during the largeinternational meetings that followed.My country is committed to implementing theaction plans adopted during those exceptionalmeetings. Our special session on children and thesecond World Assembly on Ageing have tangiblychanged the perception that the internationalcommunity had of children and seniors. Both mustbecome actors who are more integrated and activewithin our societies.While deciding to increase its voluntarycontributions to the large programmes of the UnitedNations aimed at development and the protection of theenvironment  the Government of Monaco has at the9same time decided to concentrate its efforts on specificareas and specific regions. The Mediterranean region isan example of our fight against marine pollution thataims to save regional flora and fauna. My Government whether through its Office for InternationalCooperation for Development and the Environment  orthrough non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which are numerous and active in Monaco  isencouraging the implementation of specific projects projects that are essentially ecological in nature depending often on the availability of micro-credits.As regards the Mediterranean Sea  next 10December we will be celebrating the twentiethanniversary of the United Nations Convention on theLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS). It was indeed on 10December 1982 that that text was open for ratificationby States at Montego Bay in Jamaica. It was the resultof almost 15 years of negotiations  which we willsolemnly celebrate on this coming occasion.There are particularly difficult times  such as thepresent moment  when the status quo is not goodenough  times when we must show determination inorder to bring innovative ideas to meet the fundamentalchanges going on throughout the world. The Secretary-General  whose dynamic nature and wisdom weappreciate  mentions this in his report on the follow-upto the major conferences organized by the UnitedNations at different summits  including the MillenniumSummit. The report is important and timely.The substantive session of the Economic andSocial Council in July also confirmed the need for suchsteps. The Ministerial Declaration  adopted on thatoccasion  focuses usefully on the importance ofdeveloping human resources  protecting health  andproviding education  particularly for young girls  andfocuses on their contributions to development. I would like to commend the President and theBureau of the Council. His Excellency Mr. IvanSimonović  its President and the PermanentRepresentative of Croatia  and the other Members ofthe Bureau have all toiled with competence and greatskill in order to guarantee the success of the Council'swork.During the high-level debates  some trendsemerged that our Government believes are essential.For example  there is the choice of a governance thatallows us to establish true partnerships that dependmostly on the human resources of developing countriesthemselves  as well as on businesses and civil society.Yesterday's high-level plenary meeting of theGeneral Assembly produced solemn and excellentresults and enabled us to gain a better understanding ofthe character and the imperatives of the NewPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD)  whichundoubtedly offers real prospects for mobilizingresources for Africa and integrating it into the worldeconomy. The establishment by the Economic andSocial Council of an ad hoc advisory group for Africancountries emerging from conflict is a step that we arealso following. Without political stability  there can beno guaranteed sustainable development.The concept of a culture of protection' advancedby the Secretary-General  with regard to specialeconomic assistance  humanitarian aid  and help innatural disasters  provides the advantage of associatingin a single thrust preventive action and priorityassistance to the communities affected. We appreciatethe principle and the scope of this activity.In the aftermath of conflicts and crises  the linkbetween humanitarian action and long-termdevelopments is crucial for the success of any nationalreconstruction programme. Public meetings of theSecurity Council dedicated to such matters provide anopportunity to emphasize  with the necessary impact the importance of such measures.The World Summit on Sustainable Development(WSSD)  which has just finished in Johannesburg andin which I participated  reminded us of the essentialconcerns for the future. The Monterrey consensus wasconfirmed  stressing the fact that there can now be nostable and balanced development without seriousinterdisciplinary thought and innovative ideas based ona genuine will to protect our environment and torespect the natural resources of our planet  includingsea resources and non-renewable natural resources  byensuring that we share them fairly and reasonably.The Summit confirmed and strengthened theprinciples proclaimed 10 years ago during the UnitedNations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio.I will not reiterate my country's positions andinitiatives on these questions  as I discussed them atlength at Johannesburg. I should like to reaffirm however  that the Government of the Principality of10Monaco is determined to respect the commitments itundertook on that occasion.The international community must continue towork tirelessly in the combat against AIDS and in thefight against many endemic diseases  which  in someparts of the world  are major obstacles to developmentand progress. In response to the appeal launched by ourSecretary-General  my Government has decided thisyear and for the next two years to make a substantialexceptional contribution to the Joint United NationsProgramme on HIV/AIDS.If we want globalization  in particular economicglobalization  to be of benefit to all  it will have to berooted to a greater extent  and we all are aware ofthis  in a type of development that ignores neitherthe basic needs of human beings nor the values ofjustice  morality and equity  to which we all attachparticular value.In speaking of the fundamental principle ofjustice and of the moral values which have inspired ourOrganization so profoundly  I should like to reiteratehow warmly we welcomed the recent entry into forceof the Rome Statute of the International CriminalCourt. The first Assembly of States Parties to the RomeStatute has just been held  under the eminentpresidency of His Royal Highness Prince Zeid Ra'adZeid Al-Hussein  Permanent Representative of theHashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Decisive and specificsteps were taken on that occasion.I should like to close by appealing to the peoplesof Israel and Palestine to put an end to the violence andto overcome their rancour and resentments. A sharedheritage and the belief in a future of coexistencerepresent the underpinnings of a dialogue leading topeace."
"107",4408,"MDA",57,2002,"﻿On behalfof the Government of the Republic of Moldova  I joinother delegations in congratulating Mr. Jan Kavan onhis election as the President of the fifty-seventh sessionof the General Assembly. I would also like to expressmy sincere thanks to his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for the competent manner in which he managed24this forum during the dramatic period of the previoussession.I would also like to take this opportunity towelcome the Swiss Confederation as a Member of ourfamily of nations. We look forward to welcoming EastTimor as the 191st Member of the United Nations inthe near future.One year after the terrible attacks of 11September  we remember the innocent victims of thosecrimes. As a result of that tragedy  the world changedfundamentally in many ways. The internationalcommunity agreed to start fighting terrorism in all itsforms. The international anti-terrorism coalition  led bythe United States  succeeded in significantlyundermining the capacity of the Al-Qaeda terroristorganization and in removing the Taliban regime which had hosted it. The General Assembly and theSecurity Council took prompt action resulting inmandatory measures aimed at eliminating all forms andmanifestations of terrorism and requiring MemberStates to take administrative  financial  legal and othersteps. The immediate  effective and  even moreimportant  united action by the United Nations againsta terrorist threat that had now reached a new levelshows the Organization's continued importance andviability. Once more  we saw the capacity of the UnitedNations to fulfil its noble mission by uniting andmobilizing us for this relentless fight.The Republic of Moldova supports those actionsand reaffirms its commitment to fighting terrorism inall its forms. My country has been taking concreteaction towards the implementation of all relevantUnited Nations decisions  especially Security Councilresolutions 1373 (2001) and 1390 (2002). First concrete steps have been taken to consolidate ourdomestic anti-terrorist legislation. Moldova presentedtwo relevant reports to the Counter-TerrorismCommittee. Only months after those tragic events  ourParliament adopted a law to combat terrorism and alaw to prevent and combat money-laundering. Relevantmodifications were introduced to the Criminal Code.With its recent accession to the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombingand to the International Convention against the Takingof Hostages  as well as its ratification[n of theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism  Moldova is about to concludeits process of acceding to the 12 main internationalinstruments related to combating terrorism. We call onall Member States to undertake new efforts to concludethe United Nations Comprehensive Convention onInternational Terrorism.At the same time  as a new independent State  weask for expert support in implementing some of thosecomplex measures. Moldova has shown its politicalwill to combat terrorism by actively participating innew efforts within the framework of many regional andsubregional organizations  including the Organizationfor Security and Cooperation in Europe; theCommonwealth of Independent States; the StabilityPact for South-East Europe; the South-East EuropeCooperative Initiative; and the Georgia  Uzbekistan Ukraine  Azerbaijan and Moldova Group.The stabilization and rehabilitation process inAfghanistan is a test for the Organization and for therest of the international community. Considerableprogress has been achieved  and we must commend thejob done by the anti-terrorism coalition under verydifficult conditions  the efforts of international donorsand  above all  the efforts of the Afghanistanleadership  led by President Hamid Karzai. The SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General forAfghanistan  Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi  hasrepeatedly urged the international community tomaintain its strong and active support for theGovernment and people of Afghanistan. We share theview that stability for Afghanistan must be seen withinthe context of a broader stabilization process thatsecures increased support from international financialorganizations for all Central Asian countries.Undoubtedly  there is an urgent need for moresubstantial efforts to bring an end to the Middle Eastconflict. This year has been marked by successiveterrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and by Israel'sdisproportionate use of force against the Palestinians.We support the efforts of the Quartet to restart thepeace process on the basis of the relevant UnitedNations resolutions in order to achieve the peacefulcoexistence of Israel and an independent PalestinianState within secure and internationally recognizedborders.We share the concern expressed by manyprevious speakers on the situation concerning Iraq  andwe call on Baghdad to comply immediately and fullywith all relevant Security Council resolutions. In thatregard  we welcome the statement made recently in thisHall by President Bush recognizing the central role of25the United Nations and calling on it to shoulder itsresponsibility. Moldova  a country with an economy intransition  attaches great importance to the UnitedNations agenda for development and  in particular  theimplementation of the United Nations MillenniumDeclaration. The International Conference onFinancing for Development held in Monterrey thisyear  the Doha Development Agenda and the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburgconstituted an essential step in the convergence ofinternational efforts in such vital areas as theeradication of poverty and the reversal ofenvironmental and resource degradation.The external debt burden  the lack of necessaryresources  weak financial and banking systems frequent natural calamities and droughts areundermining many of the efforts made by ourGovernments. Unfortunately  some recommendationsimplemented at the request of and at the insistence ofsome international financial institutions have proved tobe relatively  or even totally  ineffective. While theyaccept primary responsibility for the well-being of theircitizens  many Governments in the developing worldare still waiting for promised resources.My country welcomes the entry into force on 1July of this year of the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court (ICC)  which inaugurateda new era in the affirmation of fundamental humanrights on the world stage. Moldova has begunpreparations to join the ICC  which we believe willbecome an effective  competent and equitable legalinstrument.The recent debates in the General Assembly onthe New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD) demonstrate that the world strongly supportsthe unprecedented integration processes taking placeon the African continent.The Republic of Moldova welcomes the creationof the African Union. We share the view that theUnited Nations and the entire international communitymust remain fully engaged in resolving the conflictsthat still prevail in many parts of Africa.Conflict prevention is the central challenge facingour Organization. The Secretary-General called for theUnited Nations to move from a culture of reaction to aculture of prevention. Poverty  inequality and injusticeare most frequently named as causes of conflicts.Separatism is also one of the phenomena provokinginstability and conflicts in many parts of the world.While we are mentioning the improvement in theBalkan situation  there are still a number of so-calledfrozen conflicts in the post-Soviet area  creatinginstability in the entire region. Despite many years ofnegotiations the separatist regime in Transdniestriacontinues blatantly to ignore any efforts made by theMoldovan Government  the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and othercountries  to oppress the local population and violateelementary human rights. By creating new obstacles tothe process of removing ammunitions and weapons  theTransdniestrian separatist regime is putting at risk thefulfilment of the Istanbul OSCE Summit decision which was reaffirmed by United Nations GeneralAssembly resolution 55/179 concerning the withdrawalof all foreign forces and armaments from the territoryof the Republic of Moldova by the end of this year.Another reason for our deep concern is theexistence of a huge quantity of unregistered arms at thedisposal of paramilitary units. At industrial sites of theformer Soviet military complex in that region  theseparatist authorities produce different types ofweapons  which are delivered through third countriesto other areas of conflict  thus assisting terrorist andcriminal groups  as well as other separatist regimes.The considerable changes that have occurredrecently in the international arena have highlighted theoverwhelming role that the United Nations must play inorder to consolidate democratic values and institutionsand ensure peace and stability. My delegation fullysupports the efforts made by Secretary-General KofiAnnan toward reforming our Organization. Some stepshave been taken to revitalize the work of the GeneralAssembly. The reform of the Security Council willmake it more equitable and consistent with theexpansion of the international community and willbetter reflect new realities. We support the expansionof permanent and non-permanent membership  so as tolet those Member States that are willing and able  tobetter contribute to the maintenance of internationalpeace and stability.The United Nations has also contributed to theeconomic and social development of my country.United Nations agencies and especially the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) haveactively participated in the implementation of manyimportant programmes  thus finding lasting solutions tomany challenges and helping our young democracy to26survive. We also commend the activity of UNICEF inMoldova for helping the newest generation of ourcitizens navigate through this difficult period oftransition.In conclusion  I would like to take thisopportunity to express my Government's warmestappreciation to the Secretary-General for the efforts hehas exerted in order to maintain peace and security andfor his outstanding contribution to promoting andfostering the role of the United Nations. The award ofthe centennial Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nationsand its Secretary-General was highly welcomed allover the world.In this year's annual report on the work of theOrganization the Secretary-General writes:“Developments during the past year haveaffirmed the Organization's increasing relevancein world affairs; but a review of the work of theOrganization is also a reminder that much stillneeds to be done to achieve the aims and goals ofthe Charter and the Millennium Declaration.”(A/57/1; para. 230)Let us work even harder to ensure that the UnitedNations is able to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century."
"108",4452,"MDG",57,2002,"﻿The Madagascar delegation  which I have the honourof leading for the first time at this session of theGeneral Assembly  is delighted to congratulate Mr. JanKavan on his well-deserved election to the presidencyof this session  and we wish him every success.To his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  weexpress our most sincere appreciation for having ledthe fifty-sixth session to a successful conclusionthrough dedication and skilful leadership.The dedication of our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  to the attainment of the objectives ofthe United Nations deserves our full appreciation andgratitude.The admission of the Swiss Confederation as anew Member of the United Nations is for Madagascar asource of profound satisfaction. This friendly countryis a living example of a peaceful and multiculturalsociety based on values of democracy and freedom.Here today  in the framework of thecommemoration of the tragic events of 11 September2001  we wish to express our solidarity with the peopleand the Government of the United States. We reiterateour condemnation of such terrorist acts  whoseconsequences are incalculable. A global phenomenonwithout borders  terrorism is considered to be the mostdangerous enemy of the new millennium. It can beeradicated only through harmonious internationalcooperation.In this regard  we wish to pay tribute here to theefforts of the United Nations  acting through theCounter-Terrorism Committee created by the SecurityCouncil  for the implementation of Council resolution1373 (2001)  and we commend all other regionalinitiatives adopted to combat this plague. To fightterrorism  countries such as ours will need specialtechnical assistance in order to implement thisresolution of the United Nations  as well as otherinternational treaties.The persistence of areas of tension and conflictaround the world  especially the Middle East  demandsthe reinvigoration of the United Nations to make itmore effective in responding to the needs of theinternational community  particularly in maintaininginternational peace and security. To pursue this criticalobjective  we must now more than ever strengthen ourefforts to make the Security Council more democratic more representative and more transparent.There is no doubt that the United Nationsprovides us with the ideal framework for creatingconditions that encourage States and peoples to choosepeace over war. In this regard  Madagascar wishes tocongratulate Timor-Leste on its independence after avaliant and heroic struggle by the people of that13country and successful efforts by the United Nations tore-establish peace there.Furthermore  Madagascar encourages themediation efforts undertaken by the United Nations forthe settlement of conflicts in a number of countriesthroughout Africa. In this context  I wish to reiteratethe profound gratitude of the Malagasy people for therole the United Nations agreed to play in resolving thepost-election dispute that threatened Madagascar. Thiscrisis is now over and Madagascar is now experiencinga new era full of hope.We are convinced that sustainable developmentrequires the consolidation of the rule of law and theestablishment of good governance. Towards this end the new Government is taking all appropriate measuresfor the sound and rational management of publicfinances and of international assistance. Madagascarhas given the fight against corruption the very highestpriority. We have also taken the initiative to insure thatan effective policy is developed and applied in order totackle this evil on all fronts. Madagascar supportsGeneral Assembly resolution 55/61  through which ourGeneral Assembly decided to create an ad hoccommittee entrusted with negotiating a future legalinstrument against corruption. Our country is awaitingthe conclusion of such an instrument in the near future in order to fill the gaps in its own legal system. Welook forward with considerable interest to the high-level Conference in Mexico in 2003 for signing aconvention against corruption.The rapid and sustainable development ofMadagascar is the major and fundamental objective ofthe present Government  in order to extract the countryfrom the scourge of poverty  a source of instability thaterodes democratic values. In this context  Madagascaris committed to a pro-active policy aimed at recoveryfor rapid and sustainable growth of its economy  inwhich the private sector will be the driving force.As we see it  the key to development ispartnership between the public sector and the privatesector  in which the Government works together withprivate companies and non-governmental organizationssolely for the benefit of the people. We invite privatebusinesses to invest in Madagascar. The returns onthose investments will be beneficial both to them andto the Malagasy people.As an essential component of development and ofpeace  education is our priority of priorities. Malagasychildren will live fully in the world of the twenty-firstcentury  which is characterized by advancedtechnology of information and communications. Thus Madagascar welcomes the adoption of Assemblyresolution 56/258 calling for a World Summit on theInformation Society to be held in 2003 and in 2005.The world community will then have a uniqueopportunity to discuss information and develop theopportunities offered by digital technologies  inparticular in Africa and in the least developedcountries.The Republic of Madagascar is ready to doeverything in its power to put the country back on thepath of development. This will be done with thesupport of the international community in theframework of mutually advantageous cooperation.I take this opportunity to express our gratitudeand our appreciation to all of Madagascar'sdevelopment partners  bilateral  regional and multi-lateral  for their valuable contribution to the re-launching of economic activity in our country.Faced with multiple challenges in our era  a timedominated by poverty and underdevelopment international cooperation is no longer a choice; it is anabsolute necessity for the survival of humanity. Thosefactors that diminish us as human beings: poverty HIV/AIDS  famine and illiteracy  cannot be eliminatedwithout a true spirit of solidarity  guaranteeing a betterfuture for all people. Let us not forget that thepreamble of our Charter announces a new humanitywith peoples and human beings living in dignity andsecurity. Towards that end  they must have access tofundamental human rights  the right to health care  theright to education and to culture  and the right to adecent income. Our mission  to reduce povertyeverywhere in the world  has become today moreimportant and more urgent than ever before.The slowdown in economic activity  on a globalscale  following the attacks of 11 September 2001  hasworsened impoverishment and plunged millions ofindividuals into a state of dire need. In this grimcontext  globalization could play a vital role in thefight against poverty  as long as the countries of thenorth and the south are offered the same opportunitiesof development.In order for globalization to truly benefithumankind  it must take into consideration the interests14of all countries the world over  in an internationaleconomy of sharing.Global interdependence and better internationaleconomic cooperation must be entirely accepted  if weare to obtain the objectives of the MillenniumDeclaration. A collective awareness to develop a realpartnership for development is indispensable in orderto make a reality of that objective. In this spirit Madagascar welcomes the consensus reached at theInternational Conference On Financing ForDevelopment  which was held in Monterrey.In the same context  Madagascar urges theinternational community to give firm and concretesupport to the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  and to give that support bothbilaterally and multilaterally. With the objective ofgiving an important role to the private sector indevelopment  Madagascar fully and without reservesupports the principles and objectives underlyingNEPAD. In the coming months  I intend to makeMadagascar one of the leading countries of NEPAD because I am sincerely committed to good governance the development of infrastructures and energy education  new technologies  access to the markets ofdeveloped countries and the protection of theenvironment.The alarming conclusions of a United NationsEnvironment Programme report entitled AfricaEnvironment Outlook'  as well as the recent weather-related disasters in Central Europe and Asia  requirethe international community to develop a new code ofethics for the conservation and effective protection ofthe environment. Our Government will make theprotection of our precious environment one of our mainpriorities. Furthermore  Madagascar hopes that theSummit on Sustainable Development held inJohannesburg a few days ago will give new impetus toour collective determination to offer all countries anopportunity to develop in a way that benefits theirinhabitants  their environment and our shared heritage the Earth.By some standards  Madagascar is a poor country.However  it is rich in unique natural resources and ineducated human resources. Above all  its population isattached to democracy  family values and belief inGod.We would like today to express our desire tocooperate with the United Nations as a partner for thereconstruction of Madagascar. By working inpartnership  we will ensure for our country a future ofhope. The entire world will come to know us by ourstrengths  not our weaknesses.Working together with the United Nations family Madagascar is ready to make its own contribution tobuilding a global village in which all countries receiveequal treatment and have equal opportunities for fulldevelopment - an indispensable condition for theestablishment of lasting peace."
"109",4491,"MDV",57,2002,"﻿Mr. President  it givesme great pleasure to join others in congratulating youon your election to the presidency of this session of theGeneral Assembly. This is not only a recognition ofyour wisdom and ability to successfully guide the workof this important session  but also a demonstration ofthe high regard the international community has foryour country  the Czech Republic.I would also like to take this opportunity to paytribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. HanSeung-soo of the Republic of Korea  for the exemplarymanner in which he guided the work of the fifty-sixthsession.On behalf of my Government  I would like toextend a very warm welcome to Switzerland on itsadmission to the membership of this Organization. Weare eagerly looking forward to welcoming theDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste into our midstshortly.Eight days ago  the friendly people of the UnitedStates remembered  with profound sorrow  the deathand destruction inflicted upon them by murderous actsof terrorism on 11 September 2001. Those brutal andcowardly acts sent waves of deep shock and angerthroughout the world. My country was quick tocondemn the attacks and to express its solidarity withthe people of the United States. We shared their grief and we extended our sympathies to the Americanpeople. Today  with our modest resources  we standwith the international community in the global fightagainst terrorism and in banishing the scourge ofterrorism from the face of the earth.My country believes that the United Nations  theprimary global organization responsible for themaintenance of international peace and security  mustplay the central role in the fight against terrorism. Wewere encouraged by the swift response of the SecurityCouncil  taken under Chapter VII of the Charter  afterthe horrifying attacks on the United States last year.Total compliance with Security Council resolution1373 (2001)  which details the measures to be taken bythe international community in combating terrorism  isof utmost importance. My country also believes that itis essential to strengthen the existing national  regionaland international legal framework against terrorism ifwe are to effectively fight this war. The proposedcomprehensive convention on international terrorismand the international convention for the suppression ofacts of nuclear terrorism need to be finalized as soon aspossible.The unprecedented economic ramifications of theevents of Nine-Eleven were enormous. Small islanddeveloping States like my own have not recoveredfrom the adverse economic effects of the events yet thus demonstrating the vulnerability of our economies.Our losses were immeasurable. Nonetheless  recentdevelopments in the area of international economiccooperation appear encouraging. The Doha agenda andthe Monterrey consensus offer new hope for achievingsustainable development. The transformation of thosecommitments into concrete action  and achievement ofthe Millennium Development Goals depends on forginga new form of partnership with shared responsibilitybetween the developing countries and the rest of theworld. We expect the developed countries to fulfil theirpart of the understandings  while the developingcountries endeavour to fulfil their obligations.My country  the Maldives  has made considerableeconomic strides in the past. With the continuedassistance of the international community  we havedemonstrated the effectiveness of official developmentassistance (ODA). It is true that two decades ofpolitical stability  and sound social and fiscal policies 5combined with hard work  have improved the standardof living of our people. We are immensely proud of ourmodest achievements and grateful to those who helpedus. Yet  our narrow economic base poses formidablechallenges to our desire for continued economicgrowth.Globalization and trade liberalization have addednew dimensions to our difficulties. The inherentstructural weaknesses of our economy convince us thatthe preferential access to markets and concessionalcapital we now enjoy as a least developed country haveno alternative form of compensation. Quite simply  wecannot sustain our development without these specialtreatments.These considerations compel us to strongly resistthe call for the graduation of our country from the listof least developed countries. We genuinely believe thatthe international community should continue assistingus in our quest to overcome the structural constraintsimpeding our arrival at a level of sustainable growthuntil we overcome the inherent vulnerabilities of oureconomy.The Committee for Development Policy willpresent its recommendations on the question ofgraduation of the Maldives from the list of leastdeveloped countries to the substantive session of theEconomic and Social Council in the year 2003. Weurge the Committee to complete the necessarygroundwork  in accordance with all the relevantEconomic and Social Council and General Assemblyresolutions  before it gives its views on this veryimportant matter.A fortnight ago  we met in Johannesburg at theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development to takestock of our achievements since the Earth Summit inRio 10 years ago. The facts are disappointing anddiscouraging. What we have achieved over the past 10years is far less than what we have not. And  whileapathy keeps progress curbed  environmentaldegradation of the world is continuing unabated. If weare to halt and reverse environmental degradation  wemust not only pledge urgent action but also take it. AsPresident Abdul Gayoom of the Republic of Maldivesemphasized in his address to the World Summit onSustainable Development  for sustainable developmentto happen “Agenda 21 must be implemented. The KyotoProtocol must be universally honoured. TheBarbados Programme of Action must be carriedout. The Millennium Development Goals must bereached”.My country  the survival of which is threatened byclimate change  therefore remains concerned overinaction and indifference with regard to theimplementation of the plans of action forenvironmental protection and sustainable development.Turning to another issue  we have beenwitnessing an unprecedented deterioration of thesituation in Palestine and the Middle East. The IsraeliGovernment has killed the peace process and hasdriven the region to the brink of war. Its acts ofaggression and the use of excessive force  coupled withpolitical assassinations  the destruction of vitalinstallations and infrastructure  blockades andeconomic suffocation of the Palestinian people  are alldesigned to frustrate the prospects for an independentPalestinian State. We condemn these dastardly actionsand call on the international community to persuadeIsrael to withdraw from all occupied Palestinianterritories and to respect all relevant Security Councilresolutions. The Maldives has consistently supportedthe just struggle of the Palestinian people to regaintheir inalienable rights and to establish an independentPalestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital.We believe that the United Nations has animportant role to play in bringing the two sides back tothe negotiating table. We recognize the efforts of theQuartet  and encourage its members  especially theUnited States  to remain actively engaged in the searchfor a just  permanent and lasting peace in the region.Disarmament and arms control measures shouldremain a high priority on the international agenda. Theinternational community must unite and actcollectively to strengthen and enforce the non-proliferation regimes. The Maldives is party to allmajor multilateral instruments relating to arms controland disarmament  including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We call onthose countries that are not party to those instrumentsto accede to them as soon as possible. Furthermore  mycountry believes that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace in various partsof the world can contribute immensely to the efforts ofthe international community in this regard.6As well  we should vigorously pursue our effortsand enforce verifiable measures to rid the world ofbiological and chemical weapons that can cause massdestruction. My country  therefore  believes thatbilateral  regional and multilateral approaches must bereinforced and that they must complement one anotherif we are to free the world of those deadly weapons. Webelieve also that  on global issues  there should be asincere commitment to multilateralism and trust in themultilateral institutions. The United Nations must notonly be placed at the centre of multilateral processes but should remain the principal player responsible forgrappling with these important global issues  whichhave such a great bearing on international peace andsecurity.In conclusion  allow me to reiterate the firmcommitment of the Maldives to the principles andpurposes enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations. We firmly believe that the United Nationsrequires reform and restructuring. The aim of thereform process should be the enhancement of thecredibility  legitimacy and universal character of theO1rganization. This involves the reform of the SecurityCouncil  a new working relationship  and a strongenforcement regime within the United Nations andamong its Member States.Together with other members of the internationalcommunity  the Maldives will work to uphold andpromote the objectives of the United Nations. Weremain convinced that the United Nations is the onlyorganization that is capable of creating a more peacefuland prosperous world for humanity."
"110",4538,"MEX",57,2002,"﻿Mexico wishes to welcome two new Member States.Their presence buttresses the universal mission of theUnited Nations. Our congratulations to the DemocraticRepublic of Timor-Leste. This represents a furtherexpression of the right to self-determination and areflection of its people's resolve for independence.Also  we welcome the decision of the people of theSwiss Confederation to become a full Member of theUnited Nations.The international community is facing a definingmoment. A year after the attack on the United States  inwhich men and women from more than 80 differentcountries perished  we have the responsibility to decidetogether the direction the international system shouldtake in the coming years.Mexico is aware of the magnitude of thechallenges that the Organization faces today: theurgency of returning a human focus to globalization  offighting the poverty that divides the world  of makingpossible development that respects the environment  offinding formulas for resolving the many conflicts andwars that now affect millions of people  of effectivelyfighting international terrorism and of guaranteeingrespect for the rights and fundamental freedoms ofevery human being.Responding to those challenges in a responsibleand visionary way is more important today than everbefore. At the present time  anger or the inevitabledifficulties of consensus-building may cloud judgementor give rise to pressure to act precipitously orunilaterally. Mexico is convinced that  at this time  theonly legitimate path of action is that based on a23multilateral approach that favours agreement andcollective action  for the benefit of the internationalcommunity as a whole as well as of each our nationsindividually. Therefore  Mexico reaffirms itscommitment to the system of international security thatgives the Security Council the responsibility ofmaintaining world peace. In fulfilling that mandate  theCouncil must base its actions on the principlesarticulated in the Charter of the United Nations  such asthe peaceful settlement of disputes  which has been afundamental aspiration of the community of nationssince the middle of the last century and is one of mycountry's most cherished ideals.Mexico maintains that the Security Council is theproper body to adopt the measures necessary to achievea lasting solution to the question of Iraq. Therefore  wevalue the statement made yesterday by PresidentGeorge Bush  which included a recognition of theimportance that debate and collective decision-makingwill have in the coming days and weeks in determiningthe path to be taken concerning Iraq. However  wecannot fail to recognize that the scope of action open tous will also involve complex challenges for Councilmembers and for the entire international community.We unequivocally condemn  as have most othernations  Iraq's continued non-compliance withCouncil resolutions concerning disarmament and therenunciation of weapons of mass destruction  and wereaffirm the importance of that nation's immediatecompliance  without preconditions  with Councilresolutions concerning the return of United Nationsinspectors. Nevertheless  we must recognize that non-compliance with United Nations resolutions hasoccurred at other junctures  at other times and in otherplaces.Today  we believe it is indispensable that theSecurity Council have the necessary time and supportto seek the return of the inspectors  and we thereforesupport President Jacques Chirac's recent proposal toset a specific time frame for meeting that objective.Moreover  as a responsible and committed Councilmember  Mexico believes that any decision arisingfrom possible Iraqi non-compliance with the relevantresolutions should be taken based on two indispensableconditions. First  there must be a clearer evaluation ofIraq's true weapons capacity  including bothtechnology and delivery systems  and of its intentionto use them or the capacity of terrorist groups to gainaccess to them. It could be based on reports issued byUnited Nations inspection mechanisms  with additionalinformation from individual countries. Secondly  theremust be agreement among Council member  as well asother countries directly involved  on the steps that mustbe taken in the light of the corroboration of those factsor in the event of Iraq's refusal to permit the return ofinspectors to its territory.Mexico believes that unilateral military action taken without prior consultation with the SecurityCouncil  would undermine the foundations of the newarchitecture of international security and could affectthe consensus in favour of the battle againstinternational terrorism that followed the attacksperpetrated a year ago against the United States.Mexico comes before the Assembly with thedetermination to assume an active role in building anew world order. Its willingness for dialogue withother nations is a reflection of the democratic changethat has occurred in my country  which has also givenMexico new confidence in its ability to contribute toattaining the objectives of the international community.The determination to play a more active role in theworld has led us to incorporate issues and perspectiveswith global dimensions and impact as key elements ofour national interests. Fostering world economicdevelopment  promoting and defending human rightsand strengthening democracy and sustainabledevelopment are examples of our commitment  whichtranscends borders and sovereignties. The efforts thatwe undertake to make global ideals reality will alsoenable us to promote more vigorously our nationalvalues.Mexico's redoubled international activity hasbeen reflected over the past months in a series ofactions that mark a milestone in the history of ourforeign relations. One of our projects with greateststrategic vision is the Puebla-Panama Plan  whoseobjective is to coordinate the efforts of the public social and private sectors of Mexico and of the CentralAmerican countries in implementing joint developmentand investment projects.With the same determination  we are promoting asense of community in North America in order toarticulate shared values towards a common vision ofregional development that is coherent  wide-rangingand long-term. In that context  we believe that thegradual negotiation of an immigration agreement tobring order and legality to the movement of labour in24the region is an urgent priority. From Mexico'sstandpoint  labour flows between countries must beviewed as an opportunity to redirect the globalizationprocess and to reduce the gap that separates developednations from less-developed societies.My country has also launched an extensivecampaign of cultural promotion abroad. In that way Mexico is seeking to present to the world the wealth diversity and vitality of its culture in order to buildbridges with other nations and regions. Thestrengthening of cooperation and cultural ties amongour countries must be a priority for us all. That is whywe welcome the return of the United States to theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization.The international activism displayed by Mexicofor almost two years now has been particularly evidentin more intense work within multilateral forums. Incarrying out that work  we have often been able tobuild on the foundations established by previousAdministrations. But there is undoubtedly a new spiritand a new purpose in the role that multilateral activismplays in Mexico's international strategy.Our most important task in the multilateral spherelies here within the United Nations. The Governmentof Mexico is proud to have received the support of thecommunity of nations for our country's election as anon-permanent member of the Security Council. In thatand other forums  we are actively participating in thebuilding of a new international architecture that willgovern relations among nations in the coming decades.Mexico's participation in the Asia-PacificEconomic Cooperation forum  in which we haveparticipated since 1993  is another eloquent exampleof our international activism. In October  our countrywill host the tenth meeting of the leaders of thatmechanism  where we shall continue to promoteactions that foster greater prosperity for the peoples ofthe Asia-Pacific region.Mexico has also vigorously promoted therelaunching of international economic negotiations.The International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  held in March at Monterrey  promoted abroad and inclusive alliance among States andinternational organizations that should make possible ahigher level of financing for development  with a clearbalance between national responsibilities andinternational cooperation. Today  the MonterreyConsensus is the basis for redirecting globalizationtowards growth and anti-poverty objectives  and it isthe ideal tool for placing development priorities at thecentre of the international agenda.From Mexico's standpoint  the MonterreyConference forms part of a coherent series ofinternational summits devoted to promoting the agendaof world development. That process began last year inDoha with the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the WorldTrade Organization (WTO); it grew in strength byincorporating the environmental dimension ofsustainable development in Johannesburg  and it willcontinue with the holding of the Fifth MinisterialMeeting of the WTO in Canc˙n  Mexico  next year.The close interrelationship among all the issues relatedto development was also apparent at the recentJohannesburg Summit  where the positions thatPresident Vicente Fox put forward on behalf of Mexicowere widely supported and recognized.Mindful of the new threats to internationalsecurity  the Mexican Government has also called forthe security arrangements of the Americas to beupdated. We have offered to host a special conferenceon security to be convened at the third Summit of theAmericas  to take place in Mexico in May 2003.Notwithstanding the importance of all theseactions  Mexico's new role at the international level isparticularly evident in our promotion of human rightsand democracy. My country has stated its convictionthat human rights represent absolute and universalvalues and that  as such  the obligation to uphold themis a duty shared by all Governments and peoples irrespective of borders and sovereignties. Moreover  wehave been consistent in these convictions. That is why despite the mixed reaction that it has generated inMexico  given the strong bonds of friendship thatMexican society has always enjoyed with severalnations close to us  we have been compelled to expressour concern about the human rights situation in thosecountries. One of the most far-reaching steps we havetaken to demonstrate our commitment to the cause ofhuman rights is the harmonization of Mexicanlegislation with international instruments that protectsuch rights. We have placed particular emphasis on theprotection of such vulnerable groups as women children  indigenous peoples and the disabled.At the same time  we have abandoned thedefensive attitude that prevented us from entering into25dialogue with other nations and multilateralorganizations dedicated to the protection of humanrights. Upon the invitation of the MexicanGovernment  many representatives of internationalhuman rights organizations have visited our country. Inthe same spirit of openness  the Mexican Governmentsigned a framework agreement with the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.In the context of efforts of the MexicanGovernment to strengthen the rule of law  the MexicanSenate is currently considering a draft constitutionalamendment that would allow our country to ratify theRome Statute creating the International Criminal Court.This amendment would involve recognition of thejurisdiction of international courts created by treaties towhich Mexico is party and ensure compliance withtheir resolutions and rulings. The amendmentrepresents a decisive step towards incorporating andensuring the effectiveness of the standards ofinternational law at the domestic level. Mexicowelcomes the recent entry into force of theInternational Criminal Court  which reflects the resolveof the community of nations to create an internationalsystem based on universal standards.We believe  however  that the signing ofagreements by those seeking to prevent a givencategory of persons from being subject to thejurisdiction of the International Criminal Courtrepresents a grave step backwards for international law.It threatens the universal scope of the provisions of theRome Statute  distorts the spirit that led to its creationand undermines the efforts of the community of Statesto eliminate impunity in the cases of extremely seriouscrimes. We appeal to the members of the internationalcommunity to assist in strengthening the authority ofthe International Criminal Court  which it has spent somuch time and effort to build.The defence of human rights necessarily involvesthe promotion of democratic freedoms. Today  we areseeing increasingly widespread recognition of the factthat representative democracy  with its institutionalframework of parties  groups and civil societyorganizations  as well as the legal frameworksafeguarding the civil freedoms of association andspeech  constitutes the best way of reconciling thelegitimate exercise of authority with respect to thosefreedoms that are essential to human beings. Mexico'sactive part in drafting the Inter-American DemocraticCharter  which was signed by the nations of theAmerican continent in September 2001  is anotherexample of my country's commitment to democraticprinciples. At the same  we are successfully promotingdemocratic values in other regions  as demonstrated byour work within the Community of Democracies whose second conference is scheduled to be held inNovember.The adherence of the Mexican Government andMexican society to human rights and democracy hastwo mutually complementary aspects. On the one hand it means strengthening democratic practices andinstitutions and human rights throughout the country  towhich end we are restoring the effectiveness of the ruleof law; on the other  it compels us to engage in morevigorous activism in international forums so that wemay encourage full respect for human rights anddemocracy throughout the world. This will enable usmore firmly to consolidate human rights anddemocracy in Mexico  so that the democratic changethat we have experienced can become irreversible.I am here today to state that my country hasreturned with renewed energy to the internationalscene. The Mexican Government has moved fromdefensive aloofness to constructive dialogue  and fromlimited international legitimacy to the exercise ofdiplomacy based on democratic principles andunqualified respect for human rights. The kind of worldwe wish to create and the steps we are willing totake  or to refrain from taking  in order to achieveit are questions that we cannot evade at this criticalmoment of international redefinition. Mexico reaffirmsits conviction that action based on principles andagreements must take precedence over the temptationsof unilateralism and that universal standards mustprevail over short-term interests. Mexico'sinternational activism  in particular its commitment tohuman rights and democracy  reflects the belief of theMexican nation in the essential equality of all humanbeings and in the duties that it entails for all ourpeoples and Governments."
"111",4563,"MHL",57,2002,"﻿I bring to theAssembly warm greetings from President Kessai H.Note.On behalf of the Republic of the MarshallIslands  I am honoured to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavanon his election to this high office. Let me also take thisopportunity to thank the Secretary-General for the hardwork that he and the Secretariat have undertaken inpreparation for this General Assembly.I am also very pleased to extend a warm welcomeand congratulations from the Marshall Islands to thepeople of Switzerland and of East Timor  as the newestMembers of the United Nations.It is unfortunate that this  the fifty-seventhsession of the General Assembly  is meeting in theshadow of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks thatshocked our host country — and the world — on 11September 2001. Modern terrorism is an issue ofconcern for all peoples  regardless of nationality orreligion. It is an issue that no nation can afford toignore.While sharing in the feelings of terror  horror andsorrow caused by the terrorist attacks in the UnitedStates  the people of the Marshall Islands are hopefulthat the Member States of the United Nations willcontinue to join together in working towards globalpeace and security. I urge this body  which collectivelyrepresents the moral force of all Member States  to doeverything in its power to eliminate the threat ofterrorism.I am pleased to announce that the MarshallIslands has recently completed a process of nationalpriority-setting and of assessing Government policy.We have thoroughly reviewed the state of our nationthrough the holding of a National Economic and SocialSummit  whose findings have formed the basis for ourlong-term sustainable development plan  entitled“Republic of the Marshall Islands Vision 2018”.This process of review was guided byconsultations with all stakeholders and all sectors ofour society. Extensive discussions and interviews werecarried out in order to ensure that all members of theMarshall Islands community would have theopportunity to contribute to our vision for the future.The Marshall Islands Government has determinedthat all development policies and objectives will beguided by the vision generated by the Summit  and weare now in the process of implementing the core idealsof this blueprint for sustainable development.In developing our national vision  the MarshallIslands Government has also responded to theinternational agenda as set by the United Nations. Wehave ensured that our policies will reflect the all-important priorities of good governance  respect forfundamental human rights  protection of theenvironment  and conservation of natural resources. Wehave also taken account of social developmentobjectives and of the need to invest in the areas ofhealth and education. We are confident that  by linkingour national priorities to the international agenda  thecorrect policy decisions will be made.During the 1990s the Marshall Islands wentthrough a period of structural adjustment and reform atthe demand of the international donor community. Wehave faithfully carried out these costly and sociallydisruptive reforms  in the hope that some form ofreward would be forthcoming. We now have in place aforward-looking and pragmatic set of policies  and weare eager to translate them into action for thebetterment of the lives of our people. Yet there are fewwho are willing to assist us in achieving this goal.I therefore stand here  at the fifty-seventh sessionof the General Assembly  to advocate for a newinternational paradigm: one that recognizes both theunique challenges facing small island developingStates such as the Marshall Islands  as well as theunique resources and gifts that such nations possess —resources that can benefit the whole of the internationalcommunity only through substantive and sustainedpartnerships.It is time to reconceptualize the relationship thatexists between more established and less-establishednations  from one of donors and recipients to one ofmutual beneficiaries and collaborators. Only in thisway will it be possible fully to realize the promise oftrue international cooperation and development.The Marshall Islands has so much in the way ofnative intellectual  environmental and culturalresources to share with the international community.We look forward to creating new forms of partnershipwith entities around the world — partnerships that willredound to the benefit of the global community and ofall its residents.30The partnerships that are most meaningful to usare ones of a practical nature. Our communities  andthose of many other nations like the Marshall Islands are seeking partnerships of action that offer pragmaticand practical solutions that are coordinated andtargeted for maximum effect.The Marshall Islands shares challenges that areuniquely peculiar to many small island States: aprecariously fragile environment that is highlysensitive to the threat posed by global warming; anarrow economic base that imposes constraints on thepotential for progressive and sustainable development;and an institutional milieu that is slowly developing thecapability of harnessing the benefits of science andtechnology.In relation to our international partners  theMarshall Islands is particularly concerned about thefollowing issues. First of all  we are concerned aboutthe environment. The Marshall Islands Governmentrecognizes the need for a coordinated andcomprehensive approach in seeking appropriatesolutions to the challenges posed by environmentaldegradation and pollution.We commend the Barbados Programme ofAction  which  in conjunction with the outcome forgedat the Johannesburg Earth Summit  will provide aguiding framework for sustainable development forsmall island States  such as the Marshall Islands. Thewide divergence of views expressed in Johannesburgposed many challenges  but also produced rich insightsinto areas where our common strengths lie  and intohow these might best be utilized.Further  it is vital that the internationalcommunity recognize the great challenge to life andculture that is posed by global climate change. Thisthreat to life and culture is felt most acutely by nationssuch as the Marshall Islands — nations that face thevery real threat of complete obliteration if our oceansrise by even marginal levels.On behalf of the Marshall Islands  I commendthose States that share our concerns and have signedand ratified the Kyoto Protocol. May I also urge theremaining non-signatory States to consider the vitalimportance and urgency of this issue. If theinternational community does not act now  the futurewill see the disappearance of many small islandnations  which in turn will have immeasurableeconomic  environmental and immigrationconsequences for the entire global community.Secondly  an issue that is particularly relevant tothe Marshall Islands is that of nuclear cleanup and non-proliferation. The Marshall Islands seeks partnershipswith members of the international community that willhelp raise to new levels the dialogue about nuclearweapons and their testing.The people of the Marshall Islands have sufferedgreatly at the hands of a world that is continuallypreparing for war. We are restrained by the persistinglegacy of toxic nuclear waste  which poses challengesfar beyond our financial and scientific capability tosolve. Our food chain continues to be affected  and ourdevelopment is thwarted by our inability to usedamaged lands.I am pleased to state that the United StatesCongress is currently reviewing our situation  and weare hopeful that the outcome will contribute towardsamelioration of this problem. Nevertheless  we believethat our hard-learned lessons can help to inform andinstruct the international community in future debatesabout the use and testing of nuclear weapons.And thirdly  another issue that is particularlypertinent for our people is that of oceans and fisheries.As a nation whose entire livelihood depends on theresources of the sea  the Marshall Islands Governmentpledges its unwavering support for the Law of the Seamanagement regime. In particular  we emphasize theimportance of Article 63 (1) of the Convention  whichspeaks of the need for States to agree on measuresnecessary to coordinate and ensure the conservationand development of shared stocks.The Marshall Islands is also pursuing theestablishment of national fisheries industries that willgradually enable the replacement of foreign fishingfleets; the delineation of our own exclusive economiczone; and the establishment of international guidelinesto protect our oceans for generations of futurefishermen and the people who count on the work theydo for survival.I have mentioned only a few of the priorities thatmy delegation will be seeking to raise at theappropriate moment in the upcoming committeedebates and in our interactions with United Nationsagencies and our development partners. There are  ofcourse  many other issues of concern to both the31Marshall Islands and the international community as awhole — issues with which all of us will wrestle in thecoming years.Among the most important challenges faced bythis body is the continued exclusion of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan from the United Nations. TheMarshall Islands Government reiterates its concern thatthe exclusion of a nation of peaceful and law-abidingcitizens is not consistent with the inclusive ideal of theUnited Nations. I therefore urge each and every one ofyou  all of us  to overcome our biases and to allow theadmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan to theUnited Nations.Another important challenge faced by this body isthe ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The MarshallIslands considers that urgent diplomatic action isrequired in order to work towards a peaceful solutionto this threat to international peace and security.The Marshall Islands wishes to emphasize itssupport for the expansion of the United NationsSecurity Council. We believe that there should be anincrease in the number of both permanent and non-permanent members of the Council and that suchexpansion should include members from bothdeveloped and developing countries. This wouldsignificantly broaden the representation base of theCouncil and thus reinforce its ongoing validity.May I take this opportunity to congratulate theinternational community on its support for the newly-established International Criminal Court. The MarshallIslands is hopeful and confident that the Court willprove to be a powerful mechanism in theadministration of justice at the international level. Weare  however  currently considering the making of abilateral agreement under Article 98 of the RomeStatute and will determine this issue after a carefulassessment of the implications of such an agreement.Finally  I wish to reaffirm the strong commitmentin fellowship and solidarity of the Marshall Islandswith all the Member States of this body.Long live the United Nations. God bless theUnited Nations."
"112",4587,"MKD",57,2002,"﻿At the outset  allow me to congratulateMr. Jan Kavan on his election to the most prestigiouspost of President of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. My delegation is fully confidentthat his skilful leadership will bring success to thissession.I wish to avail myself of this opportunity also tocongratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of Korea  for his tireless effortsand dedication in performing his duties.The United Nations community has recentlybecome richer with the admission to its membership ofthe Swiss Confederation. Though the valuablecontribution of that country to the goals of the UnitedNations was undisputed even before its formalmembership  I congratulate the Swiss Federation onthis decision. We are also looking forward to EastTimor's joining the Organization  which will take placesoon.The heinous acts of 11 September 2001  whichstruck New York  Washington and Pennsylvania  havebrought the international community to a criticaljuncture  where it is faced with an ultimate challenge:how to find a way to successfully cope with theindiscriminate effects and devastating consequences ofacts of international terrorism.18The promptness with which the world reacted andthe solidarity expressed through the broadest coalitionever against terrorism was exemplary. The UnitedNations took the lead in combating internationalterrorism. The Republic of Macedonia  itself a victimof terrorist aggression  has joined the internationalcoalition and is making its contribution to this end.Two days ago  on Sunday  15 September  mycountry held  for the fourth time  free and democraticelections. They marked the progress achieved over thepast year  and the fact that they went smoothlyreaffirmed our commitment to democracy and to therule of law. They also reaffirmed the maturity ofMacedonian society  its Government and its citizens thus once again establishing its position as an equaland respected member of the European family.Our elections  an outstanding democraticachievement  are clear proof that all alongMacedonia has been seeking political and democraticsolutions. They represent an outstanding example ofthe fact that democracy  elections and political freedomare the most effective mechanisms for a society and itsneeds  and the most efficient answer to violence as aninstrument for achieving political goals.Terrorism has more than once proved itself notonly an unworthy ally  but also a dangerousbedfellow  one that always turns against those whouse it in their pursuit of social change or justice.Therefore  there must be no double standardswhen dealing with political extremism and terrorism because  as we have proved  there is not one issue thatcannot be dealt with politically  or  better yet  throughelections and dialogue  as we have done.The crises in recent history have shown moreclearly than ever the importance of cooperation andsolidarity among the countries of our region  as well asthe importance of developing regional collectivesecurity mechanisms in South-eastern Europe.Macedonia  for its part  is making every effort to makeits contribution to strengthening cooperation withinvarious regional organizations and initiatives. Furtherimprovement of good-neighbourly relations remainsone of the priorities of the foreign policy of theRepublic of Macedonia.Allow me in this context to reiterate our firmstance as to the need for the full implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999) concerningKosovo. The Republic of Macedonia has providedcontinuous support for the efforts of the internationalcommunity and has always met the requests of theUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission inKosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR in regard to thesuccessful fulfilment of their mandate. We support theUNMIK policy of benchmarks' and believe that itwill facilitate the building of a democratic  multi-ethnicsociety and strengthen the rule of law in Kosovo.Let me recall here the agreement on delineationand demarcation of the border between the Republic ofMacedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia whose implementation on the ground is to start soon.At this point  let me stress that efforts aimed atundermining the validity of the Agreement  such as theones we witnessed early this year by the local self-government and Assembly of Kosovo  should bedefinitively rejected and nullified. In that sense  wesupport the reaction of the Security Council  whichdetermined that this action was null and void.There are still many challenges ahead of us in theregion. All of our goodwill and efforts to providesustainable stability will not yield results unless weseriously address the real problems present in theregion as a consequence of 10 years of wars andinstability. Organized crime  various forms oftrafficking in drugs  arms  human beings and so on which most often spur extremism and terrorism  havenot been adequately taken into account. Nationalmeasures do not suffice to eliminate these phenomena.Strong involvement and support on the part of theinternational community is also indispensable.Allow me to inform the Assembly that theRepublic of Macedonia will once again this yearsubmit a draft resolution on the maintenance ofinternational security  good-neighbourliness  stabilityand development in South-eastern Europe. The draftresolution addresses the complexity of the problems ofdisarmament  stability and development in this region.The combat against terrorism must not distract usfrom other important issues on the United Nationsagenda. The Millennium Summit and the Secretary-General's road map towards the implementation of theUnited Nations Millennium Declaration have bothidentified the direction of future United Nationsactivities  to which we commit ourselves: theeradication of poverty  the struggle against AIDS conflict prevention and protection of the environment.19The draft resolution will address the complexity of theproblems of disarmament  stability and development inthis region.The struggle against terrorism must not detractfrom other important issues on the United Nationsagenda. The Millennium Summit and the Secretary-General's road map towards the implementation of theUnited Nations Millennium Declaration (A/56/326) gohand in hand in identifying the direction of futureUnited Nations activities  to which we commitourselves: the eradication of poverty  the struggleagainst HIV/AIDS  conflict prevention and theprotection of the environment.Globalization remains one of the most importantissues on the international agenda. It is obvious thatthere are some essential problems that need to beaddressed immediately. In the new millennium  it iscrucial that the international community address thedevelopment agenda in a more comprehensive way andimprove the status of the protection of and respect forother fundamental human rights and freedoms. In thatcontext  the implementation of the goals set at theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment and at the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  together with the special session onchildren  the most important events of the UnitedNations this year  require the strong political willand commitment of Member States during theforthcoming review period. In that regard  I wish to usethis opportunity to welcome the United NationsDeclaration on the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment adopted yesterday by the GeneralAssembly as resolution 57/2.There is a need to build stronger partnershipswith other relevant organizations beyond the UnitedNations system  such as the World Trade Organization(WTO)  the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund  as well as with the businesscommunity  non-governmental organizations andothers  in order for them to be closely engaged in theprocess. The fact that every fourth State Member of ourOrganization is classified as least developed iscertainly no credit to any of us. That is why this issuemust be given the highest priority.On disarmament matters  while the UnitedNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons in All its Aspects and the adoptedProgramme of Action marked a significant first step atthe global level towards preventing  combating anderadicating the illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons  we believe that there is a need for anenhanced follow-up process. The problem of smallarms and proliferation has been a particular concern ofthe Republic of Macedonia and the broader region. Itposes a serious threat not only to my country's securityand stability  but also to the region at large. Therefore it is necessary to take strong action to combat the illicitflow of small arms and light weapons.Strengthening the role and relevance of ourOrganization should remain a topical issue on theUnited Nations agenda. Additional efforts should bemade particularly to strengthen United Nationspreventive and peacekeeping capacities.Making progress on issues of equitablerepresentation and reform of the Security Council is noless important. We are looking forward to thedeliberations this year of the Open-ended WorkingGroup  aimed at achieving meaningful progresstowards making the Security Council morerepresentative and transparent  while preserving andimproving its effectiveness for the maintenance ofinternational peace and stability.The Republic of Macedonia has from the verybeginning been a strong supporter of the establishmentof the International Criminal Court (ICC) and was oneof the first 60 States to ratify the Rome Statute  whichentered into force on 1 July 2002. We support theefforts of the ICC to become truly universal  whilebelieving that the concerns expressed regarding thepossibility of politically motivated prosecutions can beaddressed in a way that will not compromise the spiritof the Court.The world today faces new challenges.Undoubtedly  the most important is the redefinition ofthe very essence of international relations. That effortto instil new values is questioned by regimes and rogueleaders who belong to the past and who  contradictingprogress  have survived.We are  at this moment  all mesmerized by thedevelopment of events surrounding Iraq and the MiddleEast as a whole. Problems like these demand solutions.Many measures are being considered today  but theymust be based on a common conviction that our maintask is to construct a new and better world and thatthese extraordinary steps are not our primary goal.20Therefore  it is the firm conviction of theRepublic of Macedonia that our most important toolsmust be dialogue and mutual understanding. We knowthat very well. The Republic of Macedonia  being atthe heart of the Balkans and of South-Eastern Europe where over centuries various cultures and civilizationshave left many traces  where Christianity and Islamhave struggled for dominance and where ethnicitieshave become interwoven  had every reason tosupport the proclamation of 2001 as the United NationsYear of Dialogue among Civilizations. As a follow-upand a practical contribution implementing the GlobalAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations  theRepublic of Macedonia will host in November of thisyear  in Ohrid  a World Heritage city of the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization  a regional forum on dialogue amongcivilizations  the first gathering of that kind in theregion of South-Eastern Europe."
"113",4633,"MLI",57,2002,"﻿At theoutset  I should like to tell you  Sir  how pleased mydelegation is to see you presiding over the work of thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. To yourpredecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  I should also like toexpress my sincere and warm congratulations on thecompetence  devotion and authority with which heguided the work of the fifty-sixth session.I should also like to express again to Mr. KofiAnnan  Secretary-General of the Organization  thewarm congratulations and profound gratitude of theGovernment of Mali for the effectiveness and wisdomhe has shown in managing the concerns of theinternational community in a particularly difficultcontext. I take this opportunity to reiterate to theSecretary-General the thanks of His Excellency Mr.Amadou Toumani Touré  President of the Republic ofMali  for the confidence that the Secretary-General hasplaced in him in seeking solutions to certain conflictsthat are shaking Africa. He expresses Mali ‘s readinessto continue to work for the preservation of internationalpeace and security  particularly in Africa.Mali wishes to welcome to the OrganizationSwitzerland and Timor-Leste  whose admissionstrengthens the universal character of the UnitedNations.The fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly is opening in an international contextmarked by the persistence of areas of tension  ofdevelopment inequalities and of growing povertyamong the peoples in developing countries  of the sadconsequences of globalization  of natural disasters andof the extremely difficult consequences of the terroristattacks of 11 September 2001  whose first anniversarythe international community has just commemorated.At the time  Mali vigorously condemned those attacks which nothing can justify. Since then  it hasparticipated in the great international campaign of thefight against terrorism. In so doing  it has ratified allinternational legal instruments related to the fightagainst terrorism. Likewise  important means andmechanisms have been put in place so that Mali ‘snational territory cannot be used for the preparation orperpetration of terrorist acts.In order to meet the terrorist threat  it is importantthat the international community strengthencooperation among its members. Furthermore  Malicalls for integrated and sustained global action  inwhich the United Nations should play the premier role.It reiterates the appeal of Africa  of the Non-AlignedMovement and of the Organization of the Islamic2Conference for the holding of an internationalconference under the auspices of the United Nationsaimed at swiftly concluding a universally acceptedlegal instrument on international terrorism.In Mali  the year 2002 was devoted to theholding  for the third time  of pluralistic  democraticand peaceful elections  at the outcome of which HisExcellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré assumed thecountry ‘s highest post. Those elections are sufficientproof that Mali ‘s democratic institutions have takenroot  and they support the democratic culture of theMalian people.Here  I must express  on behalf of the people andthe Government of Mali  my heartfelt thanks to all ourpartners for their contribution to the organization  theholding and  the success of those elections. Mali isdeeply attached to the consolidation of the rule of law to the preservation of peace and security and to theimprovement of the living conditions of populations. Inthat regard  our conviction remains that we mustdeepen  promote and respect those values.For Mali  republican and democratic institutionsmust be renewed only through democratic institutionalmechanisms that have been established in advance. Thestrengthening of good governance  the consolidation ofthe democratic process  food security  the improvementof the educational and health systems  the organizationand effective functioning of justice  actions to promotechildren and women  and the fight against poverty andcorruption are  inter alia  the challenges to which thenew Government of Mali is committed to face.Likewise  as part of its policy of economic andsocial development  Mali is working  with the help ofits development partners  to implement macroeconomicreforms designed to re-launch the process of growthand development.Mali is resolutely determined to guaranteeindividual security in all its dimensions. That why mycountry is a full-fledged member of the HumanSecurity Network. It fully agrees that there is a need toharmonize efforts with regard to the destruction of anti-personnel landmines and the fight against the illicittrade in and the proliferation of small arms and lightweapons  with a view to adopting a United Nationsprogramme of action to reduce the human sufferingcaused by those scourges.Stability  peace and security are prerequisites forany process of true development in Africa. Despite thesignificant progress made in resolving certain Africanconflicts  our continent continues to be faced with anumber of ongoing problems  including debt  thecontinuing fall in the price of raw materials  thedemocratic deficit  the HIV/AIDS pandemic  malariaand difficulties related to humanitarian assistance.Those issues constitute a serious impediment todevelopment efforts in Africa.Mali welcomes the fact that the long fratricidalconflict in Angola has come to an end and pays a well-deserved tribute to the people and the leaders ofAngola for the courage that they have shown and theefforts that they are continuing to make to consolidatepeace and bring about national reconciliation.I should like to take this opportunity to paytribute to the United Nations for its valuablecontribution to the search for a resolution of theAngolan conflict.I should also like to pay tribute to my compatriot the late Alioune Blondin Beye  a talented diplomat whowas the Special Representative of theSecretary-General for Angola from 1994 until the timeof his death in June 1998. Alioune Blondin Beye madethe supreme sacrifice on behalf of peace in Angola.The recent signing of a peace agreement betweenthe main parties to the conflict in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo is a further reason for hope.These glimmers of hope for conflict management onthe continent will require intense support from theinternational community  which must provide furthersupport for Africa's efforts through in the form ofresources and mechanisms that are capable ofproviding security and promoting development stability and peace.The launching of the African Union  which hasreplaced the Organization of African Unity  certainlyrepresents the most decisive historic and political eventon the African continent this year. The African Unionwill enable the continent to plan for its future moreclearly  take responsibility for its own development prevent and manage conflict and promote partnershipand international cooperation that is better adapted tothe expectations of the population.The recent adoption at Durban of the ProtocolRelating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security3Council of the African Union  a standing decision-making body for conflict management and resolution inAfrica  represents an important step forward in thesetting up of a collective rapid-reaction security systemdesigned to facilitate an appropriate and effectiveregional response in dealing with conflict situationsand crises in Africa. It is also the appropriate tool tobolster the efforts of the Security Council in fulfillingits main responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  in particularly inAfrica. Mali has already begun to take the necessarymeasures to ratify that important instrument.The New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD) also deserves ongoing support from theinternational community. Indeed  NEPAD offers theinternational community a historic opportunity toestablish a credible partnership with Africa — apartnership founded on shared responsibility.Mali remains deeply concerned about thedramatic developments of the situation in the MiddleEast. The responsibility of the international communityin dealing with that situation remains a commitmentaimed at a global  just and lasting peace in the MiddleEast — a peace founded on Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and theprinciple of land for peace.The creation of a Palestinian State — the centralissue of the Middle East question — side by side withIsrael  within safe and internationally recognizedborders  in accordance with Security Council resolution1397 (2002)  would be the best guarantee of a just andlasting peace in the region.On a different subject  Mali accords priority tointernational cooperation on the basis of internationallaw in the search for a lasting solution to conflicts thatare of concern to the international community. Thisprinciple should apply to the handling of the Iraqiissue.The creation of the International Criminal Court whose Statute was adopted in Rome  will not onlymake it possible to bring to justice those who committhe most serious crimes that infringe on the dignity ofthe human person  but also will provide an instrumentof deterrence that contributes to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. In this respect  mycountry would like to reaffirm its full support for thefight against impunity and for full respect for humandignity.My country would like to appeal to thosecountries that have still not acceded to the Statute ofthe International Criminal Court to do so in order tostrengthen the legitimacy of that institution.We are faced with a number of economicproblems that are impeding the full growth of severalof our States. The globalization of the economy hascontributed greatly to a serious imbalance whose chiefvictims are the developing countries. It has led inparticular to the impoverishment of a large number ofpeople  to environmental degradation and to large-scalemigration.External debt is a heavy burden for poorcountries. The money used to service the debt has tocome from the meagre resources of those countries which seriously handicaps any attempt to re-launchgrowth and development. Despite the measures agreedto aimed at alleviating the debt burden for poorcountries and allowing access to the markets of thecountries of the North  the inequalities persist andpoverty continues to worsen.New measures designed to establish closer linksbetween debt- and poverty-reduction activities shouldcontinue. More flexible mechanisms need to be set up however  in order to mobilize and utilize the resourcesgenerated by the application of the Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Debt Initiative. In this respect  it ishighly desirable for the developed countries and theinternational financial institutions to envisage measurescapable of enabling the developing countries to movefurther towards sustainable development and to benefitfrom globalization. Fulfilling the developmentobjectives set forth in the Millennium Declarationwould bring that about.Mali warmly welcomes United Nations initiativesin support of the least developed countries  asexemplified by the Brussels Programme of Action. Mycountry welcomes the holding in March 2002 atMonterrey of the International Conference onFinancing for Development and  more recently  theJohannesburg World Summit on SustainableDevelopment.The conclusions and recommendations that cameout of those two important meetings reflect thedetermination of the international community tocommit itself in a resolute manner to achieving theobjectives contained in the Millennium Declaration.4The Government of Mali also encouragesinstitutions and Governments throughout the world toimplement the relevant provisions contained in theMadrid International Plan of Action on Ageing  since itis true that development policies and strategiesintended to reduce poverty must necessarily takeaccount of the problems of ageing.The democratization and restructuring of themain organs of the United Nations desired by theoverwhelming majority of Member States  wouldgreatly contribute to peace and security in the world. Inparticular  the democratization of the Security Council whose structure no longer reflects the realities oftoday's world  would reflect our commondetermination to make it a more effective  morelegitimate and more representative body.Our peoples are waiting. They are waiting for usto lead them forward towards rebirth in the newcentury  towards the building of a new world  rich indiversity  more just and more united."
"114",4674,"MLT",57,2002,"﻿Allow me to begin by offeringMr. Jan Kavan my Government's warm congratulationsas he assumes the presidency of the General Assembly.He has served the Czech Republic so well as ForeignMinister  and I have full faith in his ability to meet thenumerous challenges that the fifty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly will no doubt present. I assurehim of my delegation's full support in the execution ofhis duties.Allow me also to take this opportunity to expressmy appreciation to Mr. Han Seung-soo for the skill anddedication with which he served this body during thesession that has just come to a close.It gives the Government of Malta great pleasureto welcome the recent admission of the SwissConfederation to our family of nations. We lookforward to also welcoming among us the DemocraticRepublic of East Timor. Their addition serves to furtherstrengthen the trust and belief of all our nations thatdialogue within a multilateral context is bothworthwhile and irreplaceable.Over the past couple of weeks the internationalcommunity has been seized of the issue of sustainabledevelopment. Malta participated actively in the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  held in SouthAfrica  and although the Summit's very ambitiousobjectives could not all be reached  we are satisfiedthat a plan of action — the Plan of Implementation —with specific targets to tackle key developmentproblems has been adopted. Throughout thenegotiations  Malta worked closely with the EuropeanUnion to include concrete plans and targets in the planof action. As a result  the Summit agreed on a series ofcommitments in priority areas such as water andsanitation  desertification  energy and biodiversity. It isour hope that the plan of action will attract thenecessary additional resources that will make itsimplementation possible  thereby making sustainabledevelopment a reality for an ever-increasing proportionof humanity.When I had the honour to address the Assemblyat the last general debate  in November 2001  I pledgedmy Government's full support for the Franco-Germaninitiative against the reproductive cloning of humanbeings. As a sponsor of resolution 56/93  whichestablished the relevant Ad Hoc Committee  we havecarefully followed the deliberations within theCommittee on the philosophical  medical  legal andethical considerations associated with this pressingissue. This was a necessary debate which brought tothe fore the consensus that exists on the need to12respond to the challenges posed by scientists who areunable or unwilling to recognize the deep moralimplications of their actions  as well as the dangers thatthey may pose to mankind. The convergence ofpolitical will has now been manifested. The time istherefore ripe for the Ad Hoc Committee to be given aclear mandate to negotiate a convention on this matter.My Government will strive for the timely conclusion ofnegotiations in this regard  preferably before the end of2003. However  whether or not the internationalcommunity concludes such a convention beforeattempts at reproductive human cloning actuallymaterialize  it is imperative that  through internationalaction and national legislation  Member States denysafe haven to those scientists willing to defy theinternational community.Before this year is out we shall becommemorating the twentieth anniversary of theopening for signature of the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea. When  as a newlyindependent State  Malta called for the commencementof negotiations on such a convention  it was concernedwith the numerous unresolved issues of the rights andobligations of States with regard to seas and oceans and with the seeds of countless conflicts that theymight sow. It is today impossible to speculate on thenumber of occasions on which the legal certainties thatthe Convention brought about have helped to defuse dissipate or prevent altogether the scourge of conflictand war. It is the curse of international law in our timesto make the news headlines only when it fails  whilepassing unnoticed and unsung when it succeeds.We would do well to remain conscious of the rolethat international law  based on the multilateralprocess  plays in the prevention of conflict and theavoidance of threats to international security. That is tosay  we would do well to remember the role it plays inupholding the central mandate of the United Nationsitself. The role of the instruments of international law and in particular those such as the Convention on theLaw of the Sea  should be recognized for thecontribution they provide in that regard.United Nations Headquarters has just played hostto the historic first session of the Assembly of StatesParties to the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court. The complex changes to nationallegislation necessary to allow for Malta's ratification ofthe Rome Statute have now reached an advanced stageand are expected to be presented to Parliament in thecoming days  thus enabling Malta to formally depositits instrument of ratification very soon.The new International Criminal Court (ICC) hasits roots in the atrocities carried out during the lastcentury — not least those addressed at the Nurembergtrials. The ICC is thus a product of the lessons learnedover time and of the widespread political will that hasled to the creation of a credible deterrent to the would-be perpetrators of the most heinous crimes. The ICCthus provides an effective  competent and fair forumwhere those individuals may be tried. Theestablishment of the Court also represents a majorbreakthrough in international law and one which hasbecome more — and not less — crucial now thatterrorism has imposed itself high on our internationalagenda.The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 stillloom large in our memories. The anniversary of thattragedy has again filled our television screens withhorrific scenes of suffering and death. It has served toremind us of the resolve which is necessary in the faceof such horror. My Government has taken part in thefight against international terrorism with fulldetermination  and will continue to do so. This isevidenced not only by our thorough implementation ofthe international conventions on terrorism and theongoing process towards the implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) but also byever-tighter controls and scrutiny at our ports. Weundertake further to intensify our efforts in this field inorder to assist in the permanent eradication of terrorismin whatever shape or form.The continued turbulence in the Middle East alsocontinues to be a source of great concern to myGovernment. The cycle of violence that continues toengulf the region provides a confirmation  if ever onewere needed  that there is no purely military solution tothe conflict. The extrajudicial killings of Palestinians the deliberate destruction of the property andlivelihoods of innocent civilians and the subjection ofthe entire Palestinian population to collectivepunishment does not dim the wholly legitimateaspirations of the Palestinian people to a State of theirown.Likewise  the targeting of Israeli civilians insuicide bombings and other forms of destruction of thelives and property of innocent civilians does untold13harm to the cause the perpetrators of those crimesclaim to support.No cause  no argument and no justification canlegitimize these abhorrent acts by either party to theconflict.My Government looks on in anguish as a fence reminiscent of the Berlin wall  that most shameful ofsymbols of the twentieth century  slowly takes shape. Itis a harrowing reminder of how little mankind haslearned from the past  particularly if we look back tothe outbreak of violence in the region since September2000.Unjustified preconditions to the start of politicalnegotiations further hinder any progress in thediscussions on a two-State solution to the conflict.Negotiations  which must start without further delay must be built on the clear and plain language ofSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338(1973) and the principle of land for peace. The recentinitiative by the States members of the European Unionin presenting a road map for the Middle East whichoutlines a three-stage process leading to the creation ofa Palestinian State by 2005 provides a genuine basisfor taking negotiations forward. The internationalcommunity looks to the Quartet to advance in thatdirection with urgency.An issue which continues to persist in theMediterranean is the situation in Cyprus  which hasremained a cause of concern for more than 25 years.We earnestly hope that an early settlement of theCyprus question will be found and reiterate our fullsupport for efforts to find a solution on the basis of therelevant Security Council resolutions. The imminentaccession of Cyprus to the European Union shouldprovide the necessary impetus for the resolution of thislong-standing problem.Malta is encouraged by the efforts of theSecretary-General to engage the Organization in thequest to achieve a resolution to the situation withregard to Iraq before it deteriorates any further. MyGovernment calls upon the Iraqi Government tocomply with all its obligations under all the provisionsof relevant Security Council resolutions  in particularthose concerning disarmament with respect to weaponsof mass destruction. Iraq must meet its commitmentsand allow the re-entry of United Nations inspectorsinto its territory without any preconditions and asstipulated by the Security Council.The international community should spare noeffort in exploring all political and diplomatic optionsthat would or could assist in resolving the issue. Maltais in agreement with the Secretary-General that if Iraqfails to meet its obligations  the Security Council  asthe organ entrusted with the primary responsibility forthe maintenance of international peace and security must shoulder its responsibilities. The Security Councilhas to ensure compliance with its own resolutions inthe interest of the international rule of law.Malta's location at the centre of theMediterranean has provided us with opportunities fortrade and development  which we have been relativelysuccessful at exploiting in the interest of our island which is otherwise bereft of natural resources. Ourstrategic location is  however  now also the scene ofanother socio-economic phenomenon of a much lessencouraging nature. I speak here of the poverty dividethat cuts across the Mediterranean Sea.The countries of the Mediterranean littoral sharemuch in terms of history  culture and way of life.However the ever more apparent disparities of wealthcontinue to fuel the movement of thousands of peoplefrom the southern Mediterranean and further afield toentrust their lives and hopes into the hands ofunscrupulous individuals. These traffickers of humanbeings  willing to exploit misery and desperation  havelittle respect for human life and often abandon thewould-be immigrants to the elements once they havesecured their ill-gotten gains. My Government hasincreased the punishment meted out to those foundguilty of such heinous acts. We have also bolstered oursurveillance and rescue capability within our territorialwaters and are simultaneously seeking to providetreatment that is as humane as possible to the victimsthat land on our shores. These efforts have been made however  in the full knowledge that they deal morewith the symptoms of the phenomenon of humantrafficking than with its root causes.The imperative of narrowing the wealth divideacross the Mediterranean is one of the philosophicalcornerstones of the Euro-Med process  which exists tobring the European Union and 12 Mediterranean Statestogether on a number of issues of common concern.Malta has been an avid supporter of the process sinceits inception and looks forward to developing its rolefurther within this forum as a member of the EuropeanUnion in the near future.14My Government believes that the accession ofMalta to the European Union will serve to furtherenhance our capability to promote peace and prosperitywithin the Mediterranean  given our reputation as anhonest broker that can identify with both sides of theMediterranean.Inasmuch as this is the case  we also believe thatmembership in the Union will also serve to strengthenour own internal workings at all levels of society bringing prosperity to the Maltese both now and for theyears to come. Indeed  we believe that membership inthe European Union constitutes a natural progressionfor Malta  given our long-standing historical  culturaland political ties with the Union.The negotiations concerning membership that arecurrently under way are nearing completion  and welook forward to joining this union of like-mindedStates at its next enlargement  in line with the timelinesestablished at the Nice meeting of the EuropeanCouncil.Malta has always played a role on theinternational scene far in excess of its size. This weintend to continue  and I anticipate that all our effortswill combine with those of the other nations of theworld to bring about improvements in all the areas thaturgently call for our immediate attention. Thisunswerving determination will guide our efforts in thevarious forums of which we form part and in theactivities we undertake  as together we strive to make abetter and secure world for this and future generations.I wish the President every success in hisendeavours in presiding over the General Assembly."
"115",4720,"MMR",57,2002,"﻿At the outset  I would liketo take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavanon his assumption of the presidency of the fifty-seventhsession of the General Assembly. I am confident thathis diplomatic skill and expertise will bring us to asuccessful outcome. I would also like to express ourgratitude and appreciation to his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his leadership andvaluable contribution during the previous session.May I also use this occasion to warmly welcomeSwitzerland as a new Member of the United Nations and East Timor  which is soon to become a Member. Iam confident that the work of the Organization will beenriched by the addition of those two new Members.The increasing membership of the United Nations trulyreflects the fact that States are placing greater trust inthe relevancy and the work of the Organization.We live in challenging and dangerous times.Conflicts in various regions threaten global peace andsecurity. The danger posed by terrorism has become aglobal phenomenon. Millions of people the world overremain mired in the vicious circle of ignorance poverty and disease. The United Nations plays anindispensable role in our collective endeavour toovercome those daunting challenges.The Charter of the United Nations provides uswith the bedrock principles for maintaining peace andsecurity. Those principles — sovereignty  territorialintegrity and the non-threat or use of force —contribute to multilateralism and have deterred globalconflagration for nearly six decades. Those principlesmust remain inviolate if we are to meet the dauntingchallenges that confront us. Only through multilateralaction can we hope to overcome those challenges.Myanmar strongly believes in the United Nations andthe multilateralism it represents as the best guaranteeof global peace and security. We therefore share theview of the Secretary-General  who has said that “AllStates have a clear interest  as well as a clearresponsibility  to uphold international law and maintaininternational order” (A/57/PV.2).Terrorism poses a threat to all of mankind. Onlythrough our collective endeavour can we hope toovercome that menace. Pursuant to Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001)  we have taken necessaryactions to combat terrorism. Myanmar was also amongthe first countries to report to the Security Council'sCounter-Terrorism Committee on their actions againstterrorism. It promulgated an anti-money-laundering lawin June with firm provisions to help suppress terrorism.Myanmar has submitted to the Committee a secondreport  together with relevant documents  reflecting thelegislative and executive measures that we have taken togive effect to the resolution. Here I wish to reiteratethat Myanmar is against terrorism in all forms andmanifestations and that it will extend full cooperationto the international community to fight that menace.It is in our power to make the world a better place— a world of peace  a world of prosperity and a worldfree of conflict. To do that  we must do away withhatred. We face numerous challenges today. We mustwork together in a cooperative spirit to overcome thedangers and meet the challenges that confront us  bethey imposed by nature or induced by man.Throughout the ages the world has experiencedmany natural catastrophes and calamities  includingthose resulting in the extinction of dominant species.But the greatest danger we face today is not fromnature  but is caused by man.It is therefore not only pertinent  but also vital  torecall that the teachings of Lord Buddha  Jesus Christand the prophet Mohammed all emphasize love andcompassion as the guiding light to bring hope to all17mankind. If we want a better future for mankind  wemust take to our hearts the teachings of those greatreligions. We should let love and compassion guide us.Only by doing that can we overcome our evil instinctssuch as hatred  anger and the desire for revenge. Wemust all do away with animosity  jealousy  excessivepride and self-centred behaviour.Many tragedies today  including the tragic eventsof 11 September  have their roots in hatred  animosityand violence. It is those negative forces that we mustaddress and overcome. Violence cannot be overcomewith greater violence. That would only drive the worldtowards a vicious circle of increasing conflagrationsand calamities. Only a reign of love and compassioncan put out the raging fire of hatred and violence. It isnot in hatred  but rather in love and compassion  thatour future lies. Through the peaceful settlement ofdisputes we can find greater security for us all.The United Nations and the principles itenshrines is best placed to guide us to that path. TheUnited Nations is the light that can guide us to the pathof love  tolerance  compassion and caring. The UnitedNations was born out of our desire to live together inpeace with one another as good citizens of the Earth. Itshould not be used as a vehicle for inciting hatred.We live in an age of unprecedented prosperity but that prosperity is not shared by all. While somenations enjoy very high standards of living  themajority remains in poverty. The poor countries  eitherbecause of resource constraints or a lack of capital andtechnology  or because of conflicts  cannot hope toattain development without international cooperation.Because of their innate weakness and an unfavourableinternational economic environment  they will  ifunassisted  remain forever mired in poverty. Povertybreeds discontent and despair — ingredients that couldlead to a vicious circle of conflicts and violence.In Myanmar  which was subjected to untoldsufferings as a result of insurgencies for more than fourdecades  we are now actively promoting an end toconflict and bloodshed. We are also striving toeradicate poverty. We are building a modern anddeveloped nation where peace  prosperity  justice anddemocracy flourish. That is a process that has achievedsignificant progress. It is our fervent hope that ourendeavours towards that end will be helped  nothindered  and that our efforts to attain national unityand our efforts at nation-building will be met withunderstanding and encouragement.Because of historical legacies  we still findourselves having to address the issue of national unity.We are building a nation where all our 135 national racescan regard one another as brothers  a nation where there isequality and justice  a nation that will bring prosperity toall. Those are the ideals that motivate us; those are thegoals that we are determined to achieve.It is the goal of our Government to bring toreality the aspirations of the people of Myanmar to amultiparty democratic political system. To that end  weare laying firm foundations so that such a democraticsystem will have the strength to withstand anychallenges that arise. We are firmly convinced that onlythrough those strong foundations can we ensure a brighterfuture for our nation. That is a conviction born of ourbitter experiences — experiences of 14 years underparliamentary democracy and 26 years of socialism.In this nation-building process  we place specialimportance on poverty eradication  particularly in ruraland far-flung areas. In the border areas where themembers of most of our ethnic nationalities reside  weare implementing a programme of all-arounddevelopment. We have established 24 developmentzones towards that end. I should like to reiterate thatour relentless efforts in the nation-building process aremotivated by our desire to bring prosperity to all ournational brethren. We are laying the groundwork sothat successive Governments  which will emerge underthe new Constitution  will not have difficulty inovercoming future challenges. That is a task that weare endeavouring to accomplish with might and main.Understanding  cooperation and encouragement by theinternational community will hasten the process ofachieving our cherished goal. Ostracism and politicalpressure will surely not help  but will rather hinder  ourprogress on the path to our cherished goal ofdemocracy. However numerous the obstacles  whetherwe are helped or hindered  we remain resolute in ourdetermination  for the goal we seek is in fulfilment ofthe aspirations of our people: it is our noble destiny.Cooperation with the United Nations is thecornerstone of Myanmar's foreign policy. Let me take thisopportunity to apprise the Assembly of the continuedcooperation that Myanmar has extended to the UnitedNations. We received Mr. Razali Ismail  Special Envoyof the Secretary-General  for the eighth time in July182002. We provided all possible cooperation in theaccomplishment of his mission. Likewise  Mr. PauloSergio Pinheiro  Special Rapporteur of the Commissionon Human Rights  was accorded full and unhinderedcooperation during his visits to Myanmar.I would also like to share with the Assembly theheadway we have made in combating the scourge ofnarcotic drugs. The elimination of narcotic drugs wasdesignated as a national duty in 1988  and since thenefforts have been redoubled to meet that challenge. A15-year narcotics elimination plan has been formulatedand is in its fourth year of implementation. The plan isshowing results. The United Nations International DrugControl Programme and the International NarcoticsControl Board have acknowledged that poppycultivation in the country has fallen from more than90 000 acres in 1999-2000 to a little more than 62 000acres in 2001-2002.As part of our concerted effort  the New Destinyproject was launched earlier this year in the regionswhere poppy cultivation is concentrated. The mainobjective of the plan is to educate poppy farmers  todistribute substitute seeds  to provide financialassistance and to enhance law enforcement. As a result more than 290 tons of poppy seeds and dried poppybulbs have been voluntarily surrendered. Thesurrendered poppy seeds and bulbs were burned in thepresence of diplomats and of the international press.That alone has prevented a potential yield of 55 tons ofheroin with an estimated street value of more than $2.2billion. In addition  $1.1 billion worth of variousnarcotic drugs seized in the country was publiclydestroyed in June in Yangon. Moreover  26 000 acresof poppy fields were destroyed in 2000-2001 alone.Effective legal action has also been taken against drugtraffickers. As a country deeply committed toaddressing the problem of narcotic drugs  Myanmaralso looks forward to contributing to that cause in theinternational arena.We live in an increasingly integrated world. Inthis age of globalization  a new partnership betweendeveloped and developing countries is needed morethan ever before. The Millennium Declaration spelled outtargets for developmental cooperation. The MonterreyConsensus outlined actions to be implemented in keyfinancial sectors pertaining to development. The WorldSummit on Sustainable Development resulted in someprogress and in important commitments. Their earlyimplementation will lead to a more equal distributionof benefits in this rapidly globalizing world. It will alsoenable us to pass on to future generations a world thatis economically sustainable and environmentallysound. Myanmar stands ready to work with the rest ofthe family of nations to attain those goals — goals towhich we all pledged ourselves in the historicMillennium Declaration."
"116",4777,"MNG",57,2002,"﻿Mongoliawelcomes wholeheartedly the newest member of theUnited Nations family  Switzerland  a country that hasa long-standing association with the United Nations asits second largest headquarters. We also look forwardto welcoming East Timor  the youngest member of theinternational community.A little over two years ago  at the historicMillennium Summit held here in New York  our leadersreaffirmed their commitment to the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations Charter and pledgedtheir unequivocal support for a more efficient andreinvigorated United Nations so that this unique worldbody can effectively address the formidable challengesof the new century and  indeed  of the new millennium.Some important steps have been taken to reformand adapt the United Nations to the evolvinginternational realities  with a view to ensuring itsefficient functioning in the era of globalization.However  the reform process  particularly that of theSecurity Council  tends to slow down and hence  thereis an apparent need to take proper measures to speed itup. Mongolia stands for a just and equitableenlargement of the Security Council and fordemocratization of international relations by enhancingthe openness and transparency of the work of theSecurity Council and by increasing the role of theGeneral Assembly  as envisaged in the Charter of theUnited Nations.The United Nations has been instrumental inintensifying the efforts of the world community aimedat developing a collective response to global terror  athelping reach national reconciliation and build a peace23process in post-Taliban Afghanistan  at assisting in theemergence of an independent East Timor and at helpingto bring about the entry into force of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. It has also beenindispensable in paving the way towards reachingconsensus at Doha  Monterrey  Rome andJohannesburg  which were important steps along theroad towards meeting the millennium developmentgoals.Yet  much still remains to be done to sustain theprogress achieved  to honour commitments made andto redress setbacks to international peace and securityin today's volatile environment. The tragic events of 11September have shown that there is a need for afundamental change in our perception of security. Moreweapons and allocating more resources to the militarydo not necessarily translate into increased security.Security can no longer be confined to the boundaries ofa single State  or even a group of States. Thisindivisibility of global security makes multilateralismthe order of the day. To paraphrase the Secretary-General  let us all recognize that today global securityis our national security. Let us also recognize thatensuring the security of the human person must be atthe heart of our concerns. The concept of humansecurity is increasingly making a case for itself.The outgoing year has witnessed serious threatsto international peace and security. The remnants ofthose threats continue to pose a menace to theinternational community.In Afghanistan  the United Nations is helping theAfghan Government in its efforts towardsrehabilitation  reconstruction and development. Thoseobjectives can only be achieved if the Government ofPresident Karzai exercises effective control over theentire country.The prevailing explosive situation in the MiddleEast is of special concern. It calls for sustained effortsaimed at reaching a just and comprehensive solution tothe problem. Mongolia supports the efforts of theQuartet and of the countries of the region to find waysto peacefully settle that long-festering conflict. Theconvening of an international conference to considereffective measures for such a solution will undoubtedlybe a step in the right direction.My Government shares the view that the SecurityCouncil should make every effort to impress upon Iraqthe need to comply with Council resolutions and  as afirst step  accept weapons inspections unconditionally.The world community cannot afford to sit idle in theface of open defiance of mandatory resolutions of theSecurity Council.The world has not only been threatened by theescalation of tension in various regions  it has alsobeen threatened by increasing human insecurityresulting from the failure of the internationalcommunity to deliver on the crucial commitments itmade during the 1990s. In his address to the GeneralAssembly last year  my Prime Minister appealed to theinternational community to make the first decade ofthis new century a decade of implementation andcooperation towards a safer and better world  as wecannot afford to fail during yet another decade if weare serious about ensuring human security. We cannotafford to fail to implement the far-reaching  yetachievable  targets set by our leaders at the MillenniumSummit. That is all the more so as our failure orinaction could be used as justification for deadly actsby those who threaten peace  stability and socialprogress.That appeal is even more relevant today. The2002 Human Development Report indicates that ifcurrent trends continue  a significant portion of theworld's States are unlikely to achieve the millenniumdevelopment goals  including the overarching target ofhalving extreme poverty by 2015. If global progresscontinues at such a snail's pace  it will take more than130 years to rid the world of hunger.A legitimate question arises  namely what has tobe done by the international community to redress thatsituation? The short answer could be to display genuinesolidarity and for all to share responsibility inhonouring the commitments made without delay. Butthe people of our countries  in whose service this worldbody was conceived  have waited through dozens ofconferences and their five-year reviews while theimplementation of agreed targets continues to bestalled at levels far from those desired. Under thesecircumstances it is our considered view that it isincumbent upon the international community to closelylook into the existing imbalance in global governance especially in the economic and social areas.Mongolia believes that with its impartiality anduniversal legitimacy  as well as its Charter-basedprevalence over any other international agreement  theUnited Nations is uniquely placed to provide for global24governance in economic and social areas whileallowing equal participation by the South in thedecision-making process. We therefore believe that it ishigh time to engage in an earnest dialogue about anentirely new framework of development cooperationthat is more responsive to the emerging imperatives ofglobal human security.As we see it  the new development partnershipbetween the North and the South should be based onjustice  not on charity; on equitable sharing of globalmarket opportunities  not on protectionism or aid; andon mutual cooperation  not on unilateral conditionalityor confrontation. The Economic and Social Council hasan important role to play in initiating and promotingthat dialogue  in line with the objectives set forth inArticle 55 of the Charter.Furthermore  transnational organized crime  illicitdrugs  money-laundering  the illegal arms trade  thespread of HIV/AIDS  global pollution  climate changeand other negative phenomena pose a persistent threatto rich and poor nations alike. They call for a newcooperation framework to be developed to defend thenew frontiers of global human security and to fillcritical gaps in the existing system of global economicgovernance. At a time of increasing globalization  theformidable challenges facing the human family requirean adequate response. It would be a fallacy to replacefundamental reform with a piecemeal approach ormarginal remedies. If there is strong political will onthe part of the international community to collectivelystand up to these challenges  then why not engage in acommon quest for an adequate architecture of globalgovernance for human security?Mongolia expresses its firm support for thecreation of the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD). NEPAD is a comprehensiveblueprint and a broad vision for Africa's futureeconomic and social development. It is Africa-owned and based on the lessons of the past decade. We hopethat that important initiative will receive the generoussupport of the international community with a view toattaining the ambitious goal of an African renaissance.My own country  Mongolia  which has theinherent development handicap of being landlockedand is very susceptible to natural disasters  is notimmune from many of the threats to human security towhich I have referred. In addition to the persistence ofpoverty and unemployment and the disruption of basichealth and social services  human security in Mongoliais affected by the increasing recurrence of naturaldisasters and the spread of environmental degradation including desertification  water and air pollution.Efforts to improve human security are furtherhampered by extremely low population density  a weakinfrastructure and a small  non-diversified economythat is very vulnerable to external shocks.Capitalizing on its valuable assets of well-educated human resources and accumulated experienceof reform in both the political and economic areas Mongolia is endeavouring to ensure the human securityof its people through both national action andinternational cooperation.Nationally  my Government launched  in late2000  the Good Governance for Human Securityprogramme  aimed at improving the capacity toformulate and implement policies to ensure humansecurity. Thus far  we have succeeded in securing anational commitment to its implementation on the partof all the branches of the State; institutionalizing theprogramme's implementation mechanism; and layingthe groundwork for the greater involvement andparticipation of civil society  the private sector andacademia.At the international level  Mongolia  for its part has been endeavouring to contribute  where it can  tothe common efforts of the world community  whiledrawing attention to issues of particular concern to it.As a landlocked developing country  Mongoliaattaches particular importance to enhancinginternational cooperation to ease the inherentdevelopment challenges faced by that group ofcountries. In this regard  my delegation looks forwardto the forthcoming International Ministerial Meeting ontransit transport cooperation  to be held in 2003 inKazakhstan.In recognition of the crucial role of education inensuring sustainable human development and humansecurity  my delegation is pleased to note that at its lastsession the General Assembly proclaimed — as theresult of an initiative of Mongolia — the 10-yearperiod starting 1 January 2003 as the United NationsLiteracy Decade. We look forward to the unanimousadoption of the Decade's draft plan of action at thissession of the General Assembly.25Ten years ago Mongolia declared itself a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Since then  it has adopted nationallegislation defining and regulating that status. Atpresent  consultations are under way with ourimmediate neighbours and other States concerned onways to institutionalize our status internationally. Iwould like to take this opportunity to thank the fivenuclear-weapon States for their cooperation  andUnited Nations bodies for their invaluable support intranslating the initiative into reality.In recent years  Mongolia has been activelyengaged in establishing and strengthening institutionsand processes of democratic governance  protectinghuman rights and promoting democratic consolidation.Its efforts have been similar to those of many otherStates that are promoting democratic values anddeveloping democratic institutions. We believe that theFifth International Conference of New or RestoredDemocracies  to be held from 18 to 20 June 2003 inMongolia  could provide an important opportunity forthe international community to exchange informationand experience and search for practical ways ofpromoting and strengthening democracy nationally andinternationally. I would like to take this opportunity toexpress my Government's heartfelt gratitude to thisbody for graciously accepting our offer and setting inmotion the preparations for the Conference. The maintheme of the Conference is democracy  goodgovernance and civil society.Mongolia believes that the International CriminalCourt  established on 1 July  could be instrumental inending impunity and upholding justice  deterring futurecrimes and further strengthening international criminallaw. As one of its founding members  Mongolia alsobelieves that the widest possible accession to the Courtwill broaden the geographic scope of the Court'sjurisdiction and thus end impunity for acts of genocide war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Court'sjurisdiction should eventually cover the crime ofaggression.In conclusion  may I reiterate my Government'sresolve to work with other Member States towardsmaking our world Organization better equipped to meetthe global challenges lying ahead."
"117",4818,"MOZ",57,2002,"﻿I wish to joinprevious speakers in congratulating Mr. Jan Kavan onhis election as President of the fifty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly. We are confident that  with hisexperience  wisdom and proven skills  ourdeliberations will produce the desired successfuloutcome.Let me also pay a well-deserved tribute to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for ForeignAffairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea  for theexcellent manner in which he discharged his duties as21President of the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly.I would also wish to commend the Secretary-General for his continued devotion to peace anddevelopment worldwide. During his recent visit toMozambique  we had the opportunity to discuss thebest ways of furthering the goals of the United Nationsand strengthening cooperation between Mozambiqueand the United Nations. We remain committed tocontinuing to work closely with the Secretary-General.The Government of Mozambique welcomes theSwiss Confederation as a Member of the UnitedNations and looks forward to welcoming theDemocratic Republic of East Timor. They will furtherstrengthen our universal Organization.Allow me to express our sympathy to the peoplesand the Governments of several countries in the worldthat have recently been hit by severe floods. We inMozambique and in Southern Africa understand theeconomic and social consequences of floods. Floods drought and other natural calamities have become afrequent occurrence in the world  and in Africa inparticular. It is therefore our hope and expectation thatwe will be able to prepare ourselves to better deal withissues arising from natural disasters. Perhaps it is hightime we revisit the outcome of the 1994 WorldConference on Natural Disaster Reduction  held inYokohama.The 11 September 2001 attacks demonstrated toall of us the dangers of international terrorism  whichrepresents a serious threat to the peace and security ofevery nation  rich or poor. In that regard  it is ourcollective duty to fight this threat effectively  under theleadership of the United Nations. To be successful inthis endeavour we need to clearly understand andaddress the root causes of terrorism  amongst which wewant to stress poverty and other injustices.In addition to Security Council resolution 1373(2001)  we must give due recognition to regionalagreements and declarations to combat and eliminateterrorism  such as the 1999 Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU) Convention on the Prevention andCombating of Terrorism  and the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) Declaration againstTerrorism adopted by our heads of State orGovernment in January this year  as valuable tools forstrengthening cooperation and providing a platform foreffective action to suppress terrorism.Mozambique has already submitted its report onlegislation and measures for preventing and combatingterrorism  and is in the final stages of the process ofratifying all 12 conventions on terrorism. However  forthe effective implementation of these legal instrumentsMozambique needs support from the internationalcommunity to strengthen its institutions  namely thepolice  the judiciary  the financial system and theAttorney-General's office.We have witnessed this year the holding of anumber of major United Nations conferences andsummits devoted to a wide range of socio-economicissues: the International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  the World Food Summit  the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development and the specialsession of the General Assembly on Children. We havealso seen the holding in Barcelona of an internationalconference on HIV/AIDS  at which our leadersrecognized that this pandemic is a global problemchallenging our common will and requiring globalresponsibility and response.The common feature of all these events has beenstrong and unanimous agreement on the need to ensurethe implementation of the agreed outcomes andcommitments in order to meet the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Our leaders have stressed that forthis to happen  there is a need for unity of purpose collective responsibility and political will.We should  continuously and critically  assess theprogress made in each area of commitment  with aview to realizing the aspirations and needs of ourpeoples. The future of the world is in our hands. Wemust not fail to meet the expectations of our peoples.The time has now come for action. We must actdecisively to honour the commitments made in theMillennium Declaration.My Government has been following with keeninterest the latest developments in the Middle East. Weurge both parties to return to the negotiating table tofind a lasting peace in that region; such a peace mustinclude an independent Palestinian State living side byside with Israel  and the solution of outstanding issuesdeemed important by both parties. Without acomprehensive and just solution to the question ofPalestine  and without full respect for the legitimateinterests of all the peoples of the region  the prospectsof peace will remain elusive and distant. Theinternational community should encourage both Israelis22and Palestinians to work hard for peace  drawing on allthe strength and resolve they need to overcomeobstacles along the way. Taking into account our ownexperience in Mozambique  we believe that peace is areal possibility in the Middle East  and that the partiesmust seize the opportunity now.I would like to take this opportunity tocongratulate the Government of Iraq on its wisedecision to allow the return of the United Nationsinspectors. It is our hope that the resumption of theinspections will mark a new era of cooperation betweenIraq and the United Nations within the spirit and theletter of the United Nations Charter and internationallaw.This session is taking place at a moment when weare witnessing important progress regarding theresolution of conflicts in Africa. In Angola we havenoted with satisfaction the conclusion of aMemorandum of Understanding between theGovernment and UNITA  which marked the end of aprotracted war. We salute this Memorandum ofUnderstanding and believe that it opens a new era forthe Angolan people: an era of hope and greatexpectations. We appeal to the international communityto continue supporting the people and the Governmentof Angola in the consolidation of peace and stability national reconstruction and the strengthening ofdemocracy  as well as in responding to the currenthumanitarian needs.Sierra Leone is living in peace after thesuccessful implementation of the peace process  andfollowing general and presidential elections. We hopethat these positive developments will lead to theimprovement of the political environment in the Manoriver region as a whole.The recent agreements between the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and Rwanda  as well as theunderstanding between the Democratic Republic of theCongo and Uganda  have created the hope that thepeace process will be irreversible. The attainment ofpeace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo willundoubtedly contribute to bringing about the neededstability in the Great Lakes region  and will pave theway for the rapid economic integration of SouthernAfrica. We believe that with good will there can be asolution to the concerns of all parties involved in thisconflict.In the Comoros and in Lesotho  peace is now areality. We salute the efforts made by the peoples ofthose countries to make Africa a continent of hope. Weare happy to see Ethiopia and Eritrea working together with the support of the United Nations  to strengthenpeace and good-neighbourliness. The acceptance byboth parties of the decision of the BoundaryCommission was a major step forward.My Government is concerned at the lack ofprogress in Western Sahara. We wish to encourage theUnited Nations and the parties concerned to pursuefurther efforts  within the established framework  witha view to finding a lasting and internationallyacceptable solution to this issue.The African leaders established the NewPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) as aninstrument to address these problems. NEPAD is basedon the principle of African ownership aiming at settingan agenda to renew the continent and to encompassnational and regional priorities along with developmentplans. This is to be done through a participatoryprocess and a new framework for interaction andpartnership with the rest of the world.The support already expressed by many partnersof Africa is a signal that NEPAD is a viable initiative.In that context  I would like to salute the encouragingresults of the Group of Eight Summit recently held inKananaskis  Canada  where the world's mostindustrialized countries expressed their support forNEPAD. In the same vein  I salute the results of theGeneral Assembly's high-level meeting on NEPAD held in this Hall two days ago. These results enhanceour hope of a better future for Africa. Let us worktogether to make it a reality.In Mozambique  as part of efforts to fight povertyand to implement the Millennium Declaration  theGovernment approved  and is implementing  a Plan ofAction for the Eradication of Absolute Poverty  locallyknown as PARPA. The overall objective of PARPA isthe substantial reduction of absolute poverty in thecountry through investment in education  health agriculture and rural development  as well as throughgood governance and macroeconomic stability.PARPA is partially financed by savings achievedthrough debt reduction from our creditors — bilateraland multilateral — under the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries (HIPC) Initiative. We are thankful to all ourpartners for the debt reduction and the cancellations we23are receiving. Let us continue to work together to finda definitive solution.This session is being held at a particularlyimportant moment in the history of Mozambique  giventhat on 4 October 2002 we will celebrate the 10thanniversary of the signing of the Rome PeaceAgreement  which marked the end of a devastating warof destabilization. Ten years after this historicachievement  the Mozambicans have kept the peaceand shown that they can live together in harmony.Given the historic significance of this date  we havedeclared it a national holiday: the Day of Peace andReconciliation.Mozambicans are today enjoying the dividends ofpeace  which were achieved with the invaluablecontribution of the United Nations in what became apeacekeeping operation success story.To consolidate this hard-won peace  we areimplementing home-grown development plans with aview to promoting the welfare of our people. We arealso strengthening democracy  governance and the ruleof law  and preparations are under way for theforthcoming municipal elections in 2003 and thegeneral and presidential elections in 2004.In my address during the fifty-sixth session of theGeneral Assembly  I spoke of the negativeconsequences of the floods which affectedMozambique during two consecutive years  2000 and2001. Today  I am pleased to inform the Assembly thatmost of the flood's victims have been resettled and areengaged in productive activities. Mozambique'seconomy is gradually recovering from the scourge ofthe floods  and  as a result of the hard work of theMozambican people and of adequate internationalassistance  my country achieved a growth rate of 13.9per cent in its gross domestic product last year and of12.1 per cent in the first six months of this year.The report of the Secretary-General on assistanceto Mozambique (A/57/97)  which I commend  providesa further account of the achievements recorded by theMozambican people in the process of nationalreconstruction and of economic and socialrehabilitation following the floods of 2000 and 2001.The 2001 Human Development Report gives additionalevidence of the progress that has been achieved.I should like to take this opportunity to reiteratethe sincere gratitude of the people and the Governmentof Mozambique to the international community for itsinvaluable support to the victims of the flooding.Mozambique will continue to count on the internationalcommunity's support  in particular with a view tomitigating the effects of the drought that is affectingMozambique and other countries of southern andeastern Africa  and in order better to prepare thecountry to face natural calamities.In conclusion  I should like to reaffirm mycountry's faith in the United Nations and in its Charter for they remain the indispensable foundation of a just peaceful and more prosperous world. We believe thatthe current reform of the United Nations will help it toprovide better service to Member States  particularlythose most in need. We are convinced that the reformwill give rise to a stronger United Nations  with a clearfocus on developing countries and on results-orientedactions."
"118",4864,"MRT",57,2002,"﻿Mr.President  on behalf of the delegation of the IslamicRepublic of Mauritania  I would like to congratulateyou on your election to the Presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We areconfident that your experience and wisdom  alreadywell-proven  will ensure the success of this session. Iwould also like to thank your predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his able guidanceof the work of the last session. Also  I would like tocongratulate the Swiss Confederation and theDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste on theiradmission to membership in the United Nations.I would also like to congratulate most warmly ourUnited Nations Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  and theUnited Nations staff for their excellent work inpromoting the noble goals of this Organization.We note with satisfaction the significant activitiesand the commendable international conferences heldthis past year  primarily the United Nations Conferenceon HIV/AIDS in New York  the Monterrey Conferenceon Financing for Development and the World Summiton Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.Such international conferences have placed theworld before its collective responsibilities in dealingwith core issues that require global solutions. What isat stake is the equilibrium and future of the world. Thissession is being held one year after the criminal attacksagainst New York and Washington. I would like toconfirm once again that Mauritania totally condemnsthose terrorist acts. We condemn terrorism in all itsforms. Mauritania will be actively involved in regionaland international initiatives to combat that perniciousphenomenon. We reconfirm our full support for therelevant Security Council resolutions and are resolvedto implement them  specifically resolution 1373 (2001)of 28 September 2001.The tragic events highlighted a new reality.Terrorism  instead of being a marginal phenomenon has become a core issue ignoring borders and whichcan only be combated through a global strategy.Nobody should believe that fighting terrorism is a clashbetween two civilizations or cultures. Rather  we mustact together to show that the elimination of terrorism isa new step taken by the human race towards furtherdeveloping its comprehensive  all-inclusive civilizationand attaining its aspirations for a safe and better future.In order to achieve peace and security  the UnitedNations must play an ever-larger part to strengtheninternational law. We noted the sustained efforts andthe repeated calls for peace in the Middle East. Webelieve the Arab countries' initiative adopted at theBeirut Summit offers the ideal framework forcomprehensive and lasting peace that will ensureprogress and prosperity for all peoples in the region.We noted with great interest the vision of the Presidentof the United States of America  Mr. George Bush  whospoke of the need for the coexistence of twoindependent States  Palestine and Israel  and efforts bythe Quartet and the European Union with a view to theestablishment of an independent Palestinian State withAl-Quds al-Sharif as its capital. This play is pursuantto the terms of reference of Madrid and the land-for-peace principle and is also in accordance with SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425(1978. We reiterate the need for an immediate Israeliwithdrawal from all territories of the PalestinianAuthority  an end to the suffering of the Palestinianpeople and the immediate resumption of peacenegotiations. This is the only way to have peace andsecurity in the Middle East.We hope to see a return to peace  stability andharmony in the Gulf region. We oppose the use of forceagainst Iraq and affirm our support for a peaceful25solution to settle the crisis in accordance withinternational law.We are concerned that there should be respect forthe independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait and respect for the independence and territorialintegrity of Iraq. Once again we call for the lifting ofthe embargo against the Iraqi people  which has nowbeen in place for more than 12 years.With regard to Western Sahara  we support theefforts by the Secretary-General and his PersonalEnvoy  James Baker  to find a definitive solution toinsure stability in the region  one that would beaccepted by all of the parties.On developments pursuant to the Lockerbiecrisis  we welcome the significant steps taken by theLibyan Arab Jamahiriya to find a diplomatic solutionto the problem. We think it is now up to the SecurityCouncil to take the necessary steps to lift the embargoimposed on Libya.Turning to our own continent  Africa  wewelcome the birth of the African Union  which will bea framework for enabling the African peoples toachieve their aspirations for progress and development.We also support the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  which seeks to strengthenregional cooperation to achieve economic integration and we welcome the support given to this initiative byour development partners.Mauritania reiterates its support for the People'sRepublic of China  the sole legitimate representative ofthe Chinese people  pursuant to General Assemblyresolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971. Mauritania welcomesthe efforts made by the Government of the People'sRepublic of China for the peaceful reunification of thatcountry.We have now seen it proven that violence andextremism result from poverty and despair. Theinternational community must therefore make moreefforts in the areas of human solidarity and socialprogress everywhere in the world. We call for thenecessary assistance to be provided to the countries ofthe South and for the opening of the markets of thedeveloped countries to the products of developingcountries.  Investment opportunities in developingcountries should be increased.Despite the huge challenges and a difficulteconomic international situation  the Islamic Republicof Mauritania has taken major steps towardsdevelopment and construction  as noted by ourPresident at the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment in Johannesburg. We have establishedsolid foundations for sustainable development and havedeveloped a clear-cut strategy to combat poverty.We have taken steps towards comprehensiveeducation  health care and other social services for ourpeople such as drinking water  electricity andcommunications. Illiteracy and ignorance are majorobstacles to development. We have launched broadliteracy and education campaigns for our citizens. Wehave been able to do this because of our pluralistdemocratic system  which insures freedoms and humanrights in an atmosphere of security and stability.The United Nations Charter seeks common goalsof freedom and solidarity for all people. Newdevelopments in the international arena in the last fewyears require our Organization  including the SecurityCouncil  to adapt to changes. Today  more than everbefore  we must comply with the commitments wemade to achieve a new world order based on justiceand rights law  to ensure peace  security and dignity forall."
"119",4910,"MUS",57,2002,"﻿It gives meimmense pleasure to address the fifty-seventh sessionof the United Nations General Assembly under yourable leadership. Allow me  on behalf of my delegation to extend to you our wholehearted congratulations onyour election as the President of the present session. Iwish to assure you of my delegation's support andcooperation throughout your tenure of office.I also wish to convey my thanks to HisExcellency Dr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic ofKorea for the remarkable manner in which heconducted the work of the Assembly's fifty-sixthsession. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annanalso deserves our gratitude for his inspiring andcommendable initiatives in furthering the objectives ofour Organization.We are happy that the Swiss Confederation andTimor-Leste have joined us as the newest members ofthe United Nations family. Timor-Leste stands out as ashining accomplishment of the United Nations systemto uphold the right to independence of a nation inadverse conditions.The terrorist atrocities of 11 September will neverfade from our collective consciousness  and the agonyand the pain of the day are still with us. Thesophisticated infrastructure of the terroristorganizations that was utilized to inflict thatmonstrosity must be dismantled at any cost. We owe itto ourselves and to the generations that will come afterus to mobilize all our energies and efforts to never letthat happen again  anywhere.Mauritius is committed to remain fully engagedin the global coalition against terrorism  and we shallcontinue  together with other States  to take allmeasures  nationally  regionally and internationally so that the scourge of terrorism is never inflicted onunsuspecting civilians and countries. We are alive tothe chilling reality that no country is or ever will besafe until the war against terrorism is finally andcompletely won. We condemn cross-border infiltration;it must stop and must be made to stop.The threats posed by international terrorism haveheightened the need for collective action to preserveworld peace and security. While we combine ourefforts to wage a war on terrorism  we should  at thesame time  continue to work towards globaldisarmament and a complete elimination of weapons ofmass destruction within a specified time frame. Mydelegation reiterates its appeal for the early conveningof a conference on nuclear disarmament.The term of Mauritius as an elected non-permanent member of the Security Council will end in20December this year. During its tenure on the Council Mauritius was instrumental in the establishment of anad hoc working group on conflict prevention andresolution in Africa. It has made positive andconstructive recommendations that have been endorsedby the Security Council.In contrast to previous years  when the GeneralAssembly listened to a litany of horror stories out ofAfrica  I am happy to note that substantial and positivedevelopments are taking place on the continent. Thereis a new dawn in Africa and the stark realization that without enduring peace and stability  there will be nosustainable development.We congratulate the African leaders who havespared no effort in the search for African solutions toAfrican conflicts and crises. The Pretoria Agreementbetween Presidents Kabila and Kagame represents amajor breakthrough for the peace process in the GreatLakes region. We are aware that the implementationwill be difficult. We are  however  confident that theinternational community will provide all necessaryassistance to the leaders in the region for a smoothimplementation.With the positive developments in Angola  thesuccessful general elections in Sierra Leone  thesettlement of the boundary problem between Eritreaand Ethiopia and the progress made in theimplementation of the Arusha Peace and ReconciliationAgreement for Burundi  there are clear signals thatsome of the major conflicts in Africa are beingsuccessfully resolved.As Africa embarks on the road of peace  we wishto underscore the crucial role played by theIntergovernmental Authority on Development  theEconomic Community of West African States and theSouthern African Development Community in theirrelentless search for negotiated settlement of theconflicts in our respective subregions. There is causefor optimism  and it is gratifying that the days of doomand gloom for Africa are on their way to extinction.Our region  the Indian Ocean  which haswitnessed some turbulent times recently  is againpoised for stability and development. We applaud thereturn to constitutional rule in the Comoros and theconsolidation of democratic institutions in that country.We also welcome the formation of a Government ofnational reconciliation in Madagascar and the effortsunder way to undo the damage caused by the recentcrisis there. Mauritius will be closely associated withthe countries of our region to further enhance regionalcooperation.The launching of the African Union in Durban South Africa  in July this year was indeed a historicand emotionally charged occasion. The birth of theAfrican Union heralds a new era of political  economicand social transformation for our continent. Thecontinent is more than ever determined to shape itsdestiny and to tackle comprehensively the burningproblems of poverty  hunger  disease andunderdevelopment that have debilitated millions ofAfricans over the years. The African Union has raisedexpectations that we  as leaders  are committed tohonour. The African Union will be able to respond in apositive manner to the challenges confronting it  aswell as maximizing the opportunities for theimprovement of the lives of peoples of the continent. Inthat context  the decision of African countries to takeresponsibility for peacekeeping on the continent needsto be encouraged. Since the burden of peacekeepingmust be equitably shared  I am pleased to announcethat Mauritius will contribute to the United Nationscivilian police for service in post-conflict operations.Along with the launching of the African Union the home-grown New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD) is another chapter in theunfolding of the success story of the African continent.NEPAD commits Africa to building a strong andenduring culture of democracy  respect for humanrights and accountability for the continent. Indeed  theAfrican Peer Review Mechanism is a crediblemechanism to promote the prospects of internationallyrecognized norms and standards of good governance.The establishment of the International CriminalCourt (ICC) marks a watershed in mankind's quest toput an end to impunity and to bring to justice thoseresponsible for crimes against humanity  for genocideand for international crimes. The ICC is the single mostimportant institution of this millennium  and it is theduty of the international community to fully support it.In May this year  during the special session onchildren  Mauritius had the opportunity to join theinternational efforts to pave the way for effectiveprotection for every child in every part of the world.The children who addressed the gathering utteredwords of great significance that no one can  or should ever forget. The future is theirs  and it is for them that21we ought to ensure the sustainable development of ourone and only planet. My country will ensure that theprinciples  goals and actions discussed during thespecial session are integrated in our various childwelfare programmes.The Middle East is still not at peace. The deathtoll rises every day  but we are encouraged by thesignals being sent by both the Israelis and thePalestinian leadership. Our vision of the Middle East isto see the early establishment of a Palestinian Stateliving side by side with Israel on the basis of agreedand secure boundaries. The Palestinians also need tohave State machinery that observes the fundamentalnorms of a democratic system  with responsibility andaccountability on the part of the leaders. They alonehave the absolute right to elect their leaders whenelections are held in January 2003.We appeal to the Iraqi authorities to comply fullyand unconditionally with Security Council resolutionswith respect to allowing the arms inspectors to fulfiltheir mandate.Small island developing States are a particularlyvulnerable group of countries by virtue of theirinherent natural and structural constraints. The WorldBank; the Commonwealth; the United NationsConference on Financing for Development  held inMonterrey  Mexico; and the World Summit onSustainable Development  held recently inJohannesburg  South Africa  have all recognized thatthose constraints  if not addressed effectively  couldundermine the trade and development prospects ofthese countries  leading to their furthermarginalization. We look forward to specific andconcrete recommendations for action in this regard atthe Fifth Ministerial Conference of the World TradeOrganization scheduled to be held next September inMexico.The World Summit on Sustainable Developmentaddressed the fundamental question of what kind ofworld we want for ourselves and for generations thatare yet unborn. The recent devastating floods in Europeand Asia  as well as the droughts in many parts ofAfrica  particularly Southern Africa  where there aremore than 13 million people in danger of famine  area stark reminder of the fragility of our planet'secosystem. The World Summit on SustainableDevelopment has made the whole world conscious ofthe havoc that nature may cause unless drasticmeasures are taken immediately to redress theecological imbalance.(spoke in French)The Ninth Summit of La Francophonie  whichLebanon will host next month and which will be heldon the topic dialogue of cultures'  will undoubtedlyenable the French-speaking community to fostersharing among various cultures with a view tomaintaining peace  security and democracy.(spoke in English)Mauritius reaffirms its legitimate sovereigntyover the Chagos Archipelago  including the island ofDiego Garcia  which was detached from the territory ofMauritius by the United Kingdom prior to ourindependence. We renew our call to the former colonialPower  the United Kingdom  to accelerate discussionswith us for an early settlement of this issue. Thepersons of Mauritian origin who were displaced fromthe Chagos Archipelago continue to claim redress forthe serious human rights violations that they endured.We support their efforts to seek redress.We also call on the French Government to worktowards the resolution of the dispute concerningTromelin Island  over which Mauritius has sovereignty.In conclusion  Mauritius reiterates its convictionthat the United Nations system remains the bestguarantee for international peace and security.The framework within which the United Nationsorganizes the collective security of States may not beperfect  but it is at least one that is tested and hasserved us relatively well for more than 50 years.Working on the basis of the neutrality of rules andprinciples is far preferable to the haphazardness ofexpediency. We also should not be unmindful of thelinkages which exist between different situations  andthat is why we urge the international community toobserve the principle of equality of treatment in allcases."
"120",4947,"MWI",57,2002,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment of the Republic of Malawi and on my ownbehalf  I would like to congratulate President Kavanmost warmly on his unanimous election as President ofthe fifty-seventh regular session of the GeneralAssembly. I am confident that under his able28leadership  buttressed by a pragmatic approach to theproceedings of the session  we will be able to furtherconsolidate past gains on a variety of issues  and alsomobilize renewed international resolve and politicalwill to reinvigorate our continued search for viableresponses and solutions to the many pressingchallenges that threaten the very survival ofhumankind.I take this opportunity also to pay special tributeto his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republicof Korea  for the able manner in which he handled thework of the General Assembly during his tenure ofoffice.Further  I would like to register my country's voteof thanks for and special recognition of the invaluablecontribution made by the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  in injecting fresh impetus and a sharper senseof purpose and direction into the work of the UnitedNations. His informative and insightful annual reportson the work of the United Nations clearly point to anorganization that is moving in the direction that itshould and is much more focused on the quest foraccelerated growth and socio-economic progress of thedisadvantaged poor nations.A number of developments have taken placearound the world since the last general debate. Whilesome of these are relatively positive and are  thus far  acause for optimism  yet others  a majority  are  at best disheartening and tend to cast a long shadow onprospects for long term progress  especially in our partof the world.As I speak now  for example  six southern Africacountries  including Malawi  are in the throes of asevere and life-threatening food crisis brought on bydrought-related deficits in grain harvests. Up to 13million people in Lesotho  Malawi  Mozambique Swaziland  Zambia and Zimbabwe are facing severefood shortage  which has already given rise to a threatof widespread famine and a rise in famine-relatedhealth problems. What we are clearly seeing here is afurther deterioration in the general poverty situationand the humanitarian plight of the rural masses in thesecountries. Chances of the food insecurity translatinginto a serious region-wide security and healthcatastrophe cannot be over-emphasized  especiallygiven that southern Africa is already the epicentre ofthe global implosion caused by HIV/AIDS. The currentfood crisis in the sub-region stands out as the severestin many years. It is poised to inflict incalculabledamage on the social  economic and cultural fabric ofwhole communities  and it endangers the efficacy ofthe financial and economic sustainability of theinstitutional and public policy frameworks forsustainable development currently underimplementation.Indeed  southern Africa is facing uniquelydifferent multifaceted humanitarian crises arising notonly from civil wars  but also from social andeconomic factors and other natural disasters. The crisisis certain to roll back numerous past gains in manysectors  particularly because of the centrality ofagricultural production to the gross domestic productand rural employment of most of the affected countries.The food shortage has placed further seriousstrains on the already low revenue collection capacitiesof the affected countries  especially to the extent thatbudgetary allocations are having to be appropriatedfrom critical social sector services to fund massivegrain imports necessary to supplement inadequate localgrain stocks  thereby financially starving other equallyurgent sectoral needs. Sadly  however  the next harvest due in eight months  may not hold much promiseeither  unless the drought cycle  which is the majorcontributing factor  does not recur.Initially  Malawi faced a grain deficit of 600 000tons caused by two years of a paradoxical combinationof drought and devastating torrential rains and floods.This tonnage was urgently required to stave off arapidly deteriorating famine situation that is expectedto affect 3.2 million people. The President  HisExcellency Dr. Bakili Muluzi  declared the current foodshortages a national disaster on 28 February 2002  anda vigorous national appeal for emergency relief hasbeen under way since then.The response to this appeal by the donorcommunity  both local and international  has been veryencouraging. On behalf of the Government of Malawi I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitudeand deep appreciation to the local and internationalhumanitarian organizations and Governments  such asthose of the European Union  the Governments of Italy the United Kingdom and the United States of America and other friendly Governments  which together havefinanced nearly 75 per cent of the emergency reliefsupplies received so far in Malawi. We also wish tothank the United Nations funds and programmes for29their timely assistance  in particular the Food andAgricultural Organization of the United Nations  theWorld Food Programme and the Office for theCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)  as wellas resident United Nations agencies  for providingrelief coordination and procurement services duringthis critical hour of need.In a special way  and on behalf of the sixSouthern African Development Community (SADC)countries affected by the famine  the Government ofMalawi wishes to thank the Secretary-General and theUnited Nations family for successfully organizing theConsolidated National Appeals for the HumanitarianCrisis in Southern Africa  which took place on 18 July2002  here at United Nations Headquarters. We aregrateful for the outcome of the appeal  and we wouldlike to extend similar sentiments of appreciation to allGovernments and donor organizations that madepledges and commitments towards the fundingrequirements of the appeal.In addition  we welcome and applaud theSecretary-General's timely appointment of theExecutive Director of the World Food Programme Mr. James Morris  as his Special Envoy for thesouthern African humanitarian crisis. Mr. Morris'spersonal meetings and consultations with the Heads ofState and Government of the six southern Africancountries and his tour of the subregion have led touseful high-level exchanges that will form an importantbasis for tackling the problem of food insecurity infuture. We undertake to work with him and give him allthe support and cooperation necessary for thefulfilment of his mandate.The high levels of poverty and the deepeningscourge of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and othertransmissible diseases afflicting our people continue toravage populations in the developing countries particularly those of Africa. We take no relief from theannual reports for the year 2002 released by UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development and theWorld Health Organization  whose graphic statisticaldata and hard facts portray an unabating  vicious andcomplex interplay between structural poverty and astartlingly high HIV/AIDS prevalence in poorcountries. The resulting humanitarian crisis threatensmillions more lives over the next few years.As home to one of the largest numbers of victimsof the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the world  southernAfrica needs closer attention and concrete actions  aswell as deeper resource commitments by theinternational community  to help build sustainablecapacity to address the critical poverty issues andexcessive mortality from HIV/AIDS  malaria tuberculosis and other diseases. These are extremelysensitive issues  and the international donor communityshould consider  on an emergency basis  the difficultmoral issues and the choices involved.It is extremely troubling that some Member Statesand donor institutions have suddenly taken aminimalist approach to the central role played byUnited Nations funds and programmes in tacklinghealth problems in the developing countries. It isneedless to remind this Assembly that the work of theUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in tacklingthe HIV/AIDS pandemic  in the implementation of theProgramme of Action adopted at the InternationalConference on Population and Development (ICPD)and in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS is very crucial. We call upon donors andmultinational institutions to reconsider their decisionand to restore funding to UNFPA.Further  we call upon multilateral donorinstitutions and industrialized countries to grant deeperdebt relief and forgiveness. Transnationalorganizations  which extract huge profits from theirbusiness operations in poor countries  have the moralresponsibility to invest in HIV/AIDS prevention  care support and treatment. International pharmaceuticalcorporations  too  ought to show more compassion byexpanding access to antiretroviral drugs and other life-sustaining medicines  including meaningfulconcessions on price reduction and voluntarydonations. We note with gratitude the positive stepstaken by some pharmaceutical companies in thatdirection.My Government acknowledges the important roleplayed by the United Nations in mobilizing support andresources for the development process in the poorcountries. It is not enough  however  to hold oneconference after another without effective follow-upand implementation mechanisms. There is therefore aneed for supportive global processes that would ensureshorter time lags between the adoption of programmesof action and their implementation.It is our hope that the establishment of the Officeof the High Representative for the Least Developed30Countries in the United Nations Secretariat willpromote regular consultations and closer follow-up ofagreed programmes of action to ensure their fulfilment.Such programmes of action include the BrusselsDeclaration and Programme of Action of the ThirdUnited Nations Conference on the Least DevelopedCountries  the International Conference on Financingfor Development and other commitments flowing fromthe recent General Assembly special sessions on HIV/AIDS and children. An earnest attempt is necessary tolink up the commitments and agreed outcomes of theBrussels Programme of Action and the MonterreyConsensus in order to create a rich resource base forthe implementation of the Johannesburg Plan of Actionfor sustainable development.Other major problems and challenges that arefaced by poor countries and stifle their progress havepreviously been extensively covered and debated in theAssembly and in various other international forums.But some of them need to be mentioned again. Thetransition of poor countries from continued dependenceon international charity to self-reliance is contingent oncertain factors such as free and open trade. Agriculturaland other commodities from developing countries needto gain access to Western markets without unnecessarybarriers. It is ironic and morally unacceptable thatproducts from the West are freely offloaded onto ourmarkets but not the other way round. Fair trade is atwo-way transaction  and every endeavour must bemade to ensure that it remains so.On an optimistic note  we welcome thecommendable progress that has been achieved in aneffort to bring some conflicts in Africa to resolution.This engenders the hope for the eventual restoration ofstability and a chance for decisive peace on thecontinent. The ceasefire agreement reached on 4 Aprilthis year in Angola and the peace agreement signed on30 July between Rwanda and the Democratic Republicof the Congo represent notable historic milestones inbringing to an end the conflicts in the Great Lakesregion. I am confident that the United Nations will usethat opening to step forward  as it always has  tostrengthen its involvement and that of the internationalcommunity to consolidate those agreements and closelymonitor their implementation.I take this opportunity to congratulate the peopleand the Government of East Timor on their attainmentof independence after many decades of dehumanizingsubjugation. My Government also welcomes EastTimor's coming membership in the United Nations.In the same vein  I congratulate Switzerland onits admission to the membership of the United Nations.The significance of this historic development to theworld body cannot be over-emphasized  especiallygiven the invaluable contribution the Government andpeople of Switzerland have made over the years to theprogressive development of international humanitarianand human rights affairs.My Government is concerned at the unrelentingbloodletting in the Middle East  particularly thesenseless carnage among innocent civilians. Weencourage both the Israeli Government and thePalestinian Authority to give peace a chance throughdialogue. We call  in particular  for the cessation ofhostilities  provocation and incitement  which onlyserve to inflame the delicate conflict situation.Malawi believes in the principle of universality ofhuman rights. One of the basic rights that everymember of the global community can expect to enjoy isthe right to freedom of association. It is on the basis ofthat  and in a spirit of reconciliation  that Malawibelieves that the United Nations should seriouslyreconsider the question of the readmission of theRepublic of China. The more than 21 million people ofTaiwan should be allowed to freely participate in theaffairs of the United Nations without any hindrance  asthat is what this Organization stands for. After all Taiwan  through its rapid growth in the economic political and social sectors has demonstrated that it hasa lot to offer for the good of humanity through theUnited Nations.Africa is on the threshold of a new beginningaimed at making a lasting clean break with the errorsand political missteps of the last five decades. Thepromulgation of a development blueprint  the NewPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) provides a very comprehensive  clear focused road mapfor economic revitalization of the African continent.NEPAD  as a framework for development  containsbroad-ranging measures and actions that are reflectiveof a new vision for long-term developmentrequirements  as well as constructive and beneficialparticipation in regional  international and othermultilateral processes for effective integration ofAfrica into the global political and economic order.31It is gratifying  therefore  that the internationalcommunity is willing to support this newly emergingpragmatic framework for partnership and ownership ofdevelopment on the continent. I would like  once again to encourage our development partners to join in andsupport Africa's new quest for economic recovery andsustainable development.In conclusion  Malawi  along with other Africancountries  would like to express deep gratitude to theleaders of the Group of 8 countries for voicingunequivocal support for NEPAD. We are thankful forthe creation of the Group of 8 Africa Action Planadopted at the recent Summit in Kananaskis in Canada which will operate as the platform for enhancedcooperation and partnership between Africa and theindustrialized Group of 8 countries. We are confidentthat strong international networking and support forNEPAD will provide a solid basis for growth andprogress  as well as decisive peace and politicalstability in Africa."
"121",4993,"MYS",57,2002,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating you on your election as President of thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I amconfident that given your vast experience anddiplomatic skills you will be able to steer this sessionto a successful conclusion.I would also like to pay tribute to yourdistinguished predecessor  His Excellency Mr. HanSeung-soo of the Republic of Korea  for theoutstanding manner in which he conducted the work ofthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.In addition  I would like to take this opportunityto welcome the Swiss Confederation as the 190thMember of our family of nations. We are confident thatits membership  which formalizes its long involvementwith the United Nations  will contribute enormously tothe work of the Organization. We look forward towelcoming our newly independent neighbour  the7Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste  as the 191stMember of the United Nations in the very near future.Malaysia would also like to congratulate Africaon the establishment of the African Union and on itsbold new initiatives  such as the New Partnership forAfrica's Development.I also thank the Secretary General for hisstatement before the General Assembly. Malaysiashares his concerns over the four issues identified asthreats to world peace.A year has passed since the evil and cowardlyattacks against the Organization's host country. As aresult  the world has changed fundamentally in manyways. The international community has beengalvanized into fighting all forms of terrorism. There isgreater recognition that terrorism is a global problemthat crosses borders and lurks in many of our countries often without our knowledge.The Security Council has taken prompt actionresulting in mandatory measures aimed at eliminatingall forms and manifestations of terrorism and requiringMember States to take legal  administrative  financialcontrol and other law enforcement measures. Malaysiasupports that action and reiterates its commitment tocomprehensively fighting terrorism in all its forms atthe domestic  regional and international levels.Domestically  our Government has acted swiftlyand decisively against terrorist groups that havethreatened both our national security and internationalsecurity. We have cooperated extensively at thebilateral level by sharing intelligence information andby implementing measures to cripple transnationalcrime networks that abet terrorist activities. In theSoutheast Asian region  Malaysia and its partners inthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations haveembarked on a programme of collaboration to deal withthe issue at the regional level. At the internationallevel  in addition to our support of United Nationsactions and other international and bilateral efforts tofight terrorism  Malaysia works closely with themember States of the Organization of the IslamicConference and of the Commonwealth.However  Malaysia believes that in our quest tocombat terrorism  the norms and principles ofinternational law should not be set aside. We alsobelieve that in dealing with the menace  it is importantfor the international community to forge a broadconsensus on what constitutes terrorism. Without aclear and common definition  certain perpetrators ofterrorist acts will justify their actions in the name ofState security or national liberation.If the collective effort of the internationalcommunity to win the fight against terrorism is tosucceed  we must start looking at the problem in acomprehensive manner and must respond with acomprehensive strategy. It seems that in our urgency toaddress the problem  we overlook and continue toignore why it exists in the first place. We forget that however unjustified  terrorism is often rooted inpolitical and economic grievances that still have notbeen adequately addressed. The fight against terrorismis not merely a fight against the perpetrators andconspirators of terrorist acts; it is also a fight againstpoverty  injustice  subjugation and illegal occupationthat breed anger and hatred. There can be nocomprehensive victory against terrorism if the rootcauses of terror are not eliminated.Malaysia also regrets the continued association incertain quarters of Islam and Muslims with terrorism as if one were synonymous with the other. We wouldlike to reiterate that no race or religion should becondemned or discriminated against simply becausesome misguided people from that community are  ormay have been  involved in terrorist activities.Just as it is easy and convenient to hold amonolithic view of the Muslim world and thereforeassume the worst about every adherent of the Islamicfaith  it is also easy for Muslims to have a similarlymonolithic and therefore incorrect view of othercivilizations. If we continue to view each other in suchterms  the confidence that has been engendered in theinternational community in our fight against terrorismcan be eroded.It is with those considerations in mind thatMalaysia continues to call for the convening of a high-level international conference under the auspices of theUnited Nations to examine the terrorism issue in all itsforms and manifestations and to formulate a jointresponse to this global threat.Malaysia is concerned at the apparent lack ofurgency in addressing the underlying factors that leadto cause terrorism. For example  most of the Muslimworld believes that one of the key outstanding issuesthat continue to elicit resentment and fury is thesituation in the Palestinian occupied territories.8Malaysia believes that  while all acts of violenceagainst innocent civilians — whether inflicted bysuicide bombers or by security forces — must becondemned  we must be even-handed in our approachin dealing with the situation in the region. It isimportant that we understand the root causes ofviolence there. We must put it in its proper context: thecontinued occupation of Arab lands by the Israelioccupying forces  in particular the demolition ofPalestinian homes  the devastation of their towns andcities  the destruction of their livelihood andinstitutions and  worst of all  the loss of thousands ofcivilian lives and the wounding of tens of thousandsmore over the decades  which can only result inreactions from the Palestinian people. Israel'soppressive policies and practices have made life for thePalestinians unbearable and have engendered onlyhatred and resentment against the occupying Power illegal settlers and those who are perceived to providesupport to them. Israel must take advantage of theacceptance of the two-State solution and recognize thatpolitical and security issues must be looked at together.It must also acknowledge the need for theestablishment of an international protection force toseparate the two parties.The international community  including theUnited Nations  cannot afford to stand on the sidelinesindefinitely. It is time for the Security Council tobecome more actively involved and intervene directlyin the situation  beginning with the dispatch of aUnited Nations or other international peacekeepingforce to the occupied territories. Failure to act will onlyperpetuate the violence and exacerbate the resentmentfelt by the Palestinians — and by the Muslim world ingeneral — towards those who are perceived to beresponsible for refusing to address this issue in a fairand just manner.We are pleased that Afghanistan is now on thethreshold of becoming a viable  progressive anddemocratic State. However  many impediments tonational unity and cohesion remain. These must beovercome through sustained international support and more importantly  through the political will andcommitment of the people of Afghanistan themselves.Such support should take the form of increasedinfusion of development funds and other forms ofassistance and  more urgently  the promotion of a moresecure environment in the whole country. We owe it tothe long-suffering Afghan people to assist in therehabilitation of their country and to ensure that thecircumstances that led to their civil strife are removedand that they will not be abandoned once theimmediate task of removing terrorist elements inAfghanistan is completed.If the international community does not focus itsefforts on comprehensively fighting terrorism byattempting to find a credible settlement between thePalestinians and the Israelis  and on nation-buildingefforts in Afghanistan  it risks being dragged intoopening up battle fronts that could result in greaterinstability in the world and hamper efforts atcombating terrorism.In particular  we remain concerned that targetingIraq outside the framework of the United Nations andin contravention of international law would not only bewrong  but result in a more volatile world order. In thisregard  we welcome the decision of the United Statesto work with the United Nations to address this issuerather than pursue a unilateral policy of militaryintervention.Malaysia agrees that the United Nations must notbe cast aside. Engaging the international communitythrough the United Nations  however  must not bemerely an exercise in public diplomacy. Theinternational community cannot be made to assumethat military intervention against Iraq  in pursuit ofboth disarmament and regime change  is inevitable andthat the United Nations is being engaged only as amatter of course.The strength and relevance of this Organizationhas never come from affirming the unilateral designs ofone Member nation; rather  it rests on the collectivewill of the international community that emerges froma multilateral process. Engaging the internationalcommunity means initiating this consensual approach which can address security concerns  withoutdestabilizing the region  within the norms ofinternational law.In this effort  it is imperative that theinternational community be presented with clear andincontrovertible evidence of the perceived threat posedby Iraq to regional and international security. At thesame time  every diplomatic and political effort shouldbe made to urge Iraq to fully cooperate with the UnitedNations  including by allowing the return of UnitedNations weapons inspectors  and to comply withSecurity Council resolutions  as every State Member of9this Organization must do  so as to facilitate aresolution to this issue.A pre-emptive attack against Iraq without anycredible evidence being provided to the internationalcommunity of the threat it poses will have seriousimplications for the international campaign againstterrorism. Such an attack may produce real cleavagesand draw imaginary battle lines between the Muslimworld and the West  especially if the continuedoppression of the Palestinians remains unattended-to.Such an attack could swell the ranks of thediscontented in the Muslim world. It would provide apretext for depraved extremist groups bent on stokingthe flames of populist radicalism to mobilize andmultiply. While it is important  therefore  to view theIraq issue in terms of regional security  it is equallyimportant to understand the broader consequences thatwill follow.In our interdependent world  the need tostrengthen the multilateral process is now more urgentthan ever if we are to achieve our common goal of ajust and humane international order based oninternational cooperation and solidarity.The broader membership of this Organization hasa vital stake in ensuring the centrality of themultilateral process as embodied by the United Nationsand its specialized and affiliated agencies. Through it the Members of the Organization can articulate theirconcerns and exercise their collective will in theprotection and promotion of their interests. It istherefore important to ensure that the Organization andall that it stands for are not set aside on the basis ofexpediency or the exigencies of the moment. In thiscontext we are reassured by the Secretary-General'semphasis on the imperative of the multilateral process.As the country that will hold the forthcomingchairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Malaysia will work together with other NAM membersto ensure the continued centrality of this process including the promotion of their development agenda.In this context  we must continue to exert ourcombined efforts to ensure that globalization works forthe benefit of all. In order to achieve this  we will haveto create an international environment that is moreconducive to satisfying the legitimate developmentpriorities and needs of developing countries  as well asto addressing the economic imbalances prevailing inthe world today.The United Nations has a pivotal role instrengthening the multilateral process. It is ironic thatin an era of enormous economic  financial andtechnological resources and capabilities  the world iswitnessing a dangerous crisis of confidence in thecredibility of multilateralism as a result of certainnegative trends in the international system.This challenge must be squarely and urgentlyaddressed and remedial action taken here at the UnitedNations and in other relevant international forums. It isthe expectation of States Members of the Organizationthat the United Nations will play a crucial and leadingrole in all of these efforts. Therein lies the continuedrelevance of the United Nations to its Member States."
"122",5020,"NAM",57,2002,"﻿I convey warmcongratulations to Mr. Jan Kavan on his unanimouselection as President of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. I am confident that  given his vastexperience and diplomatic skills  he will be able tosteer this session to a successful conclusion. In thesame vein  our congratulations and sincere appreciationgo to his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for theoutstanding manner in which he conducted the work ofthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I wishalso to take this opportunity to pay tribute to theillustrious son of Africa at the helm of theOrganization  Mr. Kofi Annan  who has taken theUnited Nations to greater heights.We join other members of our family of nationsin welcoming the Swiss Confederation as the onehundred and ninetieth Member of the United Nations.We are confident that its membership will not onlyformalize that resourceful country's long involvementwith the United Nations but contribute greatly to thework of the Organization.After a long and bitter liberation struggle  thepeople of East Timor have finally realized their right toself-determination and independence. We look forwardto welcoming the Democratic Republic of East Timoras the one hundred and ninety first Member of theUnited Nations. Just as the international communitystood by the people of East Timor in their darkest hourof need  the United Nations must now assist them intheir efforts to rebuild their country.The opening of this session of the GeneralAssembly coincided with the first anniversary of the 11September terrorist attack on the United States ofAmerica. That horrific attack met with vigorousinternational condemnation and led to a concertedcampaign by countries throughout the world to eradicateterrorism as a global scourge. All around the world 19countries  including my own  are continuing to takedomestic measures to combat international terrorism.Last week the general debate in this hall wasovershadowed by an ominous and terrifying cloud —the threat of war in Iraq. Indeed  most of us have beenfilled with grave concern about that looming danger.That concern has  however  been somewhat eased. Thefocus now seems to have moved away from thetemptation to take unilateral military action towards themultilateralism that is so vital for the maintenance ofworld peace and security. In this regard  Namibiawelcomes the decision by Iraq to cooperate with theSecurity Council.Namibia is deeply concerned about the constantlyescalating violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The continuous wanton destruction of Palestiniantowns  the demolition of homes and institutions and above all  the unabating loss of life are allmanifestations of the tragic plight of the Palestinianpeople. While rejecting all acts of violence againstinnocent civilians  we recognize the urgent need for theinternational community to address the root cause ofviolence  namely  the continued occupation ofPalestinian territory by Israeli troops.It is imperative for the international communityto act decisively and with a renewed sense of urgencyto stop the ongoing carnage and destruction in theMiddle East. We support the immediate establishmentof an independent Palestinian State  existing side byside with Israel in peace and mutual security.One of the factors which have militated againstdevelopment and progress in Africa has been the armedconflicts in a number of countries on that continent.Such conflicts have been responsible for theaggravation of poverty and the spread of disease.It is pleasing to note  however  that peace andsecurity in Africa have been increasing over the pastyear or so. Developments in Angola since February thisyear have filled us with hope and a sense of relief.After more than two decades of destructive war Angola is firmly and irreversibly on the road to peace.Concerted efforts by the international community are however  required to address the urgent and burninghumanitarian needs and to help Angola to maintain andconsolidate its hard-won peace.There have been similar positive developments inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. The ceasefirethere has been holding. However  the aggressorcountries have still not withdrawn their troops fromthat country in line with the Lusaka CeasefireAgreement  the Pretoria Agreement and the relevantSecurity Council resolutions.The United Nations has confirmed  throughvarious reports  that there continue to be large-scaleviolations of human rights in the eastern part of thatcountry. This is unacceptable and should not beallowed to continue with impunity. Similarly  theplundering of the natural resources of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo should no longer be condoned.Furthermore  in Sierra Leone the machine guns with their staccato sound  have fallen silent  thanks tothe intervention of the international community in theconflict in that country. Successful elections were heldthere this year  and the people of that country are nowbusy with peace-building and the reconstruction oftheir country. We call on the international communityto assist them in this regard.In 1992  the General Assembly decided in favourof a referendum in Western Sahara. Ten years later  thepeople of Western Sahara continue to endure suffering waiting and hoping for the implementation of theUnited Nations plan for the independence of theircountry. The only hope they have is our Organization.We  the Members of the United Nations  therefore havea responsibility towards the people of Western Saharain their quest for self-determination. It is not a questionof our doing them a favour. Rather  we have anobligation under the Charter of our Organization.It is high time that the people of Western Saharaexercise their right to self-determination andindependence through a free and fair referendum underthe supervision of the United Nations. The Secretary-General should therefore continue to seek theimplementation of the United Nations independenceplan for Western Sahara.The unilateral economic blockade against Cuba iscontinuing to cause immense suffering to the people ofCuba  who suffered with us and shared with usselflessly  extending solidarity to our people during ourdifficult struggle for independence. We reiterate ourcall for the lifting of this embargo.Just as the people of Africa have begun  inearnest  to address the problem of armed conflict thathas hindered Africa's development and socio-economic20progress in the past  the continent must now grapplewith yet another menace that is ravaging its population namely  the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Its devastatingimpact is now undermining economic growth anddevelopment in sub-Saharan Africa  with millionsalready infected and dying. Indeed  sub-Saharan Africais now facing a human crisis of monumentalproportions. Millions of AIDS orphans are screamingout for help as a result of this rampaging disease.We appeal for increased and generouscontributions to the Global Health Fund to enable us tofight the scourge. In that connection  we would like toemphasize that the allocation of the available fundsshould be determined by the magnitude of the problemin each country.As part of our ongoing effort to fight the scourgeof HIV/AIDS  Namibia will be hosting the SecondRegional Conference on Orphans and VulnerableChildren from 25 to 29 November  2002. It is oursincere hope that the Conference will further highlightthe fate of those children and galvanize the world'sfurther support to ease their truly difficult plight. Weare quite confident that the support of the internationalcommunity will enable us  indeed  humanity  andAfrica in particular  to conquer this ravaging pandemic.The drought situation in Southern Africa placesmore than 12 million people at risk of hunger anddestitution. We welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General in that respect. We also welcome the efforts ofthe donor community in mobilizing resources for relief.Our sincere thanks and appreciation also go to all thehumanitarian agencies providing support. Weencourage them to continue to mobilize and to renderfurther support.The fifty-seventh session of the General Assemblyhas special significance for Africa  in the sense thatconsiderable attention is being paid to the continent'sproblems. In the first instance  there is the tabling by theSecretary-General of the report on the final review andappraisal of the implementation of the United NationsNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.This session also marks the end of the United NationsProgramme for the Second Industrial DevelopmentDecade for Africa. The conclusions of the review aresobering in the sense that both the New Agenda for theDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s and theProgramme for the Second Industrial DevelopmentDecade for Africa have come to an end  but Africaremains marginalized in the global economy.Also significant for Africa at this session is thefact that notwithstanding the continent's rather minimaldevelopment performance during the periods justreferred to  Africa has come to the fifty-seventh sessionof the General Assembly more determined then ever tolaunch itself on a new path of economic growth anddevelopment.It was in the light of this determination that onMonday  16 September 2002 the General Assemblydevoted the whole day to exploring ways in which theinternational community can support the AfricanUnion's New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD)  designed to rebuild and rejuvenate ourcontinent. What emerged from the Monday meeting onAfrica was a clear sense of purpose and direction suchthat  while hoping for greater support from theinternational community to implement its newdevelopment initiative  Africa is seriously seeking tolift itself up by its own bootstraps.Indeed  the African leaders have reaffirmed theircommitment to the development goals of the UnitedNations Millennium Summit Declaration for thecontinent to achieve economic growth of 7 per cent bythe year 2015 and thus to be able to halve poverty onthe continent by that same year.And while NEPAD is an African initiative  ownedand managed by the African Union  the continent stillneeds unfettered market access for its goods  increasedforeign investment  the elimination of external debtsand  yes  more Official Development Assistance  aswell as a large infusion of technology and skills into itsproduction processes.In conclusion  I would like to state Namibia'sposition on the International Criminal Court (ICC). Afew individuals who commit heinous crimes againsthumanity undermine international peace and security.When those who commit serious crimes go unpunished murder and torture carry no risk. Rather  theyencourage even more crimes. The entry into force ofthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Courton 1 July 2002 represents a historic day forinternational justice.As a State Party to the ICC  Namibia has notedwith great concern the adoption of Security Councilresolution 1422 (2002) under chapter VII of the United21Nations Charter  as if the ICC were a threat to peace or anact of aggression. In this context  we call upon thoseStates that are not Parties to the Statute to become so now.In the face of a growing tendency towardsunilateralism  the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly  which is the collective decision-makingbody  is becoming even more important. In the samevein  Namibia reaffirms its position on the need toreform and democratize the United Nations SecurityCouncil in order to ensure that the Council remainsresponsible for the peace and security of all countriesin all regions.From this very rostrum  it has been said time andagain that if the United Nations did not exist  it wouldhave to be created. Those are not empty words. Rather they express the deep aspirations and commitment ofhumanity to the Organization  which has stood the testof time and proven indispensable to the conduct ofrelations among States. Let us not allowmultilateralism to be eroded."
"123",5065,"NER",57,2002,"﻿My delegation would like to say that the leadershipshown by the President in presiding over this sessionmakes us confident that our deliberations will continuein a spirit of dynamism and optimism for thedevelopment of international relations. Niger is veryhappy to convey to the President and to other membersof the Bureau of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly our heartfelt congratulations.We remain convinced that President Kavan willfollow up the remarkable work done by hispredecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic ofKorea  with the same human qualities for the good ofthe international community as a whole.I wish to reiterate to our brother  His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  the congratulations of the people of Niger forthe prestige and effectiveness of his deeply appreciatedwork done in the service of humanity.I also wish to congratulate the SwissConfederation on becoming a new Member  and Timor-Leste  as an imminent Member of the Organization. Weare convinced that their participation will help enrichour debates.The American people have been mourning thetragic events of 11 September 2001 for a year now. Thewhole world has taken full measure of the threat thatterrorism poses to peace and security. In Niger  wecannot stress the fact enough that  in order to beeffective  the fight against terrorism must avoid takinga piecemeal approach. It must be long term and it mustbe conducted within the framework of internationallegality  which is epitomized by the United Nations.22Niger agrees with the provisions of SecurityCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001)  andit is firmly committed to all subregional  regional andinternational initiatives aimed at combating terrorismin all its forms.At the same time  in order to succeed in the fightagainst terrorism  we must take into account the needto develop a more just and equitable economic andpolitical order  since it has been shown that poverty ignorance  injustice and all kinds of frustrations arefactors that can produce blind extremism.Speaking of international peace and security  I ampleased to recall that Niger is a peaceful country thatcontributes actively to efforts to achieve general andcomplete disarmament. In that regard  I would like topoint out that in that field  my country  pursuant toarticle 3 of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  has accepted an agreement with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency  on a system ofmonitoring and safeguards for its uranium production.Regarding conventional weapons  Niger is happy thatthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade inSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects hasadopted a programme of action to combat that scourge.Our concerns were taken into account in theBamako Declaration  but there is still work to be done particularly in terms of technical and financialassistance measures to support disarmamentprogrammes and reintegration programmes for formercombatants. While it is true that no region of the worldhas been spared  there is no doubt that developingcountries  particularly African countries  are the onessuffering the most from the devastating effects of theproliferation of light arms and small weapons in termsof their security  stability and development. That iswhy the bodies charged with monitoring  detecting andprosecuting infractions committed along those linesmust be strengthened.Since 1994  Niger has had in place the NationalCommission for Collecting and Controlling IllicitWeapons  whose task is to help the political authoritiesat the highest level identify  design and put implementstrategies to fight the proliferation of light weapons.In that context  the Government of Niger and theDepartment for Disarmament Affairs of ourOrganization are cooperating closely for the success ofa project to collect illegal small arms and lightweapons for the entire West African subregion. That isa part of the regional and subregional initiatives aimedat cutting off the illicit movement of small arms andlight weapons.The peace that we wish for Niger is the samepeace we wish for the rest of the world. That is whyour country has always tried to make its modestcontribution to settling conflicts that threaten peace andsecurity in Africa and throughout the world. In spite ofour limited resources  we have sent contingents toLiberia  Sierra Leone  Guinea-Bissau  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and civilian police officers toHaiti  Timor and Kosovo  to support the efforts of theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) and the international community to restoreand consolidate peace.The Government of Niger reaffirms its ongoingavailability to send contingents to all United Nationspeacekeeping operations.For a few months now the internationalcommunity's attention has been focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  whose peace process is now moreparalysed than ever. Niger wants once again to reaffirmbefore the Assembly that a permanent settlement of theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict necessarily requiresestablishing the inalienable rights of the Palestinianpeople  including the creation of an independent sovereign and viable Palestinian State. On the basis ofthat conviction and in light of all kinds of false startsthat have characterized the peace process in Palestineand the Middle East  Niger has made a sovereigndecision to break off its diplomatic relations withIsrael  which continues to deny the Palestinian peopletheir legitimate right to self-determination.In Western Sahara  the Republic of Nigersupports the efforts of the United Nations  on one hand to enforce the settlement plan and  on the other hand the relevant Security Council resolutions  in order toachieve a just and comprehensive settlement of theconflict. The laudable action of the Secretary-Generaland his Personal Envoy  Mr. James Baker  should befollowed up and supported until a positive conclusionis achieved  in accordance with the relevant UnitedNations resolutions.In that context  we think that United Nationsresolutions on Jammu and Kashmir must be speedilyimplemented so that the Kashmiri people can exercisetheir right to self-determination  which would allow todefuse that hotbed that involves two nuclear States —23India and Pakistan — and to avoid a serious threat topeace and security in the South Asia region. Therefore Niger  a member of the contact group established bythe Organization of the Islamic Conference  reiteratesthe appeal already made to the two parties to step uptheir negotiations in order to achieve a peacefulsettlement of that conflict.Niger  like almost all African countries  faces anumber of major challenges  which require theinternational community to provide the necessarysupport to help them in the search for solutions and inconsolidating their economic renewal programme.From that standpoint  the developmental strategy thatwe have implemented gives priority to the culture andthe promotion of good governance through a good-conduct mechanism and public affairs management thatfocuses on concerns such as transparency and civilsociety participation in all socio-economic decisions.This is the time to sincerely thanks all the bilateral andmultilateral partners of Niger  particularly the UnitedNations institutions  for having been kind enough tocontinue to support the efforts of my country to createan institutional environment conducive to giving ussocial peace. That assistance is much appreciated andis necessary in this critical phase of the nationalconstruction process.In economic terms  never before has mankind hadso much wealth and potential overall to generatecommon benefit. The positive world economicsituation could give us hope to establish a more justeconomic order that would be more conducive topoverty reduction. In that regard  Niger welcomes thenew partnership  the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  and we believe that thatprogramme  which crystallizes the hopes of ourcontinent today  must be aimed at bringing together thenecessary conditions and means for the effectiveparticipation of all African countries to themultidimensional developmental process within theframework of the African Union.Poverty is an affront that can no longer betolerated in a world of abundance that has the means tovanquish it if there is the necessary political will.Today  we must note that 52 per cent of people wholive on less than a dollar a day are found in Africa which is the most indebted part of the world.A clear look must be taken at globalization which in the 1990s gave rise to hopes but today is asource of concern because of the growing inequalitiesit is creating. In less than a year  we have discussedglobal problems four times  and we know the trueremedies. We need a more elevated concept ofinternational cooperation that draws its essence fromstrategic partnership. However  we can rejoice in theunanimous will that the international communityaffirmed in adopting the Johannesburg Plan of Actionin September.The special session of the General Assemblydevoted to HIV/AIDS  held in July 2001  demonstratedeloquently our degree of awareness of the terribledanger that that disease represents for the humanspecies. The establishment of a special fund to fightAIDS is an important step in the world crusade againstAIDS and other major epidemics. Progress must bemade within the framework of initiatives undertaken bythe world Summits held at Cairo  at Copenhagen and atBeijing.My country expects a greater degree of solidarityfrom the industrialized countries  particularly withregard to increasing the volume of official developmentassistance  a traditional development source. At thesame time  we must unite our efforts to mobilizefinancial resources and to establish a humanitarianfund under United Nations auspices. It is indispensableand urgent that we reverse the trend of decliningofficial development assistance  which  the Assemblywill recall  is at its lowest level in 50 years. In fact many difficulties have conspired to keep our countriesat the bottom of the human development index. Thestate of poverty affects 63 per cent of our compatriots and 34 per cent of them live below the extreme povertyline. Those populations  deprived of minimal basicsocial services  are the victims of a continueddeterioration in their standard of living.The growing scarcity of financial resources hascaused  among other things  a drastic decline in publicinvestment  particularly in the social sectors  thusdepriving 80 per cent of Niger's rural citizens of basicsocial benefits. Niger has decided to undertakemeasures to reverse that trend through its povertyreduction strategy  which was formulated andimplemented after a participative process. Its goal is tosubstantially reduce the suffering of 80 per cent of thepopulation. That strategy is now the only frame ofreference for Niger's economic  financial and socialpolicies.24This year  under the direct supervision of thePresident of the Republic  we have launched anextensive programme  called Special Programme 2001 which consists of building 1 000 classrooms  1 000dispensaries and 100 mini-dams to fight poverty. Agood part — more than 80 per cent — of that operationhas already been completed.I should also like to express again from thispodium our deep appreciation for the support that ourdevelopmental partners have continued to give us forthe implementation of our National FrameworkProgramme to fight poverty  which Niger formulatedand which is among our highest priorities. However the crucial problem of African debt  which isannihilating all our development efforts  calls for aneffort by the entire international community to help usto implement — without delay or any conditions otherthan those of good governance — satisfactory policiesand mechanisms for its solution.The United Nations remains the best instrumentfor helping us realize the new world order to which weall aspire  so long as we carry forward the so-calledquiet revolution begun by the Secretary-General fouryears ago. In conclusion  I should like to express thefull confidence that Niger and its people place in theUnited Nations  which remains an institution of hopebased on the principles of justice  equity  peace andprogress."
"124",5111,"NGA",57,2002,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment and people of Nigeria  I join otherdelegations in congratulating Mr. Kavan on his electionas president of the fifty-seventh session of the UnitedNations General Assembly. I have no doubt that  underhis able leadership  the work of this session will beguided to a successful conclusion. Let me alsoacknowledge the work done by his predecessor  whoguided the affairs of the fifty-sixth session with greatskill and commitment.The tireless efforts of our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  on behalf of our Organization mustnot go unnoticed. He deserves our profuseappreciation.I welcome the newest member of ourorganization  Switzerland. I have no doubt that thisnation will bring unique perspectives to the work of theUnited Nations  which will enhance the attainment ofits objectives.It is regrettable that international terrorismcontinues to pose a threat to international peace andsecurity. There is a need for reviewed and concertedefforts on our part to confront the menace until thethreat is halted. The various international instrumentsaimed at combating terrorism deserve our full support.Nigeria remains deeply committed to the fight againstterrorism. We are committed to the early elaboration ofa comprehensive convention on international terrorism.Despite the best intentions and efforts of theinternational community  a scourge of a different naturecontinues to threaten many parts of the world. I referhere to the numerous theatres of conflict around theworld. People continue to expend valuable energies andresources in fighting each other  often for causes thatare unproductive. The international community has aresponsibility  not only to design appropriate strategiesfor a measured and early response to snuff out theseconflicts  but also to find ways and means of2addressing their root causes  and managing them to apeaceful conclusion. Only then will true peace andstability reign in the world.While it is true that many of these conflicts havetheir root causes in poverty  ignorance  real andperceived injustice and the absence of basic freedoms it is equally evident that they are often exacerbated especially in the case of African conflicts  by the influxof small arms into the continent. Illicit trade in smallarms and light weapons has continued unabated  withdisastrous consequences for many developingcountries. We are deeply concerned that manufacturingcountries are not doing enough to limit theproliferation of these weapons through appropriatesafeguards. We  therefore  call on the internationalcommunity to consider elaborating a legally bindinginternational instrument to control the supply of theseweapons to non-State actors.The United Nations peacekeeping role is aninvaluable one in the global effort to help contain andresolve conflicts around the world. It deserves to besustained and strengthened. Nigeria is proud to be anactive participant in this peacekeeping andpeacemaking effort. We remain committed to thisresponsibility in the conviction that we are ourbrother's keeper and in the knowledge that there can beno development without peace and stability.The situation in the Middle East continues to posea serious threat to international peace and security. Wereaffirm our commitment to the right of the Palestinianpeople to their own independence  as well as the rightof the State of Israel to exist within safe and secureinternational borders  consistent with Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We thereforewelcome the vision and the engagement of the Quartet as well as other sponsors of the Middle East peaceprocess. I urge the parties in the Middle East conflict tocooperate with the international community and givethe ongoing peace process a chance. That becomesimperative because we cannot afford a situation ofprotracted conflict in the subregion.Nigeria notes with concern the threat that thesituation in Iraq poses to international peace andsecurity. We hold the view that any further escalationof tension would lead to very serious consequences.Nigeria  therefore  urges the parties concerned toexercise caution and restraint and that the matter beresolved in accordance with the provisions of theCharter of the United Nations.There is no shortage of international good willand commitment to development. Various declarationsand programmes eloquently address the need for rapid durable and sustainable development  as well as thedesire for the equitable distribution of the world'swealth. In spite of this good will and good intentionson the part of the international community  more thanhalf of humanity lives in abject poverty and ignorance.For many countries in Africa  hunger and diseaseremain pervasive and deeply rooted. Humandevelopment indices for some of the poorest countriesare  indeed  unflattering for a world that is so rich butwith resources so unevenly distributed.It is our conviction that urgent  concrete action isrequired  if the lofty goals we have set for ourselves inthe Millennium Declaration to make the world a betterplace are to be realized. Many developing countriesrequire assistance from the international community inthe form of increased official development assistanceand foreign direct investment flows and efforts toalleviate their excruciating debt burden and enablethem to develop their human and material resourcebase.Africa remains committed to the attainment of thegoals of the Millennium Declaration. In that regard  Iam pleased to state that Africa is seeking to lift itselfby its own bootstraps  through the New Partnership forAfrica's Development (NEPAD). As members areaware  NEPAD is designed to address  in a sustainedand coordinated way  many of the developmentalproblems associated with Africa's underdevelopment.We are encouraged by the support that NEPADhas so far received from the international community.The latest evidence of this support is the outcome ofthe recent meeting of the Group of 8 in Kananaskis Canada  towards the implementation of the ActionPlan. It is hoped that the United Nations high-levelsegment on NEPAD would record greater successes inthe much expected endorsement of that initiative by theinternational community.This and other programmes designed to improvethe living conditions of the majority of humanity maynot yield the desired results if one of the greatestdangers facing humanity today is not addressed withthe commitment and urgency it deserves. I am speakinghere of the HIV/AIDS pandemic that continues to bring3havoc  misery and hopelessness on humanity especially in Africa where the pandemic is threateningto wipe out entire generations. For example  it isestimated that out of the 36 million people living withHIV/AIDS worldwide  75 per cent of them are in sub-Saharan Africa. The consequent toll on the human andmaterial resources of one of the most impoverishedregions of the world cannot be overemphasized. Notonly is the productive population of Africa beingsystematically decimated by HIV/AIDS  but efforts tocombat this and other diseases  such as malaria tuberculosis and other infectious diseases  are alsodiverting scarce resources away from developmentprogrammes and projects. Massive assistance istherefore required from the international community tocomplement the efforts of individual countries.Nigeria will spare no effort to combat thesescourges. While we are fully aware of the insidiousnature of all of these pestilences  the spread of HIV/AIDS constitutes by far our greatest source of concern.For that reason  Nigeria is active in contribution to andmanagement of the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS.We have also established a national agency forthe prevention and control of HIV/AIDS to coordinatethe Government's multisectoral approach to theprevention  control and management of the pandemic.We pledge to continue to do our best in this humanstruggle against this powerful  destructive force especially by generating awareness in the countryabout its prevention and spread. We continue  however to count on the international community to find curesfor these diseases  as well as to give assistance to manyof our countries in these efforts. The leadership of theUnited Nations is critical to the success of theseefforts.I wish once again to draw the Assembly'sattention to the pernicious issue of corruption and itsmanifestation at the international level. We havealways maintained that it takes two to tango and thatthe instances of corruption in developing countrieshave often been supported by encouragement  andinducements and the provision of safe havens by theindustrialized countries. Thus  we are stronglyadvocating that efforts to establish a convention againstcorruption need to be expedited  so that we can haveglobal action against corruption.There is no doubt that the United Nations hasserved humanity well. It has come a long way since itshumble beginnings in 1945. It remains the onlyorganization to which all nations  in varying degreesand ways  are associated and committed. Humanity isthe better for the existence of the United Nations. TheOrganization provides the basis for our collectivesecurity  international cooperation and solidarity  whichare essential for human coexistence. We must thereforecontinue to fine-tune its implementations to make itmore responsive to the needs of the times and toprepare it for the challenges of the future  some ofwhich could not have been envisaged by the foundingMembers.I am pleased to note that there is generalagreement among us on the need to reform theOrganization so as to make it more democratic instructure  more efficient in management and moremanageable in size. Nigeria is a major proponent of theenvisaged reforms  especially those regarding thestructure and working methods of the Security Council.Nigeria envisages a new Security Council in which itwill play the role destined by its geopoliticalcircumstances and the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury. In this regard  we are willing to contribute toefforts and stand ready to support others of like mindand circumstances in this endeavour."
"125",5156,"NIC",57,2002,"﻿I should like first of all to congratulateMr. Kavan on his election to the presidency.On 21 March at Monterrey  Mexico  the Presidentof Nicaragua  Enrique Bolaños Geyer  announced that“a process of moral renewal has been launched inNicaragua  with a crusade against public and privatecorruption”.On that same day  the President also announcedthat  in the spirit of the new era of moral renewal “a Nicaraguan judge has just found three formerofficials of the previous Government and threeother people guilty of acts of corruption thatimpoverished our people. The judge left pendingthe case against former President Alemán andeight other officials of the previous Government”.President Bolaños went on to say:“With a view to continuing my policy of zerotolerance of corruption  I must return to mycountry as soon as possible to contribute  withjustice and transparency  to the historic landmarkconstituted by this bold decision.”A few days ago  in a similar case  anothercourageous Nicaraguan judge sentenced members ofthe former President's immediate family to jail.Today  I have come before this General Assemblyon behalf of an entire people to reaffirm  in deed Nicaragua's commitment to governance  transparency accountability and to the principles of the rule of law.27There is much at stake today in Nicaragua. Notonly must we punish corrupt officials and recover forour country Government money that was diverted andlaundered  but also the results of our efforts will becrucial to the struggle waged by other peoples of ourregion and of the world against this scourge.Nicaragua's success will be an incentive for the entireinternational community. The failure of transparency inNicaragua would set a bad precedent for humankind.We have not fought this battle alone. The supportof more than 84 per cent of our population has beencoupled with the moral and economic support of manycountries  embodying the democratic values shared byus  the peoples of the United Nations. To them  to theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) andto the international organizations that have supportedus  we extend our sincere gratitude.In order to ensure that the changes we have madeare irreversible  we will need sustained and adequatesupport. In this way  we will preserve the great moralheritage of humankind — democracy exercised withhonesty and accountability.As a part of this great heritage  we are todaydiscussing human development  conceived as theState's ultimate purpose  to be attained throughdemocratic governance  economic growth and socialequity. We understand governance to be the result ofdoing things correctly in the political sphere —transparency  human rights and sovereignty. We seegrowth as the result of doing the right things in theeconomic and financial spheres  foreign exchange fiscal and monetary policies and competition. And weunderstand equity as the result of doing things right inthe social sphere — namely  in education  health housing and gender equality.Progress in bringing together these three elementsthat comprise human development will not be possibleuntil corruption is rooted out. By its very nature  thescourge of corruption has an impact that transcendsnational borders. In this regard  we offer our fullsupport to the work being carried out by the specialcommittee responsible for negotiating a United Nationsconvention against corruption. From this forum  weappeal to the international community to commit itselfto the broadest possible mutual assistance andcooperation in investigating or prosecuting acts ofcorruption.Terrorism is just as abhorrent as corruption. Thismonth we remember with anguish the tragedy of 11September  when thousands of innocent peopleperished  many of them heroically. This tragedy  likeall terrorist acts  must never be forgotten. At the sametime  international cooperation to deal with such crimesmust remain permanently on our agenda. It is essentialthat we coordinate activities to prevent and punish suchterrorist activities  which cause so much pain andsuffering  with the full force of the law.Nicaragua wishes to reaffirm once again itsunconditional support for United Nations activities tocombat international terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations. In Nicaragua  we have already set inplace a National Plan against Terrorism and RelatedCrimes  designed to strengthen cooperation amonginstitutions  and with the aim of preventing  combatingand eliminating this scourge  and complying withSecurity Council resolutions.The case of Iraq is a challenge and a test for theentire multilateral system that we have beenconstructing. It is up to us to either help strengthen itor help to weaken and fracture it. While it is true thatwe are all in favour of multilateral action  it is alsoundeniable that inertia and inaction undermineconfidence in our collective will. The multilateralsystem must demonstrate the dynamism which is itsvery raison d'être by taking joint  concerted and timelyaction to resolve conflicts.We wish to see a system capable of reacting withspecific  timely and effective measures to dangers thatthreaten international peace and security  a system thatdoes not find itself overtaken by circumstances.Nicaragua takes the view that the immediate andunconditional return of United Nations weaponsinspectors to Iraq  in a climate of completecooperation  can only be regarded as an important partof a greater effort aimed at the elimination of all kindsof weapons of mass destruction  within the context ofthe global interests of the international community andin compliance with all pertinent Security Councilresolutions.The reform of the United Nations is also part ofthe desire to respond effectively. Reform basicallyrevolves around new organizational and administrativestructures  which  without a doubt  have graduallyenabled the United Nations to act with greater unity ofpurpose  coherence and flexibility. Nicaragua  like the28Secretary-General  believes that there is still greatpotential for progress  and we must all ensure that theOrganization's work programme includes the prioritiesset out in the Millennium Declaration.No reform of the United Nations would becomplete without the long-awaited expansion of theSecurity Council in order to enable it to respond fullyand effectively to current and future needs. Similarly we must pursue efforts to revitalize the GeneralAssembly and the Economic and Social Council inorder to empower the Organization fully to assume itsresponsibilities  as enshrined in the Charter. Nicaraguashares the interest of Member States in strengtheningthe Organization  with a view to optimizing its effortsto maintain international peace and security  preventconflicts  promote sustainable development anderadicate poverty.The recent World Summit on SustainableDevelopment filled us with hope and  at the same time uneasiness. On the one hand  we saw the degree ofattention being focused on the problem ofenvironmental degradation. But  on the other hand  thepath to achieving the balance between developmentand environment is still long and arduous  particularlyfor the least developed countries. Before us lies thechallenge of generating greater wealth and more jobswithout harming our environment. We cannot achievethis without the support of the developed countries which must help pay the price of the benefits they reapfrom our efforts. Therefore  I wish to recall theMonterrey consensus  where we urged those developedcountries that have not yet done so to adopt specificmeasures to allocate 0.7 per cent of their grossdomestic product for official development assistance(ODA) to the developing countries.Nicaragua is aware that violence  civil andinternational wars  the scourge of acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)  drought andpoverty are the main problems afflicting the Africancontinent in recent years. However  we note withconcern that international cooperation and assistance toAfrica are diminishing. The efforts of AfricanGovernments to achieve economic growth and alleviatepoverty must be matched.Development efforts have also been given directexpression in Central America  where we have reachedimportant agreements and taken decisions that todayenable us to say that our region is embarking on a newera in its history. On 21 June last  in the city ofGranada  Nicaragua  we held the Twenty-FirstOrdinary Meeting of Heads of State and Governmentof Central America. This provided the opportunity toreaffirm our commitment to moving towards theconsolidation of a Central American Customs Union which will become a reality on 31 December 2003. TheCustoms Union was conceived as a means ofcontributing to the economic and social development ofour countries. It will promote smooth interregionaltrade  reduce the costs of transport owing to borderdelays  facilitate the movement of persons andvehicles  and  at the same time  attract internationalbusiness and investment to the region.Nonetheless  the prolonged halt in theinternational economic recovery was exacerbated inNicaragua by uncharacteristic problems in the externalsector  owing to the high price of imported oil and thelowest coffee prices in history.According to data provided by Gabriel Silva President of the Colombian Coffee Growers'Federation  five years ago  coffee consumers paid 30billion dollars while producers received 12 billiondollars  or 40 per cent. Today  consumers pay 65 billiondollars but producers receive only 5.5 billion dollars orless than 8.5 per cent.This critical situation  which is generatingunemployment and hunger in the productive areas ofNicaragua and other producer countries  seems to becaused by a cartel of coffee-roasters  a situation thatmust be remedied as soon as possible through measuresto promote competition in consumer markets and onthe international market.Nicaragua congratulates Switzerland on recentlyjoining the United Nations as a new Member andTimor-Leste  which is about to join. Their presenceamong us will contribute new ideas and approaches tostrengthening efforts for a better world  and —paraphrasing the representative of Switzerland'sstatement to this General Assembly — will enhance theuniversality of the United Nations in the best interest ofhumankind.In this same connection  my country  aware of theprinciple of universality and equality that inspired theUnited Nations  considers it a priority to permit the 23million inhabitants of the Republic of China on Taiwanto enjoy the universal right to participate ininternational affairs through its own delegation to the29United Nations  parallel to and with the same rights ofparticipation as the People's Republic of China  whoseGovernment has never exercised hegemony overTaiwan.Nicaragua  as a founding State of thisOrganization  reaffirms its commitment to the Charterand its aspiration to become a non-permanent memberof the Security Council during the elections to be heldduring the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.I spoke earlier of a new era of moral renewal inNicaragua rooted in the values of the United Nations. Ibelieve that when we speak of strengtheningdemocracy  reforming the Organization  fightingcorruption  terrorism and drug trafficking  halting thearms race or providing joint  timely and effectiveresponses to the dangers which threaten us  we arereally speaking of one and the same thing: belongingjointly to an Organization that holds and safeguards ourtrust and collective action based on the principles thatunited our peoples on that historic day to create theUnited Nations."
"126",5203,"NLD",57,2002,"﻿The smokeat ground zero  only a few blocks away from here  hascleared. But the empty space where the twin towersonce stood continues to send shivers throughout theworld. The unspeakable events that occurred a year agohave become engraved in our collective memory. Whatoccurred here was an unprecedented and direct attackon universal values: values such as mutual respect such as tolerance  such as the rule of law — values thatform the very basis of the United Nations.Over the past year  the world community hasproven its determination to defy terrorism. Today  theNetherlands not only reiterates its attachment to thesevalues but also underlines a responsibility  bothindividual and collective  for upholding and protectingthem. And that responsibility calls for a realcommitment.Religions  races and traditions make our worldcolourful and diverse. But underneath our differentfeathers  we share a common skin: principles we alladhere to — or should adhere to — regardless of ourreligious beliefs or race. Mutual respect  the rule oflaw  freedom of speech and religion are among themost important ones.We cannot  however  confine ourselves to merelyrestating these principles. Without real commitmentthey would quickly evaporate and thus become emptywords.It goes without saying that the Netherlands isfully committed: it is a dedicated international partner both out of choice and out of necessity  in the UnitedNations  the European Union  NATO and otherorganizations  or in common endeavours such as theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. TheNetherlands will continue to dedicate 0.8 per cent of itsannual gross domestic product to developmentcooperation and urges others to do the same.Behind that commitment is the unshakeable beliefthat no country can hope to succeed on its own inwhatever policy area. In this respect we take to heartthe wise words of Secretary-General Kofi Annan:“Even the most powerful countries know that they needto work with others  in multilateral institutions  toachieve their aims” (A/57/PV.2). We therefore alsowelcome the United States decision  announced fromthis rostrum by President Bush  to return to the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO). The Netherlands not onlyfeels an individual responsibility for the defence ofuniversal values  but a shared responsibility as well.Let me elaborate on this today in relation to four keyareas of concern: the development of the Africancontinent  uncontrolled migration  the continuing threatof terrorism and the situation in the Middle East.Africa continues its struggle towardsdevelopment and prosperity. It cannot and must not doso all by itself. We all share a responsibility foreradicating poverty and enhancing Africa's globalintegration.Too often the African continent is associated onlywith misery and instability. In reality the number ofconflicts in or between African countries hasdecreased. The creation of the African Union  and theNew Partnership for Africa's Development  testify tothe continent's own commitment. The Netherlands very15much welcomes this acknowledgement by Africanleaders of their own responsibility for building aprosperous and peaceful continent. For us  this isessential for adding our own efforts and resources toachieve that objective. It also means that Africanleaders  like all of us  can be held accountable for theirgovernance and policies  their performance in the fieldof human rights and their respect for the rule of law.In partnership with African countries theNetherlands will continue to do its share in providingthe necessary resources. For us  developmentcooperation is not just providing money  but also apolicy integrating the promotion of good governance security and stability. Is the world to assist inalleviating the effects of natural disasters when in factthey are  at least in part  man-made?Responsibility also extends to the private sector particularly when it comes to fighting the disease thatundermines all efforts at development: HIV/AIDS.However  for the fight against AIDS to be successful  itneeds to be fully endorsed by African Governments.That means: acknowledgement of the problem and itscauses  an open discussion of possible strategies andaddressing its consequences for society.Africa concerns us all. Its problems affect us all.Poverty  conflict and violations of human rightscontribute to an ever-increasing migration. Thisphenomenon is  however  by no means unique for theAfrican continent. We need to deal with it effectively regardless of whether we represent countries of origin countries of transit or those of destination. Migration isrobbing countries of origin of a vitally importantresource: human capital. For neighbouring countries orcountries of transit it can be a source of instability. Forcountries of destination  it often creates problems ofintegration.Here again  common values are at stake.Governments should do everything in their power toavoid people having no other choice than fleeing home.The number one priority is addressing the underlyingcauses of uncontrolled migration.In the meantime  we need to support the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  which is stretched to its limits dealing witha problem for which it was not devised. TheNetherlands welcomes UNHCR's efforts to establishand implement an integrated policy aimed at therepatriation of refugees  coupled with their re-integration  rehabilitation and reconstruction.Obviously  these efforts have to be dovetailed withthose of other United Nations agencies active in thoseareas.It is precisely through such an integratedapproach that we can hope to achieve results.UNHCR's mix of policy areas obviously has to becomplemented by that of security. That is one of thereasons why the Netherlands is involved inpeacekeeping or similar operations in Bosnia  theFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)and Afghanistan. Security is the quintessentialconsideration for those who are to return to theirhomes. Without security  resettlement and recoveryremain pious wishes. Money spent on security ismoney well spent.In the year following 11 September 2001 theinternational community has effectively taken itsresponsibility. Its joint efforts have focussed onbringing about more security and increased stability inAfghanistan. Much has been accomplished: a regimehostile both to the Afghan people and to our commonlyshared values has been ousted. Subsequently  ourcollective efforts have helped establish an electedGovernment and begin the reconstruction of adisrupted society.There can be no leniency towards countries thatreject universal values  because a country that rejectstolerance  endorses intolerance. A country that does notguarantee the rule of law invites anarchy and injustice.The international community must help countries thatare unable to do so themselves. It must try to persuadethose that are uncooperative and it must be ready  ifnecessary  to act against those that are unwilling.The terrorist attacks have also shown thatreligion  for some  unfortunately  is a source ofinspiration not for good  but for destructive purposes.The hijacking of planes should not result in thehijacking of an entire religion. Proper education freedom of opinion and speech  secular orrepresentative government can help contain religiousextremism. Here again  we have a collective as well asan individual responsibility for upholding andprotecting common values.What we need is a dialogue between countries civilizations and religions. But we also need action togo after the sources of religious extremism.16That same commitment leaves us no choice but tocontinue to work towards peace in the Middle East.The instability there  the lurking dangers of religiousextremism and weapons of mass destruction requireour joint dedication.The many different actors in the Middle Eastshare a duty to restrain violence and curtail extremism.Stability in the region is an indivisible interest  notonly for the region itself but far beyond. The countriesin the region have prime responsibility for ensuringthat their citizens can live in freedom and anenvironment of tolerance and respect. But theinternational community has a role to play as well.Here in particular  we expect the Security Council totake its responsibilities to end the Iraqi regime'ssystematic non-compliance with a range of earlierresolutions. The inspectors should be allowed to return yesterday rather than tomorrow. The credibility of theUnited Nations system is at stake.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be dealtwith solely by concentrating on the fight againstterrorism. Terrorism must stop  not only because of thehuman suffering it causes  but also because it is utterlycounterproductive. The Palestinian people should askthemselves where this violence has got them. On theother hand  Israel cannot defer indefinitely answeringthe question as to when and how it is to live side byside with a Palestinian neighbour. Finding a solutionagain requires true commitment from all partiesconcerned and a dialogue across regional  religious andother borders. That involves us all.In conclusion  since we share values  we shareresponsibility for upholding them. That shoulddetermine our commitment to addressing the problemsthat I mentioned. Our commonly held values shouldguide our dealings with each other — betweenindividuals as well as between countries. It is onlywhen we acknowledge what we have in common thatwe can find the strength to overcome our differences. Ifthere is one thing that our presence here  one year after11 September 2001  makes clear  it is this: our belief infreedom and tolerance is unshakeable  and so is ourcommitment to uphold them."
"127",5248,"NOR",57,2002,"﻿Yesterday we stoodunited in remembrance of all those who lost their livesa year ago. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001were an attack on us all. We  the States Members of theUnited Nations made this clear a year ago in this Hall.Today we stand united in unwavering determination inthe struggle against international terrorism and in thefight for the values  ideals and human rights that thisgreat Organization is founded upon.To succeed in our fight against terrorism  we mustmeet three crucial priorities. First of all  as terrorism isa global threat  our response must be global andcomprehensive. To succeed  the global coalition tocombat international terrorism must be maintained andfurther strengthened. We must continue our commonefforts to prevent and eradicate terrorism  and to bringthe perpetrators to justice. We must deny the terroristsaccess to weapons of mass destruction. We mustcontinue to fight terrorism with all necessary means political  diplomatic  legal  financial and military. Wemust ensure that we are fighting terrorism on our ownterms  upholding the values  the rights and thefreedoms that the terrorists so despise.Secondly  we must strengthen our common effortsto maintain peace and security. A multilateral approachto global challenges requires relevant and effectiveinstitutions. Effective multilateralism calls for a strongUnited Nations and effective regional organizations.Norway stands fully behind efforts to strengthen theUnited Nations.Thirdly  we must focus on root causes. I call onall Member States to fight extremism and fanaticism  toprotect and promote human rights  to resolve conflictsand to eradicate poverty. That is why to invest indevelopment is to invest in peace.The Millennium Declaration set out the preciseobjectives to which we all are committed. We cannotafford to fail. Development must be built on a globalpartnership  in which all partners have clearresponsibilities.At the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  held in Johannesburg a week ago  wereaffirmed our commitment to the Rio principles andagreements  to the Millennium Goals  to Doha and toMonterrey. Together these agreements and declarationshave given us a platform for renewed efforts towardsour common goal of sustainable development. TheSummit in Johannesburg also demonstrated thatpromoting development and protecting the environmentmust go hand in hand. Now it is up to us to make it allhappen. Making it happen requires that we commit toprecise and ambitious aims within the most pressingareas of concern. We tried to do so in Johannesburg especially in the areas of water  energy  health agriculture and biodiversity.Making it happen requires investment in people:education  respect for human rights  the empowermentof women  and the empowerment of the poor. We needmore equitable sharing of wealth within and amongnations.Making it happen requires courageous andenlightened leadership. Good governance isindispensable for sustainable development.Making it happen requires strong internationalinstitutions  both to monitor and to act on behalf of usall.Last but not least  making it happen requiresfinancial resources. I urge the leaders of industrializedcountries to make speedy progress towards the 0.7 percent target for official development assistance. Norwayintends to increase development assistance to 1 percent of its gross domestic product by 2005.The cycle of violence in the Middle East must bebroken. We must all help to bring the conflict out of itsdeadlock. Israel has a legitimate right to self-defence but a human disaster is unfolding before our eyes in thePalestinian areas. I urge the Palestinians to dealeffectively with the terror. The terrorist attacks mustend. I urge the Government of Israel to recommit itselfto the political process while halting militaryoperations and withdrawing its forces. Only a politicalprocess aiming at an independent Palestinian State andsecurity for Israel can lead to peace.As the country holding the chairmanship of theAd Hoc Liaison Committee  Norway is working withother donors to help rebuild economic and socialinfrastructure  while ensuring reforms in thePalestinian areas through our work in the establishedTask Force on Palestinian Reform.We must continue our assistance in the years tocome in the troubled and war-torn country ofAfghanistan. We condemn the recent attacks againstthe lawfully appointed leaders of Afghanistan. Thefight against the remaining groups of terrorists mustcontinue. I pledge Norway's continued support to22Afghanistan. As the country holding the chairmanshipof the Afghan Support Group  we have focused on theneed for both humanitarian assistance and long-termreconstruction aid. A sustained international presenceis essential. Winter is approaching  and as many as 6million people are threatened with famine. We mustalso ensure the protection of human rights  in particularthe rights of girls and women.Iraq must address the unresolved disarmamentissues in accordance with Security Council resolutions.This means immediate and unconditional cooperationwith United Nations weapons inspectors. It is up to theIraqi leadership to allay international fears and to provethat Iraq does not possess weapons of mass destruction.It is up to Saddam Hussein to step out of isolationand bring Iraq back into the world community. Politicaland diplomatic efforts to achieve these goals have notyet been exhausted. Iraq must immediately complywith United Nations demands. The responsibility fornon-compliance lies with Iraq alone. Further action bythe international community must be rooted in theUnited Nations.The international community must stay fullyengaged in resolving the conflicts that still prevail inmany parts of Africa. Parties to armed conflicts mustcontinue to show political will and ensure thatdiplomatic progress is translated into real results on theground  including in the Great Lakes region. Too manyhave suffered for too long from armed conflict.In the peace process between Ethiopia andEritrea  we have seen that progress is possible when theparties and the United Nations work closely together.The search for peace and stability in the Horn of Africamust also focus on resolving the conflicts in Somaliaand Sudan.Over the years  Norway has been activelyinvolved as a facilitator in the settlement process of anumber of armed conflicts. In Sri Lanka  we havewitnessed significant progress over the past fewmonths. A ceasefire agreement between theGovernment and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelamcame into force at the end of February. The agreementhas laid the foundation for direct political negotiations which will begin in Thailand next week.Norway is strongly committed to the protectionand promotion of human rights. Human rights are theplatform for enabling people to choose and to developtheir full potential. Respect for human rights andfundamental freedoms  the rule of law  openness anddemocracy are values and principles we share.However  common values and principles are of littlevalue if they do not lead to concrete results to thebenefit of the individual.Many of the problems we are facing are directlyrelated to the fact that the very human rights and valueswe have all committed ourselves to are not being livedup to. This we see in Burma  and in other countries aswell. As leaders  we have a responsibility to protect ourcitizens. We must focus on human security andprotection from violence. Civilians are targeted or usedas instruments of intimidation and terror. Women andchildren are increasingly vulnerable. Relief workersand others who volunteer to help people in need aresubject to deliberate attacks and acts of violence. Ourcommitment to human security means that we musteffectively apply international humanitarian law.The entry into force of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court is unprecedented. TheCourt represents a decisive step towards the end ofimpunity for the most serious crimes against humanity.We need an independent  effective and credible Court.We must work together to promote wide adherence tothe Rome Statute. The goal must be a universallyaccepted International Criminal Court  so that noperpetrator of mass killings or other crimes againsthumanity and can feel safe.Our resolve to promote social development economic growth  democracy and human rights is thestrongest means we have at our disposal in the fightagainst poverty and injustice  as well as in the long-term struggle to eradicate terrorism. We must use thefull spectrum of means and measures to securedemocracy and opportunity for every person on thisplanet. Only then can we hope to create a world inwhich there will be no more horrendous acts ofviolence  extreme aggression and terrorism.The multilateral system of cooperation can onlybe as strong and assertive as Governments want it tobe. We have a common responsibility to make it strong.We cannot think collectively and then act alone. Norcan we think in isolation and expect to act effectivelytogether. That is why we need a strong United Nations."
"128",5294,"NPL",57,2002,"﻿Let me begin by taking thisopportunity to congratulate you  Sir  on yourunanimous election to preside over the fifty-seventhsession of the General Assembly. My delegationpledges its full support to you and has full confidencein your ability to steer the session to a successfulconclusion. I would also like to express mydelegation's profound appreciation to your predecessor 9His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo  for the excellentmanner in which he guided the fifty-sixth session.Our tributes are also due to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for histireless efforts to carry out the mandate of the UnitedNations.Nepal congratulates Switzerland and welcomes itas a new Member of the United Nations. We also lookforward to having the privilege of welcoming EastTimor as a new Member in a few days.We are meeting here under the long and darkshadow of the terrorist attacks carried out against ourhost city on 11 September 2001. The trauma andtragedy the attacks wrought are still fresh in ourmemory. Our heart goes out to the children who losttheir parents and to the families who lost their near anddear ones.Itself a victim of terrorism  Nepal understands thepain and peril terrorists brutally perpetrate onindividuals and societies. As globalization andtechnological advances have made it possible forterrorists to move people and funds across the worldwith ease  the concerted efforts of nations will beessential to stamp out terrorism. We therefore supportthe ongoing global war on terrorism and see the needfor better enforcement of existing international law andfor the conclusion of a comprehensive globalconvention for that purpose. In Nepal we have enacteda new law in this regard  as well as rules andregulations that include provisions of relevantinternational treaties to which we are a party.Being opposed to democracy and freedoms  theso-called Maoist terrorists in Nepal have been takinginnocent lives  abducting children to work as childsoldiers  and destroying private homes  schools andvital infrastructure. In view of this  His Majesty'sGovernment has recognized them as terrorists and haslaunched a campaign to protect people and property.We appreciate the moral and financial support from ourfriends in this effort. We also deplore any suggestionthat tends to equate the Government's obligation toprotect its citizens with the terrorists' dastardly acts ofviolence.Even though terrorism is the menace of themoment  other peace and security problems continue totrouble the world. The Middle East is burning andAfrica is boiling over with conflict. Tension alsoabounds elsewhere — in Asia  Europe and LatinAmerica.To find comprehensive peace in the Middle East Nepal supports the time-bound implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 1397 (2002) and of theQuartet agreement of April 2002.Iraq must comply with the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  and the international communitymust respect the sanctity and integrity of the Charter ofthe United Nations in order to avoid setting fire to thewider region.We are happy that Afghanistan is limping back tonormalcy. Providing security coverage over the entirecountry should be the United Nations priority so thatreconstruction can pick up momentum.East Timor has emerged as a free South Pacificnation. We congratulate its people on their freedom andindependence  and the United Nations on helping themthrough the transition.It is encouraging that Sierra Leone has achieved ameasure of stability. In order to achieve a wider peace attempts must be redoubled to resolve the conflicts inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  Liberia andBurundi.The Balkans  Cyprus and the Korean peninsulashould receive necessary support in their quest forpeace and harmony.No durable peace will be possible without theprevention of conflicts and the resolution of disputesthrough peaceful means. Peacekeeping  disarmamentand confidence-building are the pillars of the edifice ofculture of peace. United Nations peacekeepingoperations have proved very useful in helping tostabilize fragile situations during and after conflicts.Nepal is a major player in United Nationspeacekeeping and has contributed more than 40 000military and police personnel so far. Our peacekeepershave served the United Nations with outstandingcompetence and dedication  sustaining 42 casualties inthe line of duty. Our commitment to United Nationspeacekeeping operations remains robust. Supplyingfully self-sustained troops is our goal  but that oftenbecomes difficult for a poor country. Until we achieveour goal  the United Nations must continue to bridgethe resource gap through innovative means.10In our view  the total elimination of nuclearweapons in a time-bound manner constitutes thecornerstone of the disarmament endeavour. We alsostress the imperative of observing existing internationaltreaties  ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty and concluding a fissile material cut-off treaty.Nuclear-weapon-free zones and a guarantee not to use or threaten to use  nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States  and other confidence-buildingmeasures will help the process of nuclear disarmament.Equally important is the need to eradicate chemical biological and other weapons of mass destruction.Small arms have taken more lives than any othertype of weapons. We welcome the agreement thatemerged from the United Nations Conference on theIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in AllIts Aspects last year. Nonetheless  we underline theneed for stricter controls on the possession of sucharms by non-State actors.United Nations Regional Centres for peace anddisarmament are an important tool for buildingconfidence and helping the process of disarmament intheir respective regions. We are grateful to MemberStates for having designated Nepal as host of theRegional Centre in Asia and the Pacific. It is  however deeply troubling that the Centre is yet to move toKathmandu  despite our full commitment to meeting allthose obligations that other hosts have met. We urgethe United Nations to relocate the Centre immediatelyand not to set terms and conditions over and abovethose that other hosts of similar Centres have accepted.One may argue that not all conflicts are productsof poverty. Yet people living in poverty  deprivationand despair easily become susceptible to the evildesigns of extremist elements. Hence  povertyreduction and sustainable development are aninseparable part of efforts to prevent conflicts andterrorism and to promote peace.Indeed  developing countries must bear theprimary responsibility for their own development.Nepal has undertaken far-reaching reforms to liberalizethe economy  optimize internal resources  attractforeign investment and protect the environment. Mostof its public expenditure is invested in people and inpoor areas. Measures have been taken to provide cleanGovernment and improve overall governance.However  our problems are so big and ourresources so limited that without additional resourcesand market access we cannot accelerate our growth andsustain our development. Wealthy nations willtherefore have to fulfil their commitments made at theMillennium Summit  as well as at the Doha  Monterreyand Johannesburg conferences. We appreciate thepledges of the European Union and the United States toraise the level of their development assistance and urgethem to keep their word.Developing countries also need a conduciveglobal economic climate to grow. For that to happen rich nations must strive to lift the world economy outof the current recession and agree on major reforms inthe international financial architecture.More than others  least developed countries inAfrica and elsewhere need increased assistance andsupport to break loose from their poverty trap.Developed nations should do everything in their powerto meet the official development targets  provide duty-free and quota-free access for the products of the leastdeveloped countries to their markets and helpimplement other provisions of the Brussels Programmeof Action.Landlocked developing countries suffer theconstraints of remoteness  high-cost economies andhigh transit costs. They need targeted assistance toovercome their specific hurdles  as do the small andpoor island developing States. Nepal appreciates theUnited Nations for its important role in propellingdevelopment in developing countries. We also welcomethe timely appointment of the High Representative forthe Least Developed Countries  LandlockedDeveloping Countries and Small Island DevelopingStates.Regional cooperation is a linchpin of attemptscollectively to foster competitiveness  capacity andsynergy. In South Asia  we are striving to build suchcooperation under the South Asian Association forRegional Cooperation (SAARC). Poverty alleviation trade liberalization and technical cooperation havereceived the principal focus as precursors to theultimate establishment of a South Asian economicunion. The eleventh SAARC summit  which Nepalhosted in January  is a testament to member States'eagerness not to let their political differences affect theprocess of regional economic integration.Nepal is fully committed to democracy  justiceand human rights  including those of women andchildren. We are strengthening the values andinstitutions of democracy and incorporatinginternational human rights standards into our domesticlaws. Our National Human Rights Commission is fullyfunctional and the judiciary is being revitalized.Sadly enough  there are nearly 20 millionrefugees around the world and many more internallydisplaced persons. In Nepal alone  there are over100 000 refugees from Bhutan  deprived of theirhuman rights at home. With a view to finding a durablesolution to the problem  Nepal has engaged in bilateralnegotiations with Bhutan for nearly a decade now. Wecall on Bhutan to take the negotiations as a matter ofurgency and to pave the way for the earliestrepatriation of the refugees.Friendly countries  the United Nations system —particularly the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees and the World FoodProgramme — and non-governmental organizationshave been generously assisting us in the maintenanceof the refugees. We express our appreciation to themfor their help and urge them to continue it until therefugees return home.Committed to the principles and purposes of theUnited Nations  Nepal underlines the need for UnitedNations reform  so that the Organization can meet thechallenges before it. Therefore  revitalizing the GeneralAssembly and the Economic and Social Council is ourpriority. We favour reinforcing collaboration andcomplementarity between the Economic and SocialCouncil and the Security Council in their respectiveand related areas.In our view  it is imperative to carry out a limitedexpansion of the Security Council membership in bothcategories  in a way that preserves the Council'sflexibility and ensures equitable geographicalrepresentation. Reform of its working methods mustalso continue  with a view to enhancing transparencyand improving the quality of consultations  particularlywith troop-contributing countries.Reform is equally essential within the Secretariatin order to increase its efficiency and effectiveness.Inter-agency coordination should also be upgraded.Central to strengthening the United Nations are avigorous Non-aligned Movement and a robust Group of77. As a member of both  Nepal pledges to work withother countries to reinvigorate those bodies and toexpand cooperation between them and the UnitedNations."
"129",5311,"NRU",57,2002,"﻿I bring warm greetings fromthe people of Nauru  who join me in congratulatingyou  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly  and incommending the outgoing President for his strongleadership and guidance throughout the tumultuousyear gone by.My delegation takes this opportunity tocongratulate Switzerland on becoming a full memberof the United Nations  making it the 190th MemberState in this brotherhood of nations.Much of the work of the United Nations since thelast session of the General Assembly is reflective of thestate of the world. The events of 11 September 2001and the ongoing conflicts around the world havefocused the work of this body on security issues  andthat is understandable. The Security Council's adoptionof its resolution 1373 (2001)  obligating Member Statesto implement anti-terrorism measures  has the fullsupport of the countries of the Pacific Island Forum  ofwhich we are a member.At the international level  my Government ispleased with the outcome of the first session of theAssembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court  which concluded only afew days ago.We commend with admiration the United Nationsoperation in East Timor for successfully nursing anoccupied territory and its people from despair tonationhood  with the proclamation of an independentDemocratic Republic of East Timor on 20 May thisyear.The communiqué of the 33rd meeting of thePacific Islands Forum  held in Fiji last month  sets out23wide-ranging concerns that impact the livelihood andwelfare of the peoples of the Pacific. First and foremostamong those concerns is the environment. Thecontinued degradation of the Earth's environmentcannot be ignored  in the light of the natural disastersthat are occurring in different parts of the world:flooding  earthquakes and droughts  to name but a few.There is enough scientific evidence to show that thechanges in the Earth's environment and climate arehuman-induced. The World Summit on SustainableDevelopment recently held in Johannesburg was anearnest attempt by us to remedy the situation.All of us in the Pacific region were disappointedby the lack of meaningful targets in the JohannesburgPlan of Implementation. However  we believe that thecommitments for significant new resources andpartnerships reached at the Summit will go a long wayin helping to accelerate implementation of sustainabledevelopment.Nauru is very pleased by the assured entry intoforce of the Kyoto Protocol  thanks to the commitmentsmade by India  Canada  Russia and China to ratify thatinstrument. But that is only the first step in what has tobe a universal campaign to address climate change. Wewould therefore join the call for the United States andAustralia to see their way clear  in the not-too-distantfuture  to ratifying the Protocol.Another issue of special importance to Nauru isthe health of our ocean. We are the custodians of thelargest ocean  rich in natural marine resources andminerals. The ocean also frames our cultures and is thesource of our future well-being. This is particularlytrue in the case of Nauru  which has a land area of only10 square miles and an ocean area of at least 120 000square miles. We use the ocean to provide desalinatedwater  and earn a substantial amount of our incomefrom fishing license fees. For the sake of our future the international users of our ocean space must workwith us to conserve the ocean's natural resourcesagainst unsustainable use; protect its biodiversity frompollution  including through the shipment of toxicmaterials; and ensure that island countries benefitequitably from the trade in the ocean's naturalresources  living or non-living.Just as the economies and the environment ofPacific Islanders are vulnerable to external forces  so isthe security of our peoples and Governments. Ourregion  the world's very first nuclear-free zone  has along history of supporting disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  born of the region'sharsh experience with nuclear testing by colonialpowers.I joined other Pacific Leaders last month inexpressing concern on the trans-shipment of nuclearwaste through our waters. My delegation welcomes theinitiative by Mongolia to institutionalize its territory asa nuclear weapon-free zone and will support UnitedNations action towards the realization of this goal.On the domestic front  the potential fallout on oureconomy of the OECD initiative on harmful taxcompetition is worrisome  to say the least. While myGovernment reaffirms the sovereign right of nations toestablish domestic tax regimes of their own design andchoosing  we have expressed our strong commitment todeveloping a cooperative framework within whichcountries can work together to address transparency capacity building and information exchange in relationto tax matters.We remain of the view that the only place wheremoney-laundering can be controlled effectively is atthe source. While Nauru has done all it can to date toensure that its legal and administrative system issufficient to prevent such activities  we appear toremain the subject of adverse criticism from theFinancial Action Task Force on Money-Laundering(FATF). Nauru was disappointed not to have graduatedout of the special  non-cooperating countries list. Wewill  nonetheless  continue to work on satisfying thekey players in FATF on this issue.Two most pressing issues facing my Governmentin a “post-phosphate” future are energy and the supplyof fresh water  as both have direct impacts on thestandard of living of the community. Nauru isdependent on the import of fossil fuel for its entireenergy requirement  including for the desalination ofseawater to complement catchments of rainwater.Before I conclude  Mr. President  I wish toreiterate Nauru's support for the reform of the UnitedNations Security Council  and to support calls for thisissue to continue to receive top priority. In terms of theUnited Nations itself  the ongoing administrative andbudgetary reforms by the Secretary-General arewelcome  but much more certainly needs to be done.24Nauru is disappointed to see that contributions tothe Global Health Fund are only trickling in  contraryto our enthusiastic undertaking at the Special Sessionlast year. Consequently HIV/AIDS  malaria andtuberculosis continue unabated in their destruction ofcommunities and continue to rob the manpower ofaffected nations. Nauru pledged to contribute $1 perhead of its population to the Fund  and I am pleased toannounce that this pledge has been honoured. I againcall on all Member States  rich and poor  to contribute.Finally  Mr. President  in the past two years theMillennium Summit and the Monterrey andJohannesburg Summits have illustrated the UnitedNations' increasing role as a forum for buildingconsensus. Indeed  the last twelve months have beentrying times in our efforts to build consensus ondevelopment and to maintain international peace andsecurity. The challenge facing us in this area is not somuch one of building consensus  because we all knowwhat needs to be done  but rather one ofimplementation. Achieving our lofty goals requiresaction and cooperation at all levels  from local toglobal. Mr. President  we look to you for leadership inthis decisive period and offer our steadfast support.Finally  11 September 2001 seems to be a way oflife for some people. It is now etched into history andwhat a pity. The perpetrators cannot be proud of whathappened  and we should not allow them or encouragethem to proceed on their merry way. We must pursuethe alternatives we have  as they can be a great legacyfor our children. We the small nations have faith in theUnited Nations. We the small nations have hope in theUnited Nations. Let us embrace love in its entirety  forlove is a beautiful way of living. Thank you. God blessthe United Nations."
"130",5358,"NZL",57,2002,"﻿Mr. President  may Ibegin by congratulating you on your assumption of thepresidency and assure you of New Zealand'scooperation during your term of office.13The opening of this  the fifty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly  came just one day after theanniversary of the terrorist attack of 11 September2001  which shocked this city and the internationalcommunity. The premeditated and callous mass murderof 3 000 people from 79 different countries was a sharpwarning to us of the ongoing threats to peace andstability in our world. It was to protect humanityagainst such threats that the nations of the world cametogether in 1945 to establish this Organization in thebelief that collective action was necessary to guaranteeglobal peace.Today  in the second year of a new millennium the need to act multilaterally is greater than everbefore. Terrorism  weapons of mass destruction environmental degradation  people-smuggling  drug-trafficking  diseases such as HIV/AIDS and theunsustainable depletion of our natural resources are allglobal matters that require a collective response.We can be proud that a year ago the response bythe United Nations to a new and unprecedented level ofterrorism was immediate  united and effective. Theprimary victim of the attack  the United States  soughtand secured international cooperation that achieved theincapacitation of the Al Qaeda terrorist organizationand the removal of the Taliban regime that had hostedit. It was a model for international unity of purpose andmultilateral action. It was a lesson that should not beforgotten as this Organization tackles other problemsconfronting humanity.New Zealand has worked wholeheartedly underthe mandate provided by the United Nations to defeatterrorism. We have introduced legislation to denyterrorist organizations funding and resources in linewith Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). We havesought to assist our neighbours in the Pacific to do thesame. We have committed peacekeeping personnel tothe International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) andcombat forces under Operation Enduring Freedom inAfghanistan. But we are also aware that actions tosuppress terrorism must be accompanied by measuresto tackle the causes of terrorism. Injustice  lack ofopportunity  hopelessness  desperation and the failureof legitimate channels to redress grievances all giverise to resort to terrorist actions.The failure to resolve differences between Israeliand Palestinian people in the Middle East continues tobe a catalyst for recruitment into terrorism. TheSecretary-General  in opening this session  spelled outthe basis for resolving the dispute. He referred to landfor peace  an end to terror and to occupation  and totwo States  Israel and Palestine  with secure andrecognized borders. Both peoples are destined to liveside by side. Both will benefit from an end to violenceand a negotiated settlement. But agreement requiresgood faith from each side and a determined effort bythe international community. We fully endorse theSecretary-General's renewed call for an internationalpeace conference. Progress on this issue is now morevital than ever.The situation in Iraq is also a threat to worldpeace  but we must look for solutions that will resolveand do not exacerbate that threat. No nation can beexempt from the requirement to comply with theresolutions passed by this Organization. That isnecessary if the rule of law is to apply internationally.No nation can be allowed to commit aggression or touse weapons of mass destruction against its ownpeople. The requirement to comply with UnitedNations resolutions is not the instruction of onecountry to Iraq; it is collective instruction that shouldhave the unanimous endorsement of all Membercountries.Iraq's non-compliance with Security Councilresolutions is a challenge to the entire United Nationsmembership. The United Nations must meet thischallenge. How the situation is resolved matters to usall  not least the countries of the region itself.Those who can exercise influence over Iraqshould do so to avoid the need for resort to otheractions. The response chosen by the Security Councilmust  however  take into account the need not toimpose further costs on ordinary Iraqi people innocentof any wrongdoing. The response should not involveactions that undermine  rather than strengthen  the waragainst terrorism.The United Nations has shown that collectiveaction can save lives and help rebuild nations. We willsoon welcome the world's newest nation  East Timor into the United Nations  and we should celebrate thesuccess of the United Nations peacekeeping missionand Transitional Administration in that country. Icongratulate Sergio Vieira de Mello  the Secretary-General's former Special Representative  on his role and I thank those countries that contributed so much to14giving hope and opportunity to the people of that smallcountry.New Zealand has had a battalion of peacekeepersdeployed in East Timor since September 1999  and alsohas peacekeepers serving in 12 other countries. We areproud that they have performed their role withprofessionalism and respect for the people in whosecountries they operate. Notwithstanding the small sizeof our population  New Zealand currently is thetwenty-second-largest contributor to the UnitedNations peacekeeping personnel.The promotion of human rights is another areawhere multilateral action by the internationalcommunity is essential. In the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights and in the International Covenant onCivil and Political Rights  the United Nations has setout universal standards for the observance of humanrights. There is no justification for any country todeviate from those human rights standards. It is a markof shame that States Members of this Organizationcontinue to breach basic human rights and a disgracethat other countries too often act as apologists for theoffending regimes.An important landmark in the last year has beenthe entry into force of the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. As the culmination oflongstanding efforts by non-governmentalorganizations  Governments and the internationalcommunity as a whole  it offers the prospect ofbringing justice to the victims of the most horrificcrimes known to humankind and bringing theirperpetrators to justice. It will serve as a deterrent wherenone has existed before. We have listened carefully tothose who argue that the Court is not necessary andthat it unduly jeopardizes their peacekeepers  but wecannot agree. The status quo  relying on domesticjurisdiction alone  has failed humankind throughouthistory and has borne witness to appalling crimes. Thenew regime has carefully built-in safeguards to protectthe innocent.We were dismayed by the actions of the SecurityCouncil in July. At that time  we challenged both thelegitimacy and the substance of the Council's action.We do not believe that it was consistent with the RomeStatute or that the Council is able to arrogate to itselfthe power to change treaty relationships.A further issue on which greater progress must bemade is that of disarmament. The fact that humanitysurvived the nightmare of potential nuclear destructionduring the cold war cannot be allowed to make uscomplacent about ongoing threats from weapons ofmass destruction.We welcome the Treaty of Moscow and theagreement between Russia and the United States to cutthe number of strategic nuclear weapons each countrydeploys. These reductions  however  are not asubstitute for irreversible cuts in  and the totalelimination of  those weapons.In some respects even greater danger is posed byshort-range tactical nuclear weapons. There is a realrisk that these could be launched by accident or inconfusion  with no time available for communicationbetween opposing sides.Over the last year  two significant events havemade our world a most dangerous place. The first is theemergence of international terrorist groups that haveshown their willingness to use weapons of massdestruction — biological  chemical or nuclear —should they gain access to them.The second is the situation in South Asia  wherethe world recently came close to direct conflictbetween two countries with nuclear capability. Theinternational community has not done enough to reducethose risks.The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty hasnot been brought into effect. Progress towards theimplementation of undertakings made by nuclear-weapon States at the Non-Proliferation Treaty ReviewConference has stalled. Nations have not takensufficient steps to stop the production of fissilematerial and to reduce stocks.In this and in many other areas much more needsto be done to address growing problems that affect allof us. The awful toll of HIV/AIDS  slowness inresponse to global warming and the growth in thesmuggling and trafficking of people are but threefurther examples.It is essential that we renew our commitment tomultilateralism as the best way to address globalproblems. That requires not simply money but  mustimportantly  political will. It is not a case of puttingglobal interests ahead of national interests. Global15interests are national interests. The United Nations isour most valuable international organization  but weneed to do more to enhance its relevance  value and itsunique authority. All of us are stakeholders in itssuccess."
"131",5403,"OMN",57,2002,"﻿It givesme great pleasure to offer  on behalf of the Governmentof the Sultanate of Oman  our warmest congratulationsto you  Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its current session. We assure you of ourfullest cooperation towards achieving the noble goalsand objectives to which we collectively aspire for thebenefit of mankind and the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.In this connection  we wish to express ourappreciation for the ongoing tireless efforts ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan on behalf ofinternational peace and security  the rule ofinternational law and the work of the Organization inthis regard. We also thank him for his annual report which details the achievements of the United Nations the obstacles ahead and its vision of the future embodying the conscience and aspirations of theinternational community.I also take this opportunity to welcome theaccession of the Swiss Federation and the DemocraticRepublic of Timor-Leste to membership of the UnitedNations. We are confident that their membership will22be an important asset in the promotion of the work ofthis Organization in achieving its noble goals ofinternational peace and security.Here in the renowned city of New York  we arecommemorating the terrorist attacks of 11 September2001. Once again  we would like to express our deepestsympathies and condolences to the families of thevictims of that senseless attack. We wish also toreaffirm our solidarity with the United States ofAmerica in fighting all forms of terror against innocentpeople everywhere.The Middle East is experiencing increasedtension due to a serious regression in the peace processon all tracks  particularly the Israeli-Palestinian track.The primary causes of this are the Israeli Government'sdeviation from the fair principles and foundationsestablished at the 1991 Madrid Conference  and thedesire of successive Israeli Governments since 1996 toimpose peace through excessive force. This runscounter to Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and338 (1973)  and to the formula of land for peace. Israelis pursuing a policy of procrastination and intimidationand is circumventing international instruments andagreements signed by the parties concerned. This hasresulted in a further escalation of Palestinianresistance  by all factions and in all forms  to Israelioccupation.My Government condemns all terrorist acts regardless of their motivation and deplores all acts ofviolence against innocent civilians  whether perpetratedby the Palestinian or the Israeli side. Events haveproven that the use of force against the Palestinianpeople will not lead to a fair solution  to an end toviolence or to security  as the Israeli Governmentclaims; nor will it end the legitimate Palestinianresistance against Israeli occupation. The end of suchresistance is contingent upon the end of Israelioccupation.All Arab States have affirmed that theachievement of a peace based on the principles ofinternational law and justice is our strategic choice  andwe have exerted great efforts to that end  the latestbeing the Arab peace initiative adopted unanimously atthe Beirut Summit held last March. This historicinitiative was widely welcomed by the internationalcommunity because it is in conformity withinternational legitimacy and principles  and incompliance with Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973)  which demand the withdrawalof Israel from the Arab territories occupied since June1967  including Al-Quds Al-Sharif  and the granting toPalestinian refugees of the right to return  in return forthe recognition of Israel by Arab States and thenormalization of relations with it.Security Council resolution 1397 (2002) sets outthe concept of establishing a recognized PalestinianState peacefully coexisting alongside the State ofIsrael. In that connection  my Government calls on theinternational community  especially Security Councilmembers  to shoulder their responsibility to ensure thatthe Israeli Government will respect and implementrelevant international resolutions and respond seriouslyto Arab and international efforts.My Government supports the just position takenby the Syrian Arab Republic with respect to regainingthe occupied Golan Heights and its request for Israeliwithdrawal to the line of 4 June 1967. In the same vein we support the position of the Republic of Lebanonwith regard to recovering the occupied Shab'a farmsarea and its demand that Israel fully implementSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978)  which calls forthe immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from allLebanese territory  including the Shab'a farms area.The overall humanitarian situation in Iraqremains tragic due to the ongoing economic sanctionsimposed on Iraq since August 1990. Consequently  myGovernment emphasizes the importance of a SecurityCouncil review of the international sanctions policyimposed on countries  a review that would lead toeasing the humanitarian harm that befalls peoples  andthat would take into consideration the status of atargeted Government's implementation of internationalresolutions.My Government reiterates its call upon theSecurity Council to put an end to the human sufferingin Iraq  and in that regard we call for the continuationof dialogue and discussions between Iraq and theUnited Nations with a view to Iraq fulfilling itsremaining international commitments. The SecurityCouncil needs to put in place a clear-cut and specificmechanism telling Iraq what it needs to do to end thetragic suffering and to arrive at a final and completelifting of the economic sanctions.We feel optimistic and pleased at theaccomplishments of the Arab Summit in Beirut especially in terms of its positive climate in creating a23spirit of understanding and rapprochement betweenIraq and Kuwait. In that connection  my Governmentwelcomes the Iraqi initiative to return the Kuwaitinational archives and urges the Iraqi Government topersist with the option of continuous and constructivedialogue and serious consultations to fulfil itsunfulfilled commitments under Security Councilresolutions  specifically relating to prisoners of warand missing Kuwaiti and third-country citizens. In thatregard  we urge the Iraqi Government to cooperate withthe Tripartite Commission and the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to deal with thishumanitarian issue.My Government is confident that the Iraqi filecannot be closed without continuous diplomatic effortsby all  through United Nations channels and in anyother political way available. We thus find nojustification for any military operation against Iraq. Wetherefore welcome the statement made by PresidentGeorge W. Bush of the United States at the outset ofthe general debate  in which he spoke of addressing theIraqi crisis through the Security Council.My Government follows with great interest andoptimism the official contacts maintained between theUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iranregarding the dispute on the three islands belonging tothe Emirates  Abu Musa  Greater Tunb and LesserTunb. We hope that these contacts and negotiations willlead to an agreement on an effective mechanism for thesettlement of this issue.My country  along with other countries in theregion  is interested in the establishment of securityand stability in the Indian subcontinent. In that regard we place high value on international efforts to containthe conflict between India and Pakistan  and we urgethose countries to benefit from international diplomacyto agree on an effective mechanism leading to apeaceful and final settlement of the Kashmir dispute.Regarding Afghanistan  we welcome the return ofthat country to the international family  and we lookforward to the establishment of security and stability inits territory under the supervision of a Governmentreflecting the aspirations of all parties in Afghanistan.My Government values international efforts to assistthe Afghan Government and the internationalcommunity's ongoing financial and technical assistancefor rebuilding the country and providing for the basicneeds of the Afghan people after so many years ofsuffering and war.My country condemns all forms of terrorism. Inline with the purposes of the United Nations in themaintenance of international peace and security  wereaffirm our support for international efforts to fightterrorism and our commitment to the relevantinternational resolutions  including Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001)  and all relevant Islamic  Araband international treaties and agreements to which mycountry has acceded. My delegation expresses itsreadiness to cooperate with the United Nations infighting international terrorism  in accordance with theprinciples of international law and the principle ofnational sovereignty  and taking into account the needto distinguish between terrorism and legitimateresistance against occupation. The Sultanate of Omansupports the call for the convening under UnitedNations auspices of an international conference onterrorism in order to agree on a clear internationaldefinition of terrorism and to set up a mechanism toaddress and eradicate terrorism.My country deeply believes that the accessionand commitment of States to treaties and conventionson disarmament will strengthen and preserve peace andsecurity on the regional and international levels.Consequently  the signature of the Sultanate of Omanremains on the record as a State party to such treaties.Based on that principle  we emphasize the need totake practical measures to make the Middle East aregion free from all weapons of mass destruction. Inthat connection  we request Israel to join all relevanttreaties  beginning with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  and to subjectits nuclear facilities to the safeguards inspection regimeof the International Atomic Energy Agency. Thatwould create a positive climate and put an end to armsproliferation in the region.My country calls on the United Nations tocontinue its broad-based efforts to rid the worldcompletely of all types of weapons of mass destruction.We urge nuclear-weapon States in particular toformulate time-bound programmes to achieve that goalas soon as possible. In that regard  my Governmentcommends the United States and the RussianFederation for having reached an agreement on thereduction of their nuclear arsenals.24My country is currently presiding over the GulfCooperation Council (GCC)  and hosted the twenty-second session of the Supreme Council of the GCC held in December 2001 in Muscat. That summitresulted in the adoption of many decisions andresolutions and other achievements  including thesigning of an economic agreement among memberStates and an agreement on a standardized customsduty of 5 per cent on all imported goods. Thatagreement will take effect when a customs unionamong member States comes into force at thebeginning of next year. The Council also took adecision on a unified Gulf currency. That will enhanceeconomic structures  facilitate differential trade andincrease the Gulf's competitiveness with other regionaleconomic groups  in addition to promoting the labourmarket and the private sector in our countries. It willalso attract more investors and commercialpartnerships within the great Arab region  with otherfriendly States  and in world markets.Among the prominent results of the Muscatsummit was our leaders' decision to invite the Republicof Yemen to join a number of Gulf jointestablishments. That decision was taken based on themutual desire and deep belief of both parties that theincorporation of Yemen into the GCC in a gradual andcalculated manner will conform to the economic andsocial needs and development circumstances of Yemenand will serve the common interests of the region.We are working to preserve the environment. Wehave a strong record of achievements and measurestaken by our Government to plan nationalenvironmental protection strategies. However  it is nosecret that many obstacles threaten our environmentinternally  regionally and internationally. Among thechallenges is the lack of sufficient water to cope withpopulation growth  which will endanger our populationand will increase the risk of desertification  making itnecessary that we intensify scientific research andallocate the resources necessary for that purpose.We are happy to have participated in theJohannesburg World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  and we wish to emphasize our interest inthe outcome documents adopted at the conference. Wealso take this opportunity to emphasize the need torespect United Nations resolutions and decisions aswell as the Charter."
"132",5449,"PAK",57,2002,"﻿I extend to you Mr. President  my felicitations on your election. I alsocongratulate your predecessor  Dr. Han Seung-soo  forhis able stewardship of the preceding session of theGeneral Assembly.We commend Secretary-General Kofi Annan forhis commitment and dedicated efforts in the pursuit ofthe Charter's purposes and principles. I alsocongratulate Switzerland and East Timor on theiradmission as members of the United Nations.Last year  this Assembly met under the shadow ofthe terrorist attacks on New York  our host city. Thehorror of that day galvanized the internationalcommunity to combat this modern day evil whichthreatens to destabilize our societies.Pakistan is in the forefront of the fight againstterrorism. We have made major sacrifices in this war.We have interdicted infiltration by Al-Qaida intoPakistan. We have arrested and deported foreignsuspects found on our territory. We are determined notto allow anyone to use our soil for terrorist acts insideor outside Pakistan.However  some quarters are unfortunatelyutilizing the war against terrorism as a vehicle tospread hatred against Islam and Muslims. Terrorismhas neither creed nor religion. In a globalized world religious and cultural diversity should be a vehicle forcomplementary creativity and dynamism  not therationale for a new ideological or politicalconfrontation. A sustained dialogue between theIslamic and Western nations is essential to remove theveil of ignorance and prejudice and to promoteharmony and cooperation. As a first step  may Ipropose that the General Assembly consider theadoption of a declaration on religious and culturalunderstanding  harmony and cooperation.There is a need to address the root causes ofterrorism. It is not religion which impels a terrorist act;it is often a sense of frustration and powerlessness toredress persistent injustices. When a people's right toself-determination and freedom are brutally suppressedby foreign occupation  they may be driven to put up15resistance by all means. Terrorist attacks must becondemned  but acts of terrorism by individuals orgroups cannot be the justification to outlaw the juststruggle of a people for self-determination andliberation from colonial or foreign occupation  nor canit justify state terrorism.Misusing the rationale of war against terrorism India has sought to delegitimize the Kashmiri freedomstruggle  tarnish Pakistan with the brush of terrorismand drive a wedge between Pakistan and its coalitionpartners. Boasting of its coercive capability  India hasdeployed about a million troops in battle formationagainst Pakistan. Such threatening and aggressiveposturing will not resolve disputes. We in Pakistancannot be coerced or frightened into compromising ourprincipled position on Kashmir.The conflict in occupied Kashmir is being wagedby the Kashmiris themselves. No amount of externalassistance could have inspired the Kashmiri people tosacrifice the lives of 80 000 of their youth and tosustain their struggle for decades against India'soccupation army.India's planned elections in Kashmir will onceagain be rigged. Such elections  under Indianoccupation  will not help peace. They may set it back in fact. The people of Jammu and Kashmir must beallowed to exercise their right to determine their ownfuture in accordance with the relevant resolutions ofthe Security Council.Despite India's provocations and threats over thepast year  Pakistan has acted with restraint andresponsibility. We have advanced several peaceproposals. They have all been spurned by India. Let medeclare from this rostrum: Pakistan will not start aconflict with India. But let me also declare that  if waris thrust upon us  we shall exercise our right to self-defence fully and very effectively.Today  peace in South Asia is hostage to oneaccident  one act of terrorism  one strategicmiscalculation by India. In this dangerous situation crisis management should not be allowed to become asubstitute for conflict resolution. The steps required toavoid a conflict and advance peace in South Asia areclear: first  mutual withdrawal of forward-deployedforces by both States; secondly  observance of aceasefire along the Line of Control in Kashmir; and finally  cessation of India's state terrorism against theKashmiri people. Simultaneously to all this  a dialoguemust be resumed between India and Pakistan. Thestructure for such a dialogue was agreed between PrimeMinister Vajpayee and myself at Agra. The Kashmirisshould be fully associated with the dialogue onKashmir and should be allowed to travel freely toPakistan and Azad Kashmir.To ensure sustainable peace and stability in SouthAsia  a Kashmir solution should be accompanied byagreed measures for nuclear restraint and aconventional arms balance between India and Pakistan.India's ongoing massive military build-up reflects itsknown desire for domination over South Asia and theIndian Ocean. In the interest of regional and globalstability  this must be discouraged.India's belligerence also reflects the chauvinisticideology of the Hindu extremist parties andorganizations. Rising Hindu fanaticism in India hastargeted Muslims  Christians  Sikhs and even thescheduled-caste Hindus. Last February  an estimated2 000 innocent Muslims were massacred and burnedalive in Gujarat with the complicity of the BharatiyaJanata Party's state leaders. There must beaccountability for this massacre. The internationalcommunity must act to oppose extremism in India withthe same determination it has displayed in combatingterrorism  religious bigotry  ethnic cleansing and fascisttendencies elsewhere in the world.Even as Hindu fundamentalism is rising in India Pakistan is waging a successful struggle to restore itstraditions of a tolerant Islam. We are acting vigorouslyto eradicate the sad legacy of the Afghanistan war:religious extremism  drugs and guns. We in Pakistanare determined to transform into reality the vision ofour founding father  the Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad AliJinnah  for a progressive  modern  democratic IslamicState. We wish to play a constructive role in promotingpeace and prosperity in South Asia  Central Asia andthe Gulf region.In three short years  my Government has laid thefoundations of sustainable development and sustainabledemocracy in Pakistan. We have empowered the peopleby devolving decision-making to the grass-roots level.We have improved human rights  virtually eliminatedexploitive child labour and empowered the women ofPakistan. We have rationalized economic policies and despite internal and external shocks  set Pakistan on thepath of sustained economic growth. Pakistan has alsobecome the first country to set up a human16development fund  with the collaboration of the UnitedNations Development Programme  and a nationalvolunteers corps for the achievement of the millenniumgoals of poverty alleviation and human development.In 30 days  we will hold national  provincial andSenate elections  completing the process of restoringtrue democracy in Pakistan.We in Pakistan remain extremely happy with thepositive changes in Afghanistan after two decades ofconflict. We fully support President Hamid Karzai. Weappreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General and hisSpecial Representative  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  to bringhope and peace to the long-suffering Afghan people.We believe that faithful implementation of the Bonnprocess and the Tokyo commitments is essential forsuccess. Ensuring credible security in Kabul and othercentres is of paramount importance. This was broughthome by the attempt made a few days ago toassassinate President Karzai.The international community must urgentlyrevive the Middle East peace process also to realize acomprehensive and just peace on the basis of SecurityCouncil resolutions and the principle of land for peace.Pakistan supports the full and faithfulimplementation of all Security Council resolutions.In our globalizing yet divided world  the mostimportant war we must fight is the war against poverty.The objectives of this war have been identified — atthe Millennium Summit  at Doha  Monterrey andJohannesburg. We must implement the commitmentsmade in an integrated and coherent manner.Let me state here that a pernicious aspect of theinternational banking system is the stashing away insecret accounts in developed countries of moneyacquired illegally by corrupt elite from developingcountries. An international regime to interdict andreturn illegally acquired wealth to the developingcountries will make a genuine contribution to thereduction of corruption and poverty alleviation in thosecountries.Despite current differences among Governments people from both rich and poor nations are beginningto embrace universal values and common goals:avoiding war; ending poverty  hunger  disease discrimination and human rights violations; promotingdemocracy; sharing technology; creating decent workfor all; and protecting the environment. We mustcapture this growing spirit of global humanism toadvance the quest for global prosperity and universalpeace. This can be accomplished only by the UnitedNations.Our decisions and actions today will shape eventsof the future. We must rid ourselves of forces ofintolerance and radicalism. We have to create a saferworld for our future generations — a world of peaceand conciliation  not one of conflict and tension."
"133",5492,"PAN",57,2002,"﻿Allow meto begin my statement by expressing the pleasure of theGovernment and people of Panama on your well-deserved election  Sir  as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. We fullysupported that election.We value your understanding of most of theissues that are the subjects of debate in this world arenaand the opportunities afforded us by the experience thatyou have gained in your homeland  along with that ingeneral of the peoples of Eastern Europe  a region that in recent years  has been the crucible of the mostcomplex problems and  at the same time  the mostinnovative solutions.I also pay tribute to the extraordinary work ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan  who has madeundeniable and productive efforts to achievereconciliation among peoples living in the midst ofconflict.I wish to express my satisfaction at having beenable to stand with the American people at thecommemoration of the first anniversary of the tragicevents of 11 September. Images of the moving and above all  authentic homage paid yesterday morningwill remain graven indelibly in my memory. If thenationalities of the heroes had been noted along withtheir names  we would undoubtedly have understoodmore clearly that this crime was an assault not only onthe United States of America  but on the whole ofhumankind.Terrorism has become the gravest threat tointernational security and to the environment of peacethat has gradually gained ground throughout the world.This has come at the price of an immense sacrifice in13terms both of human life and of resources that shouldbe devoted to promoting the collective well-being ofour societies.That is why terrorism must be defeated utterly using all means available to us  wherever it may befound. With such resolve  Panama has taken specificsteps  ratifying the major international instrumentsagainst terrorism and adopting and implementingdomestic legal norms designed to control the sources offinancing. In the context of this collective endeavour our country has chaired the Committee on HemisphericSecurity of the Organization of American States seeking thereby to adapt to our realities all instrumentsthat are relevant to this issue  while strengtheningmechanisms of cooperation in the fight againstterrorism.In the light of that commitment  on 7 March weratified the Rome Statute creating the InternationalCriminal Court and deposited our instruments ofratification with the United Nations on 21 March. Wefirmly believe that  as stipulated by the Statute  wemust end the impunity of those who commit appallingcrimes against humanity  regardless of the chargesbrought by the victims and of the immunities that mayhave been extended to the perpetrator within or outsidehis own country.However  the fight against terrorism and theabuse of power that hinders democracy and undermineshuman rights must go hand in hand with genuinegrowth opportunities for the developing countries.The Republic of Panama has unreservedlyassumed the commitment to broadly disseminate theBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action onwomen  as well as to implement the Platform's 12critical areas of concern.We also reaffirm that the progress of nations mustbe based on sustainable development  guided by thecommitments undertaken at Rio de Janeiro and therelevant processes culminating at Johannesburg  withall their agreements and initiatives.Our foreign policy is based on the fundamentalvalues of our people  such as the promotion ofdemocracy and good governance  solidarity andinternational cooperation. For that reason  we haveembraced the free trade option  but  as we indicated inMonterrey in March 2002  a more equitable economicregime must be consolidated that will enhanceopportunities for cooperation  address the question ofour external indebtedness and stimulate free tradebased on equity and symmetry.In that context  we currently host the interimsecretariat for the Free Trade Area of the Americas aspiring  as we have demonstrated  to become the siteof the permanent secretariat in 2005.Panama is moving firmly in the right direction addressing the far-reaching themes of the newmillennium with the active participation of society. It ismodernizing the State administration  tackling the needto modernize its educational and social securitysystems and developing its rural sector. At the sametime  we are beginning to forge a new industrialstrategy with tools that will give us access tointernational markets on a competitive footing in termsof price and quality.At the same time as the Panama Canal is beingrapidly modernized to respond to the demands of worldtrade  we are enhancing our democratic stabilitythrough increasingly efficient and transparentprocesses. We respect and support human rights particularly the freedom of expression  and we aretaking innovative steps to guarantee a promising futurefor our society.In the context of all of these initiatives  which arerepeated in country after country  the United Nations without doubt  will have to play a much moreaggressive role  sustaining and enhancing capacities forpolitical dialogue and preventing the economic domainfrom assuming that role. For that reason  thisrevitalizing effort must be supplemented with sustainedaction  as has been recommended by the Group ofLatin American and Caribbean States and otherregional groups.Panama hails the way the Security Council hasconducted its work over the past year and continues tobelieve that this important United Nations organ becomposed of a larger number of members. However  aswe did at the fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly  we stress today that consideration ofpermanent or non-permanent status must be linked tojustifications in keeping with the new vision of theworld and that changes must not be introduced thatcould lead to the permanent distribution of privilegesthat became manifestly obsolete years ago.14Like the rest of the world  we are concerned atthe situation in the Middle East  in neighbouringColombia and in many other parts of the world whereinternational support is still being anxiously awaited.Our Government believes that the benefits of theUnited Nations system and its various bodies must beextended to the people of Taiwan  while fostering abroad debate with the aim of beginning formal peaceful negotiations that will lead the people of Chinato resolve existing differences.Our delegation is particularly gratified at thepresence of so many political leaders who have comehere in a gesture of fraternal solidarity with all thecitizens of the world who were victims of the madnessand the evil of groups that do not understand theadvantages of dialogue and civilized understanding.We will only be able achieve the lofty goals weare setting at this forum through the unity of those whoaspire to live in a fraternal  prosperous and peacefulworld. May God enlighten us and guide us in thesearch for that legitimate aspiration."
"134",5539,"PER",57,2002,"﻿Mr. President  may I first of all congratulate you onyour election to an office of high responsibility in theUnited Nations. The best wishes of the Peruvian peopleand their Government go also to the delegationsgathered here for an event that coincides with our12commemoration of the sad moments that one year agoput to the test the feelings and solidarity of humankind.Human beings cannot and must not  either asindividuals or as a species  cease their efforts to makehistory rational. Because it is that effort to give a senseof freedom and justice to collective living that alonecan humanize life.As President of Peru I reaffirm from this rostrumthe commitment of the Government and the people ofPeru to the international community to fight resolutelyin favour of democracy and international security which my country considers fundamental to humandevelopment.The world has put an enormous challenge beforeus  the challenge of globalizing security. Without thatsecurity our economies cannot grow and our nationscannot develop socially  for it is clear that globalinsecurity conspires against the poor.For that same reason  and driven by ourdemocratic convictions  I wish to reaffirm here without ambiguity  my firm condemnation of theinsanity of the terrorist attacks perpetrated against thepeople of the United States on 11 September 2001  andto reaffirm the solidarity of the Peruvian people andGovernment to our friend the United States ofAmerica. My Government will continue to support theinternational community's efforts to confront  alwayswithin the framework of international law  the crueland irrational ravages of international terrorism.In that regard  Peru pledges before this Assemblyto continue to cooperate with the Security Council'sCounter-Terrorism Committee by making available theexperts it needs in order to counter with intelligenceand resolve the threats and acts of internationalterrorism  consistent with the principles of the Charterof the United Nations and Security Council resolutions.We are convinced that our nations must weave avast network of commitments if we are to cooperateeffectively in all fields in order to defeat terrorism.Peace  democracy and human rights  along withfreedom of expression  are the concepts that must begiven priority in the process of globalization. And tothat end  Peru supports every effort to reach aconsensus in the negotiation of a draft comprehensiveconvention against terrorism.Peru is a party to 12 United Nations conventionswhich relate to the fight against terrorism and  in thatregard  we call upon those States that have not yet doneso to sign and ratify these conventions. I refer inparticular to the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism and theInternational Convention for the Suppression ofTerrorist Bombings. That would be a decisive steptowards the eradication of this scourge  which threatenspeace  security and democracy  creating instability andjeopardizing the development of our peoples.We make this appeal from the perspective of acountry that lived for more than 20 years with theviolence of terrorism  which took more than 20 000lives and cost billions of dollars in material losses.Peace is not just a beautiful sentiment; it is theprincipal value shared by peoples and a prerequisite forthe development of our nations. On the basis of thatconviction  our Government is promoting  as one of themain pillars of its foreign policy  a limit on militaryexpenditure at the regional level  with a view to freeingup resources for social investment and to combatingwant and abject poverty.My country's commitment goes beyond merewords. In 2002  consistent with our proposals  we havetaken the decision to reduce our military expenditureby 20 per cent and to redirect the resources to health nutrition and education. I am pleased to be able to saythat we have made progress in this respect  and we aregratified by our recent achievements in this area withour fraternal country Chile.Today more than ever  Peru would like toreaffirm  before the international community  that is itcommitted to the building of a participatory andefficient system of collective security. To this end  weare promoting the adoption of the Andean Charter forPeace and Security  which was approved in June by theministers of foreign affairs and defence of the AndeanCommunity. Its resolute goal is to begin to formulate acommunity policy of security and confidence-building establish an Andean zone of peace  improve andexpand confidence-building measures and thus reducethe resources that are currently allocated to defence.Peru is pleased to announce that  in compliancewith its commitments under the Ottawa Convention  ithas completed the process of destroying its arsenals ofanti-personnel mines. It is currently conducting itslargest demining operation to date  to reduce mines inborder regions  as part of an agreement signed in 1998with the fraternal country Ecuador.13In the same context  our Government reaffirmsand renews its commitment to the creation of a SouthAmerican peace and cooperation zone  as declared inGuayaquil  Ecuador  on 27 July  during a meeting ofSouth American heads of State or Government. Wepropose the inclusion in the agenda of the GeneralAssembly of an item on the South American peace andcooperation zone and will encourage the adoption of adraft resolution in that regard.With regard of the promotion of democracy  Peruis today endeavouring fully to re-establish thefreedoms of its citizenry  strengthen its democraticinstitutions and resolutely fight against corruption. OurGovernment has begun this task with full respect fordemocratic values  as well as for the independence ofthe branches of State power. I would also like toemphasize the efforts that we have been making toconsolidate our democracy through mechanisms ofcoordination and political and social dialogue.In July  my Government  the political parties  thebusiness sector  workers  churches and other civilsociety organizations signed a national accord thatcontains 29 long-term State policies to be implementedby the current and future Governments over the next 20years. This accord has characteristics that are unique inthe history of Peru  since for the first time variouspolitical institutions and representatives of civil societymet and together committed themselves to continuity inState policies in the areas of democracy  equality social justice  competitiveness and transparency inpolitical affairs.Likewise  I would like to emphasize the signing at Peru's initiative  of the Inter-American DemocraticCharter  adopted by the Organization of AmericanStates on 11 September 2001. The Charter is aneffective means of making the principles  norms andmechanisms of collective action consistent throughoutthe region. That system includes sanctions  to beapplied in cases of violations or breaches of democraticinstitutions  with a view to promoting  preserving anddefending democracy in the Latin America.In the framework of the United Nations  we alsoencouraged the adoption by the Commission on HumanRights of a draft resolution entitled “Further measuresto promote and consolidate democracy”  which set out for the first time within the United Nations system  aset of criteria to determine whether or not a regime isdemocratic. It includes so-called democratic clausesand legitimizes collective action for the protection anddefence of democracy.From another perspective  and bearing in mindthe objective of peace  the Government of Perubelieves that building peace and good governance is avital prerequisite for the preservation of liberty and theattainment of mutual and more equitable development.In that regard  Peru is aware of the urgent needfor multilateral efforts — particularly by the richestcountries — to strengthen democracy. That is why wereiterate our proposal to create a mechanism offinancial solidarity for the defence of democracy andgood governance.The time has come to be creative — to create amechanism for the financing of good governance anddemocracy among our peoples. We have said thatdemocracy is costly. But democracy is a value thattranscends the vote  the ballot box and the institutionsof the State. It is founded on the deepest aspirations ofthe majority of our peoples  who are seeking their owndevelopment.For that same reason  emerging democracies which are today plagued by instability and uncertainty urgently require new resources to facilitate publicinvestment in the economies of the region aimed at re-energizing them  generating employment andprotecting them from adverse financial shock. We areat a crossroads of Wall Street and Main Street  wherewe must resolve the problems of our economies and yetlisten to the voices of our peoples demanding that theirjust aspirations be met. Our proposal  which we aretaking from door to door  forum to forum  and soul tosoul  is based on the conviction that Peruviandemocracy is not an island in Latin America and theworld  and cannot therefore be evaluated in isolationfrom global realities. We must insert Peru and LatinAmerica in an interconnected world. We state this withthe firm conviction that what is at stake is more thanPeru's democracy but rather the democracy of a systemthat has proven to be the best.My government  as I announced on the day whenI took office  wishes to be remembered in history asone that  with full respect for democracy and all thefundamental freedoms of men and women strengthened the development of Peru throughproductive and dignified work and through the courageto invest more in better nutrition  health and education.For this will be the best way to overcome the poverty14of nations. We are committed to facing the greatproblems and challenges of our time by buildingdemocracy in a world that is more just and has greatersolidarity.Today  at the beginning of the twenty-firstcentury  international democracy has a name: theUnited Nations. If the United Nations is weak  then itmust be strengthened; if it is slow  it must be given themeans to act with greater effectiveness and speed. Butwe cannot do without the framework of the UnitedNations.Peru is firmly committed to policies and valuesthat support sustainable development. I am pleased inthis regard to announce that today I shall be depositingwith the Secretary-General the instrument throughwhich Peru reaffirms the Kyoto Protocol. I call uponall other members of the international community thathave not yet done so to ratify that internationalinstrument in order to stem and reduce gas emissionsthat harm our nations. This also relates to thephenomenon of El Niño  which has been afflicting Peruand the countries of the Pacific with increasingfrequency and intensity.I wish to reiterate the firm commitment of Peru first of all  to cooperate with all States in theinternational fight against terrorism; secondly  to workfor peace and development  maintaining our proposalto limit military expenditures in South America andinstead to dedicate those resources to the fight againstpoverty; and thirdly  to strengthen international supportfor democracy and good governance as an importantstep in the battle that we are waging against povertyand extreme poverty in our nations."
"135",5586,"PHL",57,2002,"﻿As we welcome ournewest members  Switzerland and East Timor  wereaffirm our faith in the United Nations and in theprinciples of the Charter.Today  the United Nations faces more challengesand must respond to far more demands than were evercontemplated by its founders. Yet the Organizationremains the single most important universal and viableforum for States to interact  for nations to worktogether and for countries to cooperate in preservingpeace  in avoiding conflict and in promoting stability.We believe that Iraq took a step in the rightdirection when it agreed yesterday to the unconditionalreturn of United Nations weapons inspectors. But theimmediate challenge facing the Organization and ourworld is the looming confrontation that could bebrought about by the need for Iraq to comply  totallyand unconditionally  with the relevant Security Councilresolutions. We credit the diplomatic skills and thesheer determination of Secretary-General Kofi Annanand of the members of the Arab League with thiswelcome development. We will  therefore  await clearproof of sincerity in action.But this is just a beginning. We believe that weare far from a true resolution of this issue. We mustremain vigilant and must continue to have faith in theSecurity Council. The Philippines has full confidencein the Council process. We believe that the Councilwill act in accordance with the imperatives of worldpeace and security and that it will find the mostexpeditious and effective way to serve thoseimperatives.Consistent with its national interest  and inaccordance with its Constitution  the Philippines isprepared to extend political  security and humanitarianassistance to the United States and to the internationalcommunity in the pursuit of their most vital interest which coincides with our own vital interests: to defeatterrorism. The case for compliance is compelling. Thecharges are highly credible and have seriousimplications for global security. The Security Councilshould give those charges the most urgent andprofound consideration. The international communityhas put the onus on Iraq to comply with the relevantCouncil resolutions  especially with regard to theelimination of weapons of mass destruction.Yet we certainly live in a world of consequencesthat can be avoided. Poverty  intolerance and inequalityprovide the breeding ground for terrorism. But we neednot make terrorism an unavoidable consequence ofthose factors. We have learned that in the one yearsince the shocking and tragic events of 11 September.In that short span of time  we have learned thatterrorism cannot defeat us and that it cannot overcomeour resolve to fight it  and we have learned the full13measure of the bravery of the men and women whostand on the front lines in the war against terror. In thatshort span of time  we have established new strategicpartnerships and have retooled and rearmed existingstrategic partnerships. Those partnerships are based onthe belief that the world will never be secure unlessterrorist lairs are exposed and destroyed and unlessterrorist supporters are brought to justice.In the realm of what is just and what is fair  weknow that globalization can contribute to thecomprehensive and sustainable development of thedeveloping world. Indeed  in some cases it has done so.But the gap between the rich and poor countriescontinues to widen.Let us again remind ourselves of the stark realitythat 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day; 1.1billion people lack access to safe and affordabledrinking water; and 130 million school-age children the majority of whom are girls  lack the means to stayin school.The uneven spread of opportunities for thecreation of wealth  and the increasing incomeinequality within and between countries  have pushedlarger numbers of people to the margins of existence.We in the Philippines are building an openeconomy. We are taking concrete measures to create anopen trade and investment environment in our owncountry and in our region. We have adapted to therealities of globalization  fully aware of theconcomitant risks  particularly those that impinge onthe well-being of our vulnerable and disadvantagedgroups.We firmly believe that  in general  developingcountries accept the need for good governance in theirpublic and corporate sectors. We are continuing ourinstitutional reform  guided by our national priorities requirements and capabilities. We are taking greatpains to restructure our economy  often at high politicalcost.Capital is what developing countries lack most intheir pursuit of sustainable development. The Food andAgriculture Organization has estimated that anadditional annual public investment of $24 billion mustbe made in poor countries in order to halve the numberof hungry people by the United Nations millenniumtarget date of 2015.Developing countries need more foreign directinvestment  particularly in areas that will promote thesustainable use of the environment and sustainedgrowth. We also need improved access to foreignmarkets.Many developing countries must also effectivelycompete in areas where their comparative advantage isgreat  such as agriculture. However  developingcountries do not have the resources to match thesubsidies that agricultural producers receive in richcountries  such as the 40 billion euros that EuropeanUnion farmers receive each year or the additional $170billion that United States farmers will receive over thenext 10 years. We can only wonder what the liberatingimpact would be on development if the subsidies of 23cents per dollar for farm goods in the United States orthe 36 cents per dollar on farm goods in the EuropeanUnion were instead invested in developing countries.We need to reverse the decline in officialdevelopment assistance  which remains below thetarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product. But weshould also not lose sight of the fact that  aside fromincreased funding sources for developing countries  theflip side of the development coin should be greaterrestraint  care and flexibility in the use ofconditionalities. Enhanced and effective debt relief including for middle-income countries  is also needed.Efforts to reform the international financialarchitecture and to strengthen the developmentdimension of the global trade and investment regimeshould be sustained.Globalization has provided more opportunitiesand greater choices for people who want to travel theworld in search of a livelihood. Some 10 per cent of thepeople of the Philippines are outside its border. Theirsafety and welfare is of paramount importance to us particularly in times of actual or potential conflict. Thewelfare of migrant workers should be placed higher onthe United Nations agenda now  before the migrantissue turns into a serious humanitarian problem. Wecan start by becoming States parties to the UnitedNations Convention on the Protection of the Rights ofAll Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.It is also important for developed nations to support theimportant work of humanitarian assistance agencieslike the International Organization for Migration.Despite the unprecedented wealth created in thelast decade of the twentieth century  one out of every14five people lives on less than $1 a day. The 32 poorestAfrican countries do not earn much more than therichest man on earth  the title unofficially bestowedupon Bill Gates  the Chairman of Microsoft  in theUnited States. Despite the grinding poverty in whichbillions of people live  the world spends incrediblesums for military purposes  for armies and weaponsof mass annihilation.Those bent on fomenting hate and violence willfind willing adherents  particularly among the helpless and hopeless poor  the dispossessed and thedisenfranchised. The hungry  the young people who donot go to school and those living in the margins ofsociety can become easy prey to the siren songs ofterrorists and the perpetrators of violence. Povertyalleviation and development are therefore keystrategies in preventing conflict and fighting terrorism.Terrorism has become a major cause of violenceand instability in our world. But this is not the onlymenace to our collective security. Organized crime environmental degradation and contagious diseasescontinue to threaten international peace and security.The proliferation of conventional and non-conventionalweapons  including small arms  is continuing. Civilwars and inter-State conflicts remain major causes ofinstability and underdevelopment. The United Nationsmust therefore continue to play its importantpeacekeeping and peacemaking role.Durable peace and progress with freedom can beachieved only through international partnerships and arenewed faith in the United Nations  which shouldguarantee meaningful participation by developingcountries in global decision-making. The challenges ofthe world today  potential and actual conflict terrorism  violence  environmental degradation organized crime and contagious diseases  recognizeno boundaries and affect all.In the eloquent language of the PhiladelphiaDeclaration of the International Labour Organization poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperityeverywhere'. That is the case because humanity  andhuman destiny  has become a seamless whole. Noman is an island  and the bell tolls for us  too. This isthe timeless vision of the United Nations  validated byall who have spoken here at the fifty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly. It is a vision and a bond thatshould unite all nations as we face new dangers and theunmarked frontiers of our collective life on this small endangered planet. Indeed  the United Nationscontinues to be the last best hope of mankind."
"136",5605,"PLW",57,2002,"﻿At the outset  I wish tocongratulate Mr. Kavan on his successful election tothe leadership post of this Assembly and to offer mycountry's welcome to East Timor and Switzerlandfollowing their recent admission into our family ofnations.We gather here slightly more than one year afterthe appalling  unconscionable events of 11 September2001. The world is still striving to come to grips withthe full implications of the inhumane savagery of theattacks here in New York and in Alexandria  Virginia.Given the great number of areas in which the variousMembers of this Organization have differing and oftencompeting interests  we can all derive hope and pridefrom the fact that the solidarity so evident in theGeneral Assembly last year is still largely intact today.Governments around the world continue to cooperatein efforts to identify  locate and shut down terroristorganizations and those who would give comfort andaid to such organizations.Palau  in spite of the inherent limitations imposedby its size  remoteness  capacity constraints andeconomic vulnerability  has fully committed itself toworking with the community of nations to defeatterrorists and their sympathizers. We have aggressivelypursued revisions in our laws which make it easier togather information on suspicious persons and activities to share information with other jurisdictions  to blocksuspect financial transactions  to establish domesticcriminal penalties for transnational crimes  tospecifically recognize acts of terror as crimes under ourdomestic legal system  and to streamline ourprocedures for asset seizure and extradition in order tobetter cooperate with our comrades in this war onterrorism.However  the limitations to which I have referredare hampering our efforts to fully implement these2laws. No matter how much we may wish to support theglobal war on terrorism  Palau  like many otherdeveloping nations  will not be able to participatemeaningfully in this vital campaign without theassistance of the developed nations. Therefore  to thoseleading the combat against terrorism  Palau says:“Please  give us the tools we need to make a substantialcontribution to this fight and render practical supportfor your efforts.”While the great majority of nations remain unitedin their desire to see terrorism defeated — and that is acause for hope — there are also grounds for concern.Some nations appear to be wavering in their resolve totake concrete actions to prevent terrorist attacks  whilesome others seem not to fully appreciate the newdynamic of the post-11 September world. Those whosupported or condone the events of 11 September takeheart when they hear members of this body speak ofwaiting for a consensus before acting to removecredible threats to national and international stability.Terrorists and their sympathizers are likewisecomforted when they hear leaders continue to talk inthe old language of how to react to terrorism  ratherthan speak of how to prevent and pre-empt the nextattack. Nothing pleases the forces of global terror morethan hearing members of the world coalition againstterrorism speak of measured and agreed-uponresponses to the next atrocity.The bottom line is this: The potential forcatastrophic harm is so great that we cannot wait forthe next attack. In this regard  Palau fully supports theUnited States in its resolve to pre-empt further attacksand loss of life. The very laudable ideal of multilateral consensus-driven action is good  but it cannot justifyand will not excuse the loss of human lives and thedegradation of human life that will result from givingthose who rely on or sponsor terror the opportunity tostrike first  either directly or by proxy. Palau thereforecalls upon the Members of the United Nations onceagain to come together in their commitment to forestallfuture tragedies.As noted earlier  we can derive some satisfactionfrom the fact that the goodwill and unity of purposethat prevailed immediately after last year's subhumanattacks in large part continue to exist. However  Palaualso notes that the recent World Summit on SustainableDevelopment revealed a dismal lack of commitment toaddressing the development needs of the great majorityof nations. The failure of key nations to recommit tothe goals of the Rio Earth Summit is equallydisappointing. Taken together  those developmentsdemonstrate that such goodwill and solidarityapparently are confined to matters that most concernthe developed world.The lack of progress on sustainable developmentalso strongly suggests that the developed world stillsees developing nations such as Palau as mere tokenmembers of the international community  rather than asviable partners. The current view the developed nationsseem to have of the developing world is unacceptableand can lead only to greater unrest and instability in thefuture.It is time for the unity of purpose thatcharacterizes the global war on terror to be brought tobear in an equally global campaign for sustainabledevelopment. It is time to take affirmative action tocounteract the effects of globalization and correct thetechnological imbalances that are widening the gapbetween developed and developing nations. It is time totake concrete action to give developing nations thetools they need to manage and speed up their owndevelopment in ways that will lead to the replacementof dependence on foreign aid with dependence ondomestic industry. It is time to implement measures toend the marginalization of developing countries in thenew global economy. In that regard  Palau welcomesand applauds the Koizumi Initiative as one of the sadlyfew positive outcomes of the World Summit onSustainable Development and calls upon all developedmembers of the United Nations to develop similarinitiatives.The position of certain members of this body onfundamental environmental issues also suggests thatglobal solidarity is limited to areas that concern themajor Powers of the developed world. United NationsMembers that have enjoyed and continue to enjoy thehighest standard of living have done so and continue todo so at the expense of the environmental integrity ofour planet. Those major emitters are threatening thelives of small island States such as Palau  placing theirmere comfort above our very existence. At the sametime  they seek our support for their goals andinitiatives. That  too  is unacceptable.Fortunately  most of the developed world including the governments of the major industrializedeconomies of Japan and the European Union  hasrecognized its responsibility and has endorsed the only3viable response to the existing and worsening adverseimpact of climate change  the Kyoto Protocol  and theno-regrets philosophy it embodies. It is time for thosedeveloped nations which have shirked theirresponsibilities and shunned the Kyoto Protocol to endtheir callous disregard for the fate of those nationsmost vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climatechange  to admit that the Kyoto Protocol remains theonly meaningful first step towards comprehensivelyaddressing climate change and to join the great body ofnations that have pledged to work together through theKyoto Protocol and beyond to combat the effects ofclimate change.It is time to take the lessons we have learned fromthe war on terror  lessons regarding the fundamentalimportance of working together to respond to acommon threat  lessons regarding the very realinterdependence of all nations and lessons regardingthe need for  and ability of  nations to balance genuineglobal concerns against perceived self-interests andapply them to the threats posed by climate change andsea-level rise.Throughout my remarks today  I have emphasizedPalau's strong support — in some cases  demands —for global action to address the major threats tostability and progress in this new global order. That isbecause it has become apparent  as never before  thatthe widest possible participation in responding to thosethreats must be encouraged  if real and lasting solutionsare to be found.In light of that fact  Palau must once again notethe folly of excluding any potential partner from theefforts of the United Nations to meet the challenges wenow face and to prepare against the challenges tocome. Such exclusion is particularly short-sighted inefforts of the international community that go beyondpolitics and address fundamental human concerns  suchas health and education. For that reason  Palau mustagain call upon the members of the United Nations towelcome the Republic of China — Taiwan — into thisOrganization. At the very least  the membership at thisbody should endorse the participation of the Republicof China  Taiwan  in the World Health Organization the United Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme and similar bodies dedicated to improvingthe human condition. Mere politics should not beallowed to compromise or prevent the development ofa truly global effort to alleviate human suffering andbetter mankind.In the area of health  I have appeared before thisbody in the past  where I discussed the ill effects oftobacco use and our responsibility to protect our youthfrom the threat of tobacco addiction. I appear beforethe Assembly today to ask again for its completesupport for the Framework Convention on TobaccoControl  in order to combat tobacco-related illnessesand complications.Throughout these remarks  I have also repeatedlyreturned to the idea of security. That is primarilybecause we feel less secure in the aftermath of themonstrous attacks of 11 September 2001. The very ideaof security has taken on new meaning. Our collectiveunderstanding of the kind of cooperation andintegration that is necessary to provide effectivesecurity has changed radically. Yet  one of the foremostbodies for dealing with security  the Security Council has remained unchanged. That can hardly be right. Inthis new environment  it is time to re-examine thecomposition and powers of the Security Council  toconsider how it may be made both more accessible andmore accountable and to find ways to increase itsability to respond in a prompt  flexible and effectivemanner to the threats to peace that are sure to arise inthe future.In closing  let me again confirm Palau'sdedication to  and determination to take part in  theglobal efforts to meet the challenges facing us all.Palau will continue to do all it can to support universalresponses to threats to peace and stability  especiallymid- and long-term threats  such as climate change andsea-level rise and the widening gaps betweendeveloped and developing nations. On behalf of thepeople and Government of the Republic of Palau  I callupon all Members of this great Organization to dolikewise."

I also wish to place on record myGovernment's deep appreciation to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for hiscontinuing strong leadership and immense diplomaticskill in dealing with many pressing international issueswhich confront us today.Papua New Guinea welcomes and congratulatesthe newest State Member of the United Nations Switzerland  and looks forward to the accession tomembership of the Democratic Republic of East Timor.Papua New Guinea acknowledges the politicalwill and wisdom shown by all parties — the Republicof Indonesia  Australia  Portugal and the UnitedNations — in respect of East Timor. We also praise thepeople of Switzerland for their collective decision toformally join the United Nations.With the election of a new Government in mycountry  our Prime Minister  The Right Honourable SirMichael Somare  recently made a nationwide addressdetailing some of the challenges facing our economyand what is required to put it back on the path torecovery. He identified specific areas and sectors whereremedial measures are needed.Domestically  our capacity to meet thesechallenges and worthy goals is lacking. The problem isfurther exacerbated and our capacity furtherundermined by poor governance  incompetenteconomic management  a rise in corruption  anddiminished public confidence in political leadershipand in the fundamentals of representative government.The new Government of Papua New Guinea isdetermined to chart a new course by addressing theseproblems.There have been specific initiatives taken toenhance trade  investment and economic prospects. ThePacific countries members of the African  Caribbeanand Pacific Island Group of States (ACP)  togetherwith the African and Caribbean member States  arenow in the process of pursuing negotiations with theEuropean Union for possible economic partnershipagreements.Recently  I announced the direction of ourGovernment's foreign policy focus. I stated that the27policy must be underpinned by the development andstrengthening of core relations in the Asia-Pacificregion.We intend to consolidate relations with our closeneighbours and give more emphasis to the promotionof trade and economic cooperation  investment  andeducation and training.As a small island developing country  and as anaffected member of the global village  my country fullyendorses the declarations and plans of action adopted atrecent world conferences. We believe that internationalconferences such as the Doha  Monterrey andJohannesburg summits and their plans of action areblueprints to resolve many of the pressing globalchallenges and needs  including poverty eradication;sustainable development; environmental degradationand climatic changes; and social ills  including HIV/AIDS and other preventable diseases. They also echothe voices of the majority of the world's populationliving in poverty and struggling to overcome thebiggest challenge of all — how to survive.These declarations and plans of action are afurther amplification of the historic MillenniumDeclaration and its Development Goals  signed by allour heads of State and Government in September 2000.The challenge is to forge new global partnershipsfor change — partnerships in which both developedand developing countries join together to address theissues that the global community will face in this newmillennium. These partnerships also includeinternational financial institutions  intergovernmentalorganizations  the private sector  non-governmentalorganizations  and civil society.These partnerships will be necessary if the sharedhopes of humanity for peace and security  sustainabledevelopment and a better way of life for all are to berealized.Papua New Guinea has been faced with aninternal conflict in our province of Bougainville for thelast decade. Like all previous Governments  the currentGovernment will continue to address the continuingpeaceful resolution of this conflict as a matter ofpriority.Papua New Guinea would like to take thisopportunity to express its appreciation to the UnitedNations for its role in resolving this crisis. The conflicthas  in fact  involved substantial commitments ofpersonnel and funds by the United Nations neighbouring countries and Governments  includingour own.I would like also to place on record ourappreciation to the Governments of Australia  NewZealand  Fiji and Vanuatu for contributing financialand manpower resources to the Regional PeaceMonitoring Group to restore peace and security to theisland.In addition  on the recommendations of theSecretary-General  and in close cooperation betweenthe Papua New Guinea Government and theBougainville parties  the Security Council approved theexpansion of the role of the United Nations PoliticalOffice in Bougainville in monitoring and assisting inthe arms collection  storage and disposal  under thenew Bougainville Agreement.I am happy to report that the first and secondstages of the arms disposal programme are progressingwell; however  more remains to be done.Our partners from Australia  New Zealand  theEuropean Union  Japan  and the United NationsDevelopment Programme continue to provide resourcesfor restoration and development work. A number ofnon-governmental organizations  including churchesand the Red Cross  have also been active.Changing the world from a system of relationsbetween imperial Powers to a partnership betweensovereign States through decolonization is among thegreatest achievements of the United Nations in the lastcentury. The process will not be completed  as it mustbe  until the remaining 16 Non-Self-GoverningTerritories have exercised their inalienable right to self-determination.Our Organization should continue to monitordevelopments in New Caledonia  Tokelau and the other14 Non Self-Governing Territories on the UnitedNations decolonization list  on a case-by-case basis.Neither small size nor remoteness nor populationdensity should be allowed to qualify or limit theexercise of this inalienable right. The Pacific IslandsForum Leaders' Meeting  held last month in Fiji  onceagain reaffirmed its support for this principle.The Pacific Islands Forum Group  with theexception of Australia and New Zealand  comprises ofsmall island countries that are custodians of the largestocean space. This ocean is rich in natural marine28resources. The countries of the region  however  havelimited human  financial and technological capacitiesto control  manage  and secure those resources for thebenefit of our current and future generations.The recent Pacific Islands Forum adopted thePacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy  which aims toensure the future sustainable use of our oceans andtheir resources by our island communities and externalpartners.The Pacific Islands peoples have not receivedtheir equitable share of the benefits resulting from thetapping of natural resources within their vast oceanspace. For example  statistics showed that  in the year2000  the value of fishery in the Central and WesternPacific was in excess of $2.5 billion per annum  but thePacific countries earned a meagre $66 million inlicensing fees. This situation needs to be reviewed andchanged.More than 80 per cent of Papua New Guineanslive in rural villages  where they depend directly on theland  rivers  lakes and sea for their livelihood.Our National Constitution commits the nation toconserve  use  and develop the rich variety of thecountry's natural resources for the common good andbenefit of future generations. Papua New Guinea hastherefore spoken out strongly and worked actively on awide range of environmental issues.Like other members of the Pacific Islands Forum Papua New Guinea is firmly committed to theBarbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. Westrongly urge its full implementation.Papua New Guinea  together with other smallisland developing States  continues to reiterate deepconcerns about the adverse impacts of climate change climate variability and sea-level rise  particularly withregard to the small  low-lying islands that are alreadyexperiencing extreme hardships. We will thereforecontinue to stress the urgent need for the developedcountries to take a strong lead in the reductions ofgreenhouse gas emissions.Consistent with this  Papua New Guinea hassigned and ratified both the United Nations ClimateChange Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. Webelieve that the Kyoto Protocol paves the way forwardfor Annex I countries to fulfil their commitments underthe Climate Change Convention. We urge those partiesto translate their legally binding targets into concreteactions for the reduction of their gas emissions.We welcome the support for the Kyoto Protocolby Japan  the European Union and  more recently China and Russia. We urge the United States andAustralia to join the global efforts towards addressingthis issue  including ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.Pacific Forum island leaders also reiteratedcontinuing serious concerns over the shipment ofradioactive materials through the region. They calledon those States engaging in these activities to acceptfull responsibility and liability for compensation forany damage that may result  directly or indirectly  fromthe transport of radioactive material through the region.Global warming has brought an increase in thenumber of cases of diseases like malaria in the higher-altitude regions of our country. This is still a majorthreat to Papua New Guinea  particularly in the mostpopulous region — the highlands.Papua New Guinea is not immune to the HIV/AIDS epidemic  and tuberculosis is again on the rise so there is an urgent need to find preventative measuresfor these diseases.In this regard  we welcome announcements by theGovernments of Japan and the United States  amongother  that they would set aside substantial financialresources for eradication programmes in developingcountries. Papua New Guinea concurs with the recentcalls by the international community to reform andrestructure the charters and mandates of the twoBretton Woods institutions: the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund. These two institutionsmust realign their policies and focus more ondevelopment and poverty eradication  rather than onthe reconstruction of economies.Their lending policies should be made morelenient and flexible in assisting the developingcountries  including small islands  landlocked and theleast developed countries. The ultimate goal must be totransfer resources into the hands of the needy  themarginalized and the ostracized of society  so that theycan take pride in the ownership of the outcomes of newinitiatives taken in their own countries.The way forward was agreed to under theBarbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island States and Agenda 21and in the recent conferences on landlocked developing29countries and the Third United Nations Conference onthe Least Developed Countries in Brussels.I must however underline that to date  we haveobserved a lack of effective implementation of both theBarbados Programme of Action and Agenda 21. Therehas also been little or no increase in the internationalaid and development assistance given to the developingcountries to build necessary infrastructure  humanresource capacities  and other basic needs. This  in ourhumble view  has to change if the developing countries especially the small island developing States landlocked and the least developed countries are toattain sustainable growth and development.There is an urgent need to reform and restructurethe United Nations General Assembly and itssubsidiary bodies and agencies  as well as the SecurityCouncil and the Economic and Social Council  so as toreflect the recent dynamics and changes.The Security Council should be reformed andexpanded in both categories  permanent and non-permanent. It must take into account the interests ofboth the developed and developing countries.Although we are encouraged by the generalpositive signs of progress towards resolving conflictsand securing peace in several regions of the world Papua New Guinea remains concerned at thecontinuing conflict in the Middle East. We believeviolence will not resolve the conflict. We call on bothIsrael and the Palestinian leadership to come to thenegotiating table to discuss outstanding issues with theview to resolving the conflict peacefully.It would be remiss of me if I did not makemention of the fact that 11 September 2002 marked thefirst anniversary of the terrorist attacks in the UnitedStates of America. The Government and people ofPapua New Guinea express to the Government andpeople of the United States  and the families of thevictims drawn from many countries  our sympathy forthe tragedy and suffering of just a year ago  whenterrorism struck this great city of New York andWashington  D.C.  and Pennsylvania.Though distant from this tragic event  we share inthe deep sorrow felt around the world  and in theadmiration of the extraordinary bravery and sacrifice ofso many who engaged themselves in the rescue efforts.Our thoughts are with those who continue to mourn.Papua New Guinea joins with all the freedomloving nations and peoples of the world in condemningterrorism in all its evil forms. Terrorist attacks cannever be justified. Terrorism  in which the lives of themost innocent and vulnerable are so senselessly taken must be especially condemned.Papua New Guinea fully endorses and supportsall efforts towards the effective implementation of theUnited Nations Security Council resolution 1373(2001).You concluded your opening address to thisAssembly  Mr. President  by appealing to MemberStates to focus on what we have in common — andespecially our desire to live in a peaceful and secureworld where the values and principles expressed in theUnited Nations Charter are honoured. Papua NewGuinea shares your vision and the confidence thatunderpin your address.If the nations of the world — with our greatdiversity — focus on what we have in common  wewill build and secure a better world  one in which thebenefits of economic development are shared  and onein which the marvels of modern science andtechnology  including modern medicine  are harnessedfor the common good of humanity. But none of thesethings can be achieved without a genuine and lastingpeace.In conclusion  I want to reaffirm Papua NewGuinea's firm commitments to what I have outlinedand reiterate that global  regional and localpartnerships in promoting sustainable development isthe key to addressing the challenges that confront theworld today."
"138",5692,"POL",57,2002,"﻿I convey mycongratulations to Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to thepresidency of this body. I should also like to expressonce again to Secretary-General Kofi Annan myhighest appreciation and to assure him of my support.It is with satisfaction that Poland welcomes in ourmidst the newest Member of the United Nations Switzerland  and looks forward to welcoming soon theDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste.Wisława Szymborska  the Polish poet and NobelPrize winner  wrote the following words dedicated tothe victims of 11 September:“They plunged down from heights ablaze ...For them  I can do but two things — depict theirflight and leave the last sentence unfinished ...”I believe that every one of us travelling to thisbrave city shared similar thoughts. All of us must haveasked ourselves what is being expected of us  where weare today and what obligations we are to fulfil toensure that such horror never happens again. No doubt 11 September was a wake-up call for all of us. It mayhave not changed the world  but it certainly hasfundamentally changed the way we perceive it. Historyhas yet again given us the responsibility to face thechallenge and to leave a better and safer world forfuture generations. But then  after all  is that not whatwe are really here for?Many of my colleague representatives touchedupon that issue in recent days. The messages deliveredhere just four days ago by Secretary-General KofiAnnan and President George W. Bush are especiallysignificant. In that regard  we also share the opinionsexpressed by a number of other speakers  in particularby the Prime Minister of Denmark  Mr. Anders FoghRasmussen  speaking in his capacity as the President ofthe European Union.Today the United Nations stands at a crossroads facing a choice that needs to be made. Either we willfind internal strength to stand up to the challenge andprove that the United Nations is more than a merediscussion forum or we will lose credibility forever.Once again  as was the case at the inception of theOrganization over half a century ago  we must take theissue of security seriously  especially as terrorism hasgiven it a new dimension.As a founding Member of the United Nations Poland will continue to support all efforts aimed atpreserving the Organization's unique position. We fullyagree with what the Secretary-General said  that we canonly succeed if we make full use of multilateral21institutions. We share the position of President Bushthat the United Nations must be effective andsuccessful and that its resolutions must be enforced.We are convinced that the Security Council must findenough strength in the nearest future to set the coursefor a decision-making process in the United Nationsaimed at concrete action. This time  we are left with avery small margin. This is a test that internationalcommunity has to pass. Failure would undermine boththe integrity of the United Nations and the security ofthe whole world.I think the most appropriate motto for my furtherreflections on the future of the United Nations iscontained in the Secretary-General's millenniumreport. He wrote that“If the international community were tocreate a new United Nations tomorrow  its make-up would surely be different from the one wehave.” (A/54/2000  para. 352)It would be highly unfortunate if the millenniumreport  and especially its conclusions relating to therole of the United Nations and the reform of theOrganization  were to fade into oblivion. Only theUnited Nations  given its exceptional legitimacystemming from the universal character of both itsmembership and its mandate can — and  indeed  oughtto — rise to the challenges posed to the internationalcommunity. But for that to happen its prerogatives rules and instruments would have to be geared to theneeds of today and the threats of tomorrow.We should consider the elaboration of a documentthat would be neither a draft revision of the Charter nora supplement to it. What I would like to suggest is thatwe make an attempt to acknowledge the new realityand try a new road. I am by no means being original orprecedent-setting in calling for this. The AtlanticCharter and the New Atlantic Charter  the 1975Helsinki Final Act and the 1990 Charter of Paris for aNew Europe have all been there before. In other words adapting an organization's mandate to make it relevantto new needs without actually revising its founding acthas already been tested.There is a widespread sense that some provisionsof the United Nations Charter having actually become adead letter. That applies to both the substance of thoseprovisions and to the procedural solutions they offer.Some of the Charter's provisions and organs havecompleted the tasks assigned to them and are nowredundant. But the Organization does need newmechanisms to run peacekeeping operations. It isimpossible to comprehend why we still keep in placeclauses on “enemy States” while the United Nationshas no regulations to properly address the problemsrelated to its humanitarian interventions. There is ageneral acceptance of the need for clear lines to bedrawn to mark new areas of responsibility for a numberof important United Nations organs.The values  purposes and principles of the UnitedNations  enshrined in the Preamble and in Articles 1and 2 of the Charter  have not lost their relevance.They have stood the test of time. A document thatcould be considered as a new act for the UnitedNations at the dawn of the twenty-first century couldgive fresh impetus to the principles  organs andmechanisms of the United Nations and make themmore responsive to the needs and challenges that todaydominate the life of the international community. Letme point out four groups of problems that should betackled  starting with new threats to security.The Charter makes reference to threatstraditionally raised by States. The Charter's provisionsconcerning the Security Council and its compositionand instruments  as well as the other Chapters dealingwith security  are now insufficient. That fact is borneout by the numerous developments of recent years including the attack of 11 September and itsconsequences.Then there is acute poverty  which is evident inmany parts of the world; chronic underdevelopment;pandemic disease; lack of education and medical care;and deepening differences in living conditions anddevelopmental standards. All of these are unacceptablepolitically and morally.Human rights  the rule of law  democracy  goodgovernance and civil society make up the third groupof problems that I have been thinking about.The fourth group is made up of themes related tosustainable development. The focus on the protectionof the human habitat  which is indispensable to thesurvival of the human race  and on the commonheritage of mankind.Moreover  existing United Nations principlesmust be expanded  or new ones developed  in order forthe Organization to pursue its actions along thefollowing three dimensions  namely  in manifestations22of multilateralism in the work of the United Nationswhile reconciling broad representation and collectivismwith effectiveness; in the subsidiarity of theOrganization's work to better utilize the means andresources available to Member States  specifically withregard to United Nations regional arrangements; and finally  in getting non-governmental entities  includingprivate capital  involved in United Nations work in away that will not detract from the democratic nature ofthe Organization nor erode its governmental characterand efficiency while increasing its resources andeffectiveness.I dare say that no country  group of countries orregional agencies meeting the Organization's criteriawould be capable of taking up the totality of problemssuch an undertaking would have to address. Subject toappropriate consultations involving the membership ofthe Organization and the Secretary-General  we mightwish to establish a “group of sages” made up ofoutstanding personalities. The group would draft anappropriate document that would then be reviewed andapproved by Member States. That document should bepolitically binding in nature  which would make itcomplementary to the legal grounding contained in theCharter and provide a platform for the United Nationsactions over the coming decades.We should think about the future and work on itsfoundations  but without losing sight of present-dayachievements. The enactment of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court is one such achievement.It turns a new page in both international relations andinternational law. It is Poland's desire for the treatyestablishing the Court to become one of the mostuniversal documents of its kind. We trust that theexisting divergences between respective stands andviews can be resolved through dialogue andcompromise  according to international law. We have toact so as not to disappoint the hopes and expectationsthat the international community has placed in theCourt.A year ago  the whole world joined together in anunprecedented demonstration of solidarity. Today weare more aware of the source and the character of thethreat. We are also more capable of dealing with it.Poland has joined the ongoing anti-terrorist operation.Our soldiers are now deployed in Afghanistan alongside their colleagues from other countries  and aredoing their utmost to strengthen security there and tohelp raise the country from the rubble and ruin inflictedupon it by two decades of war and internal strife.For us that is natural  but we cannot avoid askingourselves the question of whether we are any closertoday to fulfilling the ideals towards which we set sailhalf a century ago. We now have another chance torevitalize solidarity and work together for values thatare priceless both to us and to generations to come. Letus all create an axis of good that will bring back theproper meaning to the term we are so proud of  theUnited Nations."
"139",5718,"PRK",57,2002,"﻿I would like tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election as President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. It isour expectation that your able stewardship will enable28the work of this session to result in tangible progress. Ialso appreciate the efforts of Secretary-General KofiAnnan towards international peace and sustainabledevelopment.I am going to contribute to the work of theGeneral Assembly by presenting a perspective on thesituation of the Korean peninsula  which remains amajor concern in terms of world peace and security.More than 50 years have passed since the divisionof Korea by outside forces. As the Korean peopleundergo immeasurable pain and misfortune due to thedivision of the country and the nation  the worldrealizes that  as long as the homogeneous Koreannation remains artificially divided  Korea will never bepeaceful  nor will peace and security be possible there.The Democratic People's Republic of Koreamade reunification the supreme national task from thefirst day of the division  and has since adhered to itsstand with respect to achieving reunificationindependently  through dialogue and negotiationbetween the North and South of Korea.The fatherly leader of our people  President KimIl Sung  long ago set forth the principles andprogrammes for reunifying the country independentlythrough peaceful national unity. He proposed achievingreunification by means of a federation system wheredifferent ideas and systems would continue to exist inthe North and the South. He devoted all his efforts tonational reunification up until the moment he died.The respected General Kim Jong Il has definedthree main charters for national reunification as: thethree principles of national reunification; the 10-PointProgramme for the Great Unity of the Whole Nation;and the proposal on founding the Democratic FederalRepublic of Koryo put forward by the fatherly leader.These provide a basis for the country's reunification.It is thanks to the ideas of national independenceand national unity of the respected General Kim Jong Ilthat the historic inter-Korean summit meeting tookplace in Pyongyang in June 2000 and that the North-South Joint Declaration was adopted; this served as aturning point in the efforts of the Korean people for thecountry's reunification. The 15 June 2000 North-SouthJoint Declaration is a declaration of nationalindependence and peaceful reunification calling foropposing foreign interference and achievingreunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreannation. After the publication of the North-South JointDeclaration  the North and the South held talks andengaged in contacts in various fields  seeking ways andmeans to achieve reconciliation and unity. Theydiscussed measures for cooperation  exchanges andrelaxation of tension in Korea; thus the spirit ofreunification on the Korean peninsula gainedmomentum.However  the positive development of inter-Korean relations was frustrated by the interference ofexternal forces  and the North-South Joint Declarationthus faced major obstacles.It is fortunate indeed that inter-Korean relationshave now been put back on track through the dialogueand contacts on implementing the Joint Declaration held in recent months at the initiative of theGovernment of the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea. The ministerial-level talks were resumed.Dialogue and contacts in other fields are under way and a national reunification meeting of compatriotsfrom the North  the South and overseas was heldsuccessfully on the occasion of the 15 August Koreanrestoration day.The North and the South have jointly introducedan agenda item entitled Peace  security andreunification on the Korean Peninsula' at the currentsession of the General Assembly and have agreed todraw up and submit a draft resolution under that item.Governments and peoples of many countries aresupporting and welcoming the emerging dÈtente on theKorean peninsula as well as the trend towardsreconciliation and cooperation between the North andthe South.The history of division for more than 50 years is aserious lesson for all Korean people. If thereunification of the country is to be achieved  the Northand the South should  above all  reject foreigninterference  which is a main obstacle to reunification and should join efforts on the basis of ideas of nationalindependence and great national unity.The modern history of Korea serves as a clearillustration of the high price paid and the greatsacrifices made in succumbing to foreign interventionand relying on outside forces. The division of Koreawas imposed by outside forces after the Second WorldWar. It was neither the will nor a requirement of theKorean people. It is none other than those same foreign29forces that continue to shadow inter-Korean relations atevery stage of their favourable development and thatundermine the interests of the Korean nation. Recourseto foreign forces and complicit action with themagainst fellow countrymen are inevitably destined tolead to mistrust and confrontation in inter-Koreanrelations.We are firmly convinced that we can resolve allproblems in the interests of the Korean nation bytranscending the differences in ideologies and systemsexisting between the North and the South  if the Northand the South sit together in the spirit of nationalindependence and the love of country and people.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will in the future  make every effort to achieve independentreunification through a federation system that unitesthe strength of the entire Korean nation in the spirit ofthe North-South Joint Declaration.In order to ensure peace and security on theKorean peninsula and realize reunification  the hostilepolicy of the United States against the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea should be terminated.The United States defines the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea as its prime enemy' thatposes a threat' to it. It also designates us as the axisof evil' and target of a pre-emptive nuclear strike' onthe pretext of anti-terrorism ' thus further aggravatingthe situation.It is quite unreasonable that the United Statesantagonizes and threatens us with the use of force forthe sole reason that the Democratic People's Republicof Korea firmly adheres to an independent policy andholds different values and ideas. This also contravenesthe United Nations Charter and the norms ofinternational relations. It is entirely as a result of theconsistent peace-loving policy and efforts of theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea that peace ismaintained on the Korean peninsula.Our position on relations between the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea and the United States isever principled and consistent. If the United Statesrespects our system and sovereignty and takes anattitude of goodwill towards us  we can developrelations with the United States based on the principlesof equality and mutual benefit. The DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea considers that it is mostreasonable to solve pending issues between itself andthe United States through dialogue and negotiations.We had therefore already agreed to the UnitedStates suggestion that it send a special envoy with aview to presenting its position on the resumption ofdialogue. Furthermore  during the conversationbetween our Foreign Minister and United StatesSecretary of State at the 9th meeting of the Associationof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forumin July  we again welcomed the United Stateswillingness to send its special envoy to Pyongyang.The point is that trustful dialogue can be resumedonly when the United States refrains from its hostilepolicy against the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea and maintains a position of equality with us.If the United States intends to have a substantialdialogue with us on the principle of sovereign equality we will respond accordingly. This will facilitateconfidence-building between the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea and the United States and open upthe prospect for hammering out a fair solution to thepending issues.The United Nations should also do its due part forthe peace and security of Korea. In this regard  I wishto remind you that immeasurable suffering andmisfortune were imposed on the Korean peninsulaunder the name and flag of the United Nations. It ishighly expected that the United Nations will soon seekto redress the abnormal circumstances under which itsname has been misused for over 50 years.We take pride in contributing positively to peaceand security on the Korean peninsula  the NortheastAsian region and the world in general  even under theconstant threats and confrontations that have persistedfor more than 50 years.Our great leader  General Kim Jong Il  leads ourpeople wisely with his army-based policies aimed atdefending the country  building a powerful nation andproviding for a favourable environment for peace andreunification in Korea  thanks to his energetic anduntiring external activities.The respected General Kim Jong Il had a meetingwith President Putin in the Far East region of theRussian Federation in August this year  and is holdingtalks with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japanin Pyongyang today  17 September. These contactsserve as turning points in the development of relations30between the Democratic People's Republic of Koreaand Russia  the normalization of relations between theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and Japan  andalso serve as a great contribution to world peace security and the creation of a new and just worldstructure.Our people will  in the future  firmly defend oursocialist system and achieve peace and thereunification of the Korean peninsula under theoutstanding army-based leadership of the respectedGeneral Kim Jong Il  thus fulfilling our mission forpeace and security in the world.Radical changes have taken place in theinternational arena since the 11 September incident.'Attempts to expand the war against terrorism' withoutjustifiable reasons continue and the policy of powersupremacy has emerged  openly advocating a theory ofpre-emptive nuclear attack beyond the doctrine ofnuclear deterrence  thus further challenging worldpeace and security.Hunger  poverty and external debts have becomeworse  while the inequality in international economicand trade relations and the gap between the rich and thepoor have widened further. All these actions and eventsin international relations entirely contravene the spiritof the United Nations Charter.My delegation considers that the most pressingtask before United Nations Members today is to respectand uphold the spirit enshrined in the United NationsCharter. Above all  the sovereignty and equality of allcountries should be respected. The use of force  theapplication of coercive measures and  in particular unilateral acts should not be allowed in internationalrelations.To this end  the power of the United NationsGeneral Assembly should be decisively enhanced. TheGeneral Assembly should be empowered to review theissues concerning international peace and security andto approve major decisions of the Security Council inthis regard. At present  the General Assembly is noteven properly carrying out its intrinsic power asstipulated in the United Nations Charter.International issues  such as conflict resolution disarmament  terrorism and sustainable development should be discussed and decided with the fullparticipation of all United Nations Members  inconformity with the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations.It is also important that democracy andimpartiality be ensured in all United Nations activitiesand the work of reforming the Security Council  inparticular  is undertaken to make it true to its mainpurpose. The Security Council should be reformed insuch a way as to properly reflect present reality  wherealmost all countries have become United NationsMembers  and fully ensure impartiality and democracy.In order to achieve the purposes of the UnitedNations  fair international economic and trade relationsshould be established and the right to developmentrespected. Unless the present unfair internationaleconomic system is redressed  poverty cannot beeliminated  nor can the gap between the rich and thepoor be removed  nor sustainable development for allbe ensured.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will as ever  make all efforts to uphold and achieve thepurposes and principles of the United Nations on thebasis of the ideas of independence  peace andfriendship."
"140",5763,"PRT",57,2002,"﻿The internationalagenda was forever changed by the events of 11September 2001. The challenge created for the UnitedNations was  and is  the same as that for each of itsMembers: how best to react to those changes. Theinternational fight against terrorism has thus become atop priority for all of us. It is not only a fight againstindividuals who conspire to kill innocent people; it isalso  in itself  a fight for respect for human life andhuman dignity  for the values of liberty  tolerance anddemocracy and for the peaceful solution of conflicts.The United Nations immediately pledged itsMembers to the struggle through a swift reaction by theGeneral Assembly and by the Security Council  whichstated that the terrorist attacks of 11 September were athreat to international peace and security and whichadopted a resolution  sending out a remarkable signalof strength  quickly followed by other internationalorganizations  such as the European Union and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE).As members are aware  Portugal currently holdsthe chairmanship of the OSCE. We have made the fightagainst terrorism a priority on the OSCE's agenda. AsChairman-in-Office  I have been working towards aEuropean charter on preventing and fighting terrorism to be adopted at the ministerial meeting to be held inPortugal next December.But the United Nations is in a unique position tocoordinate and invigorate the international response toterrorism. We are called upon to demonstrate that aworld in which humanity can live free from fear is notonly a common aspiration but also an achievable goal.We trust that the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly will live up to their responsibilities in thatregard. Failure to do so would seriously compromisethe credibility of the Organization.(spoke in Portuguese; English text furnished by thedelegation)At the same time that the world faces the newchallenge of terrorism  old challenges persist. TheMiddle East demands a new peace dynamic. Theevolution of the Iraqi issue must entail absolute respectfor Security Council resolutions and the unconditionalreturn of United Nations inspectors. Indeed  weconsider the problem concerning Iraq often to bewrongfully presented: Iraq is a threat to internationalsecurity  and thus pressure must be exerted on Iraq  noton the United Nations or on one particular country. It isIraq that is failing to comply with United Nationsresolutions. Our goal is to put an end to the threatrepresented by weapons of mass destruction. TheUnited Nations and its Members cannot and must notcontinue to tolerate the continuous violation ofSecurity Council resolutions. Thus  the internationalcommunity must know how to act effectively and mustbe particularly demanding on this issue.The Security Council should promptly make astatement on Iraq's lack of compliance with Councilresolutions and on its obligations. It is now up to Iraqto seize this opportunity and to cooperate with theUnited Nations. But  should Iraq persist in notcomplying fully with the Organization within a timeframe to be determined  the international communityshould not exclude any alternative or option.On the other hand  two success stories from thepast year deserve a special reference. First  in Angola peace was achieved and seems irreversible. Portugalwill continue to work with the Angola's Governmentand political forces towards the full implementation ofthe Lusaka Protocol. The United Nations mustcontribute to that process. Humanitarian assistance isvital for the consolidation of the peace process. Thosesteps  along with free elections and a modern economicframework  will surely strengthen peace anddemocracy in that country.Secondly  East Timor's proclamation ofindependence on 20 May represents a success for thepeople of East Timor  for the United Nations and forthose who fought for it. The General Assembly willsoon proclaim East Timor a new Member. Anindependent East Timor within the United Nationsdeeply touches the Portuguese people  who havealways believed in the rights of East Timor's peopleand in the justice of their cause. East Timor startedfrom scratch. It is now up to the internationalcommunity to maintain its support  lest it squander theopportunity to meet the challenges of that new country.I turn now to a number of other noteworthymatters. As a founding party to the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court  Portugal believes that theelection of a first team of judges will be a crucial steptowards the Court's effective functioning and20credibility. That institution and its regular functioningmust become a fixture of the international scene.The New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD) underlines the preoccupation of Africancountries with the values of democracy and humanrights  as well as sustainable economic developmentand the continent's integration into economicglobalization. Bearing such concerns in mind  Portugalwill organize the next conference between theEuropean Union and Africa  to be held in April 2003.Africa is a priority for us. Therefore  we supportinitiatives to energize the development policies andeconomies of that forgotten continent.Finally  we welcome Switzerland's accession tomembership of the United Nations. The presence of theSwiss Confederation will certainly benefit UnitedNations action.(spoke in English)The way in which the world embraces the newchallenges it faces will be the best indication that theevents of one year ago resulted in a triumph for theinternational community. A safer world is founded onsecure countries representing all their people and livingin peace. That is how terrorism will eventually bedefeated  and out of that the new international ordershould gradually emerge.Security can no longer be conceived inexclusively military terms or solely in terms ofterritorial defence. Several factors must be taken intoconsideration: the widespread development of weaponsof mass destruction; the proliferation of other threats such as environmental degradation  diseases such asHIV/AIDS  famine and migration  which transcendState borders; and factors affecting the ability of manyStates to face the challenge of globalization. Thus  nonation  however powerful  is self-sufficient; not eventhe greatest of countries can do everything on its own.Multilateral cooperation is the key to the future. One ofthe basic goals of the United Nations should be toimplement such cooperation in a practical andconsistent manner."
"141",5809,"PRY",57,2002,"﻿First of all  I wish to express my thanks to theAssembly for having come to hear Paraguay's position.Secondly  I must apologize if I am interrupting yourluncheon.Let me begin my statement in this general debateby expressing my delegation's gratification at seeingyou  Sir  preside over the work of this Assembly. Yourpersonal and professional qualities will guarantee thatour work is successful  and you may rely on theconstant and resolute support of the Paraguayandelegation. We also wish to take this opportunity toexpress our thanks to Secretary-General Kofi Annanfor the report that he has presented on the work of ourOrganization  which confirms how essential this workis in the context of today's world. There is a need forall States members not simply to support that work  butalso to make it even stronger and more flexible inresponding to fresh challenges.Allow me also to welcome and express mycountry's satisfaction at seeing the accession to thisOrganization of the Swiss Confederation  as well as theupcoming addition of Timor-Leste. With these newMembers we take an important step forward towardsachieving the universality to which the Organizationaspires.The events of the last year  some auspicious others discouraging  have given us resounding proof ofthe role of the United Nations and the fact that theOrganization's reform is now  more than ever before  apressing and urgent challenge. I am thinking of theneed for a thorough reform of its organs and structure as well as of its functions  and of changes that wouldequip this Organization to respond more effectively tothe fresh challenges that are emerging with unexpectedspeed on the international scene.Who would have thought  when this Organizationwas founded more than 50 years ago  that at thiscurrent General Assembly session we would beextending a welcome in the United Nations to two newMember States: Switzerland  a State that has alwaysheld its place and played its role in history and on theinternational scene; and Timor-Leste  whose birth wewitnessed just a few months ago  thanks to a largeextent to United Nations intervention? Nor could wehave imagined just a few decades ago that this year wewould have witnessed one of the most important and2anticipated events in the area of human rights  thatis  the establishment of the International CriminalCourt. Who would have thought that one year ago  on11 September 2001  we would have been eyewitnessesto one of the most tragic and incomprehensible eventsin history  the history not only of the United Statesof America  but also of the whole of humankind  andthat immediately thereafter the internationalcommunity would unite and respond most decisively incombating international terrorism?Those events show us that today's world is notthe same as that of the Organization's founders. Amongother reasons  they determine and require reform of ourinstitution. That is why it is necessary that we givepriority to the work of the United Nations  not only sothat the Organization responds efficiently to politicalevents  but also to ensure sustainable development sothat its benefits reach every individual  wherever hemay live  work and have a home.Undoubtedly  a renewed and reorganized UnitedNations will ultimately respond to the well-being ofevery one of our citizens. The decisions that we take inthat regard over the next months will define and guideour countries and humanity in the future. Thus wecannot limit ourselves to superficial or simplyprocedural actions; we must achieve a genuinetransformation.In that regard  we must reaffirm first of all thecentral role to be played by the General Assembly asthe principal organ of the United Nations  since it is themost representative  democratic  universal andequitable deliberating organ. The Assembly shouldbecome the world's parliament  in which allcountries  regardless of their size or position  canexpound  debate  dissent  express their views and sharepositions on the most important current issues. Itcannot continue to be the arena where we come toparticipate merely to carry out a routine function basedon a pre-established and repetitive agenda  and inwhich our statements are mere rhetoric that is scarcelylistened to by any other delegation. Therefore  wefirmly support the process of revitalizing the Assembly which should continue and should focus in thatdirection. The changes must be genuine and profoundso as to enhance the Assembly's effectiveness andefficiency.No reform of the United Nations will have theeffect that we all wish for without the much-awaitedreform of the Security Council. Until that body responsible for maintaining international peace andsecurity  is reformed  we will not be able to speak ofan Organization that is in accord with the time in whichwe live. That is why we should expand both categoriesof members  permanent and non-permanent  andinclude both developed and developing countries taking into particular account that the latter arecurrently under-represented in such an important body.At the same time  reform should include the gradualabolition of the right of veto for permanent membersuntil it disappears  making the Council fairer and moredemocratic. We believe that the time has come toassume our political responsibility in the settlement ofthis matter.One year after the tragic events of 11 September we need to ask ourselves what implications they havehad  as much for this Organization as for each countrydomestically. Paraguay took a firm position ofcondemning international terrorism  fullyimplementing the measures imposed by the SecurityCouncil and promoting the validity of the numerousrelevant international agreements. My Governmentresponded to the requirements of Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001)  and to date it has presented tworeports to the Committee established pursuant to thatresolution. I here reaffirm our commitment to continueto cooperate with the Committee in its efforts  as wehave been doing on the regional and subregional levels.Moreover  I should like to report that Paraguay  inkeeping with its constitutional process  is becoming aparty to the 12 international agreements on terrorismand was one of the first countries to sign the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism  adopted in theframework of the Organization of American States.We firmly support the strengthening of aninternational legal basis for combating terrorism. Thatis why we hope that during this session of the GeneralAssembly  negotiations on the comprehensiveinternational convention against terrorism  aproposal presented by India  will be concluded  aswell as the Russian Federation's proposal for aninternational convention for the suppression of acts ofnuclear terrorism.One achievement of far-reaching importance thisyear was the entry into force of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court on 1 July  and we aregratified to be one of the first 66 countries whoseratification of the Rome Statute made this possible. We3are convinced that the Court will be a deterrent tounacceptable human rights abuses and crimes againsthumanity. Likewise  we are certain that the work of theCourt will not be tarnished or manipulated by anypolitical influence and that its independence impartiality and purpose will be preserved. Paraguayappeals to all countries that have not yet signed orratified the Statute to do so as soon as possible  sincethe Court's universality is fundamental to itseffectiveness. My country has followed very closelythe recent debate on the Court's competence to judgehypothetical offences  committed in the course ofUnited Nations peacekeeping operations  in whichpersonnel in the service of countries that have notsigned or ratified the Statute might be involved.We welcome the Secretary-General's appointmentof the new High Commissioner for Human Rights. Weare certain that  as a Latin American  he will do honourto that appointment  which was confirmed by theAssembly. We share his desire to build a human rightsagenda that will not divide peoples and States  butrather unite them more. Paraguay will provide all thesupport necessary to ensure that his mission issuccessful.For the first time  Paraguay will become amember of the United Nations Commission on HumanRights  as of January 2003  and I should like to takethis opportunity to reaffirm my Government'scommitment to cooperate with and contribute to thatbody's important and altruistic work. We are preparedto work with the other members of the Commission aswell as with other States and entities.Today we face a complex world that is still farfrom forming a stable international order. We continueto witness confrontations in various regions of theworld. That is why we must devote all our efforts andresources to the reconciliation of humanity. TheRepublic of Paraguay will always invoke and supportthe peaceful settlement of conflicts through dialogue mutual understanding and international law.In that regard  we see grounds for grave concernin the serious worsening of the situation in the MiddleEast: the spiral of violence  the alarming humanitariansituation and the violation of the fundamental rights ofthe civilian population as well as the loss of innocentlives among both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.We resolutely support the work of the `quartet'and of the international community in general in theirefforts to secure a resumption of negotiations and thusbring about much-desired peace in the region. At thesame time  as a country that abides strictly byinternational law  Paraguay regrets the fact that theresolutions adopted by the Security Council on thisquestion this year  which contain clear terms andreferences  have still not been implemented by theparties.Paraguay would underscore once again the urgentneed to achieve a just and lasting peace in the MiddleEast on the basis of Security Council resolutions especially 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 1397 (2002)  inorder to pave the way for the peaceful coexistence oftwo independent States  Israel and Palestine  withinsecure and internationally recognized borders.My country  Paraguay  has been following closelythe situation in Afghanistan. We welcome the presencein this general debate of President Karzai  whodeserves our recognition and our firm support in hisefforts to fulfil his responsibilities and to carry out thetasks that lie ahead of him. The internationalcommunity is committed to continuing to supportAfghanistan so as to enable it to achieve the stabilityand development that its people so desire.The Government of Paraguay  in keeping with theposition it has been maintaining and expressingconcerning the question of the Republic of China onTaiwan  would once again reaffirm its strong wish thatthis issue be considered within the framework ofuniversality embodied in our Charter and on the basisof norms of international law  in order to achieve asatisfactory solution through dialogue among theparties concerned.This year has been marked by importantconferences. The World Assembly on Ageing inMadrid  the special session on children  the MonterreyConference  the Johannesburg Summit and the WorldFood Summit took place in a context of increasingdeterioration in the socio-economic conditionsaffecting many of our peoples  thus heighteningfrustration and despair because of the lack of tangibleand concrete results. In order to prevent the situationfrom persisting  what is needed on the one hand isurgent political resolve on the part of all MemberStates to implement and fulfil the commitmentsundertaken at those conferences and  on the other hand an increase in the participation and integration ofdeveloping countries in the process of global politicaldecision-making.4Consequently  Paraguay has been striving tochannel the limited resources at its disposal into areasof pressing priority in the social and economic fields particularly in the areas of education and health  to thepoint where now they represent a majority ofParaguay's national budget. We have also reducedmilitary expenditure to below 1 per cent of grossdomestic product  the lowest level in our history. Wehave also been giving priority to State expendituredirected at building road and energy infrastructure which will make it possible to integrate Paraguay intothe transport and energy corridors that will link theAtlantic and Pacific oceans in South America.Sustainable development in its broadestdefinition  as we addressed it at Johannesburg increasingly requires shared solutions in a globalizedworld as well as differentiated commitments. For thisreason  we deem it essential that the industrializedcountries share in and support our development plans.Official development assistance should play only acomplementary role that will enable us to incorporate in a timely manner  the available financial resources from both internal and external sources  so as toenable smaller countries to be properly incorporatedinto a competitive and independent world.One of the instruments that is constantly touted asa producer of development is free trade. Thedeveloping countries want to see free trade on a doubletrack. We want to have access to the markets of thedeveloped countries  and we wish to see theelimination of measures that distort trade  such asagricultural subsidies  domestic export assistance andthe abuse of anti-dumping measures.If these protectionist practices persist  they willdelay our countries' participation in the supposedbenefits that  we believe  stem from free trade and willalso considerably worsen the social divide in all itsmanifestations. Combating poverty is not just apolitical commitment but  above all  a moral one.Paraguay welcomes the General Assembly's planto devote a day  16 September  to consideringways and means of providing support to the NewPartnership for Africa's Development. High-levelplenary sessions and interactive round tables will beheld. We trust that the outcome will make a decisivecontribution to promoting renewed commitments to thesocial and economic development of the whole of theAfrican continent.The International Ministerial Meeting ofLandlocked Developing Countries and TransitDeveloping Countries will be held next year. It willaddress the problems that beset countries such as myown  such as integration into international markets excessive costs related to transit transport  customsdelays  restrictions and technical barriers to trade  aswell as the need for financial support and the requisiteinvestment in infrastructure and capacity developmentin order to overcome the disadvantages that stem frombeing landlocked.Paraguay has offered to host the subregionalLatin American preparatory meeting for the MinisterialMeeting  with a view to defining clearly all of thenecessary measures to establish our country'srequirements  in particular with respect to thedifferential treatment to be given to landlockedcountries  through tangible commitments in the areasof transport  customs and duty-free zones and in thearea of opening markets through reduced customstariffs  the elimination of special excise duties andother measures that hinder the competitiveparticipation in international trade of landlockeddeveloping countries.Paraguay  in the context of its democratizationprocess  to which all citizens are committed at theState  regional and municipal levels  will be holdingelections in April next year  which will once againconfirm the consolidation of our democracy.Unfortunately  as in many other countries of the world and especially in Latin America today  the democraticsystem is threatened by heightened poverty and theserious economic situation  which has caused the livingconditions of our citizens to deteriorate. For thatreason  our country must also receive the considerationthat it deserves in the context of efforts to findsolutions to these problems.I trust that the Organization and the financialagencies and their principal members will respondappropriately at the right time.In concluding my last address to this plenary ashead of State of the Republic of Paraguay  my termof office  according to the Constitution  ends on 15August 2003  I wish to reaffirm my country'scommitment to this Organization and its trust that it  inturn  will respond to the hopes and expectations of abetter future for our peoples."
"142",5828,"PSE",57,2002,"﻿Icongratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to thepresidency of the fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations. We are confident thatyou will conduct the proceedings of this session withgreat competence  thanks to your outstanding skills andqualities.I should like to pay tribute also to yourpredecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  who presided ablyover the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.Let me also express my deep appreciation for theefforts of the Secretary-General to harmonizeinternational relations and to ensure respect for theprinciples of the Charter with a view to strengtheninginternational peace and security.I wish also to welcome Switzerland and Timor-Leste to the United Nations.31We have agreed to the American politicalinitiative that was put forward in 1991. At the MadridConference  several agreements were entered into bythe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) representing the Palestinian people  and Israel. The aimof those agreements was the commencement ofnegotiations between the two parties with a view to theimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973). They also called on Israel towithdraw from the Arab territories occupied since1967.A deadline of five years was set for thosenegotiations. The clock began to run after the signingof the Oslo Accords in 1993 in Washington  under theauspices of the previous United States President President Clinton.However  successive Israeli Governments haverefused to withdraw from the occupied Palestinianterritories and have continued to deploy Israeli forcesthere. This intransigence on the part of Israel highlightsits goal: the continued occupation of Palestinianterritories.During the course of those negotiations  newsettlements were built  187 altogether  inhabited bysome 370 000 settlers  most of them armed. Recently Israel began building a wall along the line of the 1967truce. Israel is continuing its cruel and barbaric actsand carrying out its scorched-earth policy  with a viewto depriving the Palestinian people of their income andmeans of subsistence. During the past two years ofconflict  agricultural production has dropped by 80 percent and industrial production by 60 per cent.Unemployment has reached 65 per cent  and 63 percent of the population is living in poverty.Israel has destroyed public institutions  policestations  ports and airports. More than 1 350 houseshave been torn down  and more than 3 000 businessesand industrial concerns in the occupied territories andin Gaza have been demolished  an area of 5 800 squarekilometres.The taxes that Israel collects  about $850 million which should have been paid to the PalestinianAuthority  have been kept by the Israelis. A total of90 000 olive trees  out of 300 000  have been uprooted and the Palestinian infrastructure has been demolished.The occupied territories were divided into 227 separatecantons. Trade was halted  measures were taken tocurtail the freedom of movement of people and ofgoods  and borders with Arab countries were closed. Inaddition  the Israeli authorities have placed PresidentArafat under house arrest.These arbitrary measures have prompted thePalestinian people to pursue their heroic resistance  inthe face of Israel's various lethal weapons  which areused to enforce the separation between the cantons. InBethlehem  in Gaza and in other cities  residential areashave been bombed. Moreover  many Palestinians havebeen thrown into jail.The fact-finding team set up by the SecurityCouncil was prevented from going into the field towitness firsthand the suffering of the Palestinian peopleat the hands of the Nazi Israeli occupation.The United States is a great Power and bears animportant responsibility vis-‡-vis the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and the prevention ofregional conflict. Moreover  the United States hascommitted itself to working with the former SovietUnion  through the United Nations  to resolve conflictsby peaceful means and to eliminate their arsenals ofweapons of mass destruction.This is a very important approach that enables theUnited Nations to enhance fruitful internationalcooperation among States. Should that approach beabandoned  the United Nations will fail to developinternational cooperation and to maintain internationalpeace and security. The use of force in the context ofintra-State relations to resolve problems does not helpus in any way to uphold the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations. On the contrary; it only gives riseto fear and doubt among the States Members of theUnited Nations  especially developing countries  whichhave always turned to the Organization to protect them.The peoples of the world are looking to theUnited States in the hope that that major Power willplay a positive and neutral role in internationalrelations and in the hope that it will always be a sourceof technological and economic assistance.It goes without saying that the commitment of theUnited States to the strict implementation of UnitedNations resolutions  in particular those of theSecurity Council  without the use of a doublestandard strengthens our trust in the United Nationsand reinforces its credibility as a forum for theresolution of international problems.32Thus we are justified in asking ourselves whetherthese humanitarian and political responsibilities areincumbent on the United States in this era ofglobalization. We might ask ourselves why the UnitedStates is threatening to use force against Iraq  whensanctions have been imposed on that country for morethan 10 years.Why does the United States not speak of theelimination of the weapons of mass destructionpossessed by Israel  which threaten the Arab States  aswas noted previously? Israel could destroy theEgyptian high dam  even though a peace agreementwas signed between Israel and Egypt more than 24years ago. Mr. Hans Blix has stated that he had noevidence that Iraq had any weapons of massdestruction.When the political negotiations began  the Arabcountries took a neutral position. Israeli PrimeMinisters Rabin and Peres visited certain Arab Statesand an attempt was made to normalize Israeli-Arabrelations. When Yitzhak Rabin was killed in 1995 andauthority was handed over to Mr. Netanyahu  progresstowards peace was impeded. The Arab countries haltedthe process of normalizing relations with Israel.Nevertheless  at the 1996 Arab Summit they said thatpeace was an Arab strategy that would not beabandoned. Despite five years of negotiations betweenIsraelis and Palestinians  however  expectations werenot fulfilled.Great sacrifices were made on our part. Duringthe Camp David summit  an aide to President Clintondenied that Barak wanted to give the Palestinians alarge part of Palestinian territory. Israel was to keep 10per cent of the territory along the Jordanian border with three early-warning systems in the West Bank andthe establishment of a mutilated Palestinian State withno sovereignty.The events of 11 September 2001 led to ahumanitarian catastrophe that shook the conscience ofthe world. All countries of the world  including Araband Muslim countries  stood in solidarity with theAmerican people and expressed their intention tocombat terrorism in all its forms. We were surprised however  that the United States Administration refusedto acknowledge that the Sharon Government wasperpetrating acts of State terrorism. The Arabs putforward a political initiative at the Arab Summit inMarch  in the hope that they would be able to make aneffective contribution to ending the Arab-Israeliconflict with a view to ratifying a peace agreementwith Israel. This Arab initiative  which provided for awithdrawal by Israel from lands occupied since 1967and the establishment of a Palestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital  was endorsed and welcomed by theUnited States and the European States. It is not enough however  to merely welcome the initiative. We believethat implementing it would make a political settlementpossible. Expressions of compassion and sympathy arewelcome but they must be supported by concreteactions if a settlement is to be achieved. The Arabinitiative includes all the essential principles necessaryfor a settlement  in accordance with the provisions ofthe Madrid Agreement and the principle of land forpeace.Security Council resolution 1397 (2002) wenteven further in supporting the establishment of aPalestinian State that would be recognized by Israel.This was accompanied by an American proposal. IfIsrael rejects this comprehensive and fair proposal how much longer can it expect to continue in thisclimate of animosity towards Arabs and constantthreats to their security? How long can Israel continueto occupy Arab territory and prevent Palestinianrefugees from returning home? The question ofPalestine cannot be separated from the situation of theArab States  given all that the issue represents for themand for their future.Israel must end the acts of aggression that itcontinues to perpetrate against Palestinians and theirtowns. The Israeli army is continuing to assassinatecivilians and police and security officers. Sharon hasbeen described as a man of peace  and it has been saidthat Israel has a right to self-defence  even as itcontinues to occupy Arab territories and commitmassacres. The situation on the ground defies theimagination; it is very difficult to find a way to justifythe American policy. If the threat of terrorism isallowed to rule our lives  the world will become abattlefield.In conclusion  we and the other Arab countrieswelcomed the American statement on the establishmentof a Palestinian State. We reaffirm  however  that theborders of that State should be based on thedemarcation line of 4 June 1967  in accordance withCouncil resolutions. Its sovereignty must be assured and Israeli forces must be withdrawn from all theterritory. We cannot agree to any temporary borders.33We want a lasting settlement in keeping with the Arabinitiative put forward by Prince Abdullah of SaudiArabia  an initiative that is in keeping with relevantSecurity Council resolutions and with the principles ofthe peace process.We appreciate the role that the Quartet is playingin the peace process. No party should call upon thePalestinians alone to meet their demands. The Israeliforces must be called upon to revise their strategy andthe Israeli side must end its assassinations and attacksagainst citizens and refrain from using collectiveeconomic sanctions  occupation and terrorism as a tool.Israel must halt its ongoing assault  lift the siegethat has been imposed upon the Palestinian people andwithdraw completely from the occupied territories sothat the Palestinian Authority can implement thepromised reforms and hold elections in the West Bankand Gaza  as well as in Al-Quds  under internationalauspices. There should be an international presence toguarantee the protection of the Palestinian people. Thisis a matter of urgency; the siege that is impeding thedaily life of our citizens must be lifted."
"143",5874,"QAT",57,2002,"﻿I would like to thank you Sir  for giving me the floor. Allow me to congratulateyou warmly on your assumption of the presidency ofthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly ofthe United Nations. We have no doubt that yourexperience  wisdom and infinite patience will lead usto a successful outcome of the work of this session.Through you  allow me to congratulate Mr. HansSeung-soo on his presidency over the fifty-sixthsession of the General Assembly  which he conductedwith skill and ability. I would also like to thankSecretary-General Kofi Annan  who leads theSecretariat at a very delicate and difficult time in thehistory of the Organization  a time when it faces manychallenges  pressures and a serious situation of threatsto international peace and security.I am honoured and pleased to congratulate oursister State of East Timor on its independence andaccession to the United Nations  which represents thehope of all the peoples of the world to achieve theirfreedom. I would also like to warmly welcome theSwiss Confederation  which has become a full Memberof the United Nations.Since the convening of the last session  we haveseen very important events in the international arena  inthe wake of the terrorist attack against the World TradeCentre in New York. That led to unprecedentedcomplications in politics and international relations.Those political and social changes are accelerating andlead daily to new patterns of conflict.With respect to combating terrorism  Qatar  as theChair of the ninth Islamic summit  called for anemergency meeting of the Foreign Ministers of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference in Doha inOctober 2001. That Conference clearly condemned allacts of international terrorism  including Stateterrorism. It also affirmed the urgent need to agreeupon an international definition of terrorism distinguishing between terrorism and legitimateresistance to foreign aggression and occupation for thepurpose of national liberation and self-determination.I would like to recall from this rostrum that weare fully convinced of the validity of the UnitedNations Charter and of the leading role played by theOrganization in the maintenance of international peaceand security  as well as in ensuring the development prosperity and dignity of humankind.Here  we have to refer firmly to the need for thework of the Security Council to be transparent and theneed to renounce the selective implementation of theprovisions of the United Nations Charter. There is noescaping reviewing the permanent membership of theSecurity Council so that a select few will not be able tocontinue to use the veto  which can literally invalidatethe opinions of all others  while the United Nationspreaches democracy  participation  justice and equality.The practices of the Organization must becompletely impartial. The needed measures for themaintenance of international peace and security mustbe applied to all without exception and withoutpreferential treatment. We cannot allow the resolutionsof the Security Council to be based on double standardsor to be selective in a way that allows Israel not toimplement the resolutions adopted by the SecurityCouncil and the General Assembly.We cannot accept that the people of Palestine andthe Arab people in the occupied Syrian Golan Heightsand in the south of Lebanon are falling prey to thebarbaric aggression of the Israeli occupation forcesbefore the eyes of the whole world and world publicopinion. Israel violates the resolutions of internationallaw  rejecting them without any reaction from theSecurity Council or any organs of the United Nationsto put an end to it.We observe closely and with concern thedeteriorating security situation in the Palestinianterritories and the blatant challenge to the internationalcommunity and international laws and norms posed bythe siege of President Arafat and the legitimate  electedleadership of the Palestinian people. We observe withconcern the assassination  abduction and arrest ofPalestinian leaders  as well as the demolition of houseson the heads of women  children and the elderly. Wewatch closely and with concern the attacks on holyplaces  which have been condemned by all states andrepresentatives of international humanitarianorganizations  including the International Committee of29the Red Cross  which strongly deplored andcondemned those attacks.The actions of Israeli forces in Jenin and Gazaand the massacres perpetrated there constitute blatantviolations of modern international humanitarian law international human rights and internationalconventions  particularly the Fourth GenevaConvention relative to the Protection of CivilianPersons in Time of War of 1949. If it really intends toachieve security  Israel must take the route of peace byimplementing the resolutions of international law: theresolutions of the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly. They all provide for the inalienable right ofthe Palestinian people to achieve their legitimatenational aspirations  including self-determination andthe establishment of an independent State on itsnational territory with East Jerusalem as its capital.Those resolutions also call for the withdrawal from theoccupied Syrian territory of the Golan to the line of 4June 1967  as well as from the rest of occupiedLebanese territory.Among the prerequisites required to ensure aprosperous life for humankind is the basic right to livewithout discrimination based on ethnicity  race  colour ideology  language  wealth or social origin.As a people who believe in a revealed religion we believe in respecting human rights  because  inaddition to our common laws  we have a divine law laid down in the Koran  that tells us to respect suchrights. In Qatar  we protect and maintain human rightsand have made them the standard for our religion andfor our progress. Many countries accuse certainorganizations that profess concern for human rights ofbias  selectivity and double standards because theyconcentrate on political and civil rights without payingany heed to economic  social or cultural rights  whichare no less important than civil or political rights.Important as they are  civil and political rights maybecome devoid of content if we fail to pay heed to theother rights.Qatar has made many advances in the protectionof human rights  of the rule of law and of the principlesof democracy and Shura  as well as good governance.We have just completed a new national Constitutionthat provides for public freedoms and freeparliamentary elections. It also  for the first time  giveswomen the full right to vote and to be represented.We in the Middle East are threatened by a clearimbalance of power. Israel is the only country in theregion that possesses an arsenal of nuclear weaponsand refuses to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We appeal to allpeace-loving countries to demand that Israel accede tothe Treaty and submit its nuclear installations to thesafeguards system of the International Atomic EnergyAgency.At the present time  we see a positive direction incertain international issues. With regard to the situationin Iraq  we welcome that country's acceptance of thereturn of international inspectors and its avowedcommitment to implement relevant Security Councilresolutions and to resume dialogue with the UnitedNations. We reaffirm the need to maintain Iraq'ssovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  andwe hope that resumed dialogue will lead to acomprehensive solution and to a suspension of  andultimately an end to  the sanctions  which arecausing great suffering among the Iraqi people.Another example of what the United Nationsmust do to right current wrongs is the complete liftingof the sanctions imposed on the Libyan ArabJamahiriya  which has fulfilled its obligations andsurrendered the wanted suspects.As we meet today  developing countries areexperiencing serious economic difficulties that arenegatively affecting their development in anenvironment of heavy foreign debt and decliningofficial development assistance. They are also facingrestrictions on their exports to world markets andunfair prices for their basic commodities. Africa'seconomic situation is still very serious  despite all theefforts of African countries and of the internationalcommunity to overcome that continent's developmentproblems. The economic situation is worsening  andforeign debt is increasing. Whatever economic gainsare achieved must therefore be spent on debt servicingand on correcting the imbalance resulting from thereverse flow of resources. Africa is also the continentthat is suffering most from HIV/AIDS.We support the efforts of the Secretary-General and we greatly value his initiatives to reform theUnited Nations. With regard to the reform programmeproposed in 1997 and approved by the GeneralAssembly  we note with concern that its developmentgoals have yet to be achieved. We have witnessed a30continuous decline in financing that has led to thereduction of development programmes. We believe thatthe Organization's socio-economic developmentactivities must be given highest priority  in accordancewith the principles and purposes of the Charter.Without development  there will no lasting peace orsecurity.The Millennium Declaration set out manyobjectives  including that of achieving sustainableeconomic development and  in particular  sustainablehuman development  with human beings as its crucialelement. Accordingly  human development is the majortopic of the high-level segment of the Economic andSocial Council's  current substantive session. TheMillennium Declaration objectives of eradicatingpoverty  achieving economic development  halting thespread of HIV/AIDS and bringing that disease undercontrol by 2015 all require our concerted effort andpolitical will. In addition  the voluntary contributionsand direct financial investment flows of local andinternational donors are required to achieve theobjectives of the Monterrey Conference  the mostimportant of which is the commitment by richindustrialized countries of 0.7 per cent of their grossnational product to official development assistance.Those countries made the same commitment atprevious conferences. Here  I must mention the DohaConference in the light of the importance it attached tofree trade  market liberalization and infrastructureexpansion in increasing the competitive ability ofdeveloping countries  in particular African countries.That Conference also emphasized the importance of thetransfer of information and communicationstechnology  economic diversity  foreign trade andincreased market access  as well as increasing flows offoreign resources and reducing debt.Qatar has always opposed coercive  unilateralsanctions imposed by one single country on anothersovereign country over which it has no legaljurisdiction. We believe that imposing sanctions onother countries with a view to serving economicinterests or achieving political objectives represents aviolation of the principles of equal sovereignty amongstates and self-determination  as provided for by theCharter of the United Nations and relevant UnitedNations resolutions. Therefore  Qatar reaffirms itscategorical rejection of all attempts to implement locallaws across borders on the citizens and companies ofother States to force those countries to comply withunilateral economic measures that transcend the legaljurisdiction of States. That is in direct violation ofinternational law  of the provisions of the Charter andof the rules of the World Trade Organization.The President: We have heard the last speaker inthe general debate for this meeting."
"144",5920,"ROU",57,2002,"﻿Allowme to begin  Sir  by congratulating you on yourelection to preside over the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. My congratulations go likewise tothe outgoing president  His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his dedication and for a job well done. I wishalso to echo earlier speakers in welcoming  verywarmly  Switzerland as the newest Member of theOrganization and Timor-Leste  which will be joining usshortly.Global security models  which are in a process ofchange after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 have posed serious and unexpected challenges to theinternational community. We have been faced withtragic proof that our security is more fragile than wehad imagined and that democracy and freedom havebeen under attack. We have been violently remindedthat combating terrorism is a matter for us all.The prompt and constructive response of mycountry  Romania  to the United Nations appeal forsolidarity has been very clear. Our participation in theInternational Assistance Force for Afghanistan approved by the Romanian Parliament in December2001  clearly attests to our resolve to fulfil  in practiceas well as in spirit  our commitment to the principlesand purposes of the United Nations.Following the adoption by the Security Councilof its resolution 1373 (2001)  we enacted legislation toprevent  in Romania  the financing of terroristorganizations and acts  and we have ratified the 12United Nations conventions and protocols concerningterrorism.We have been actively involved in operations inAfghanistan with our strategic allies and we are together  tackling the consequences of the struggleagainst terrorism.(spoke in English)But have we  the international community  doneenough? The Secretary-General  in his opening14statement  drew an uncompromising picture of thethreats to peace  and rightly reminded us of ourresponsibilities.Romania believes it is necessary to proceedunambiguously in condemning and actively combatingall forms of terrorism and violent fanaticism throughcooperation at the international level that issubstantive  consistent and coherent. The financing ofterrorism is an obvious target for action. Romaniabelieves that the experience of regional liaison andjoint operations in South-East Europe can be of use tointernational efforts to suppress the flow of funds toterrorist groups.The terrorist threat calls for us to be even morevigilant in controlling the use and proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  as well as conventionalweapons  such as landmines and small arms  which canfall — sometimes too often — into the wrong hands. Inthis context  Romania calls on Iraq to comply withexisting Security Council resolutions and to allowUnited Nations inspectors to return  immediately andunconditionally  to enable further decisions to be takenrelevant to the people of Iraq and the security andstability of the area. Romania was on the SecurityCouncil in 1990 when the first resolutions on Iraq wereadopted and contributed to building consensus at thattime. We believe that the Security Council mustrespond to the continued defiance of its resolutionsfirmly and resolutely. There can be no doubt as to myGovernment's stand should fears about possible threatsto global security prove justified. As we have done inthe past  we will stand alongside our allies andfreedom-loving nations in the defence of world peace.A strong response to Iraq's long-term defiance ofthe Security Council's authority is also called forbecause of the threat to global security from weaponsof mass destruction. The temptation to apply thesesame principles to other  localized conflict situationsshould be resisted  especially when mechanisms existfor dialogue and peaceful resolution. While States havethe right to exercise control over their own security they also have a responsibility to ensure that securitymeasures do not undermine the foundations ofdemocracy. We can adapt to these new realities withoutsacrificing human rights and universal values. Indeed through respect for civil liberties and the promotion ofequal opportunity and social cohesion  we can help toremove some of the root causes of terrorism:resentment and frustration fuelled by poverty andmarginalization.This is a fundamental element of conflictprevention  but early warning and early intervention bythe international community are not enough. Theexperiences of the last decade show that it is time tomove away from ad hoc solutions for short-termproblems towards an integrated and long-termapproach to nation-building. By “integrated”  I meanthat the international response should be based on anefficient division of labour between the appropriateorganizations  with a common mandate and a clearchain of command. By “long-term”  I mean thatinternational support should remain in place untilsecurity is seen to be durable and rehabilitation andlocal empowerment have become a reality.The stabilization and rehabilitation process inAfghanistan is a test for the changing pattern ofinternational cooperation. Ultimately  reconstructionefforts must be directed towards sustainability andownership by the Afghan people. The recent attempt onPresident Karzai's life demonstrates the frailty of thecurrent situation in Afghanistan. This and the attacks inKabul and other cities are dramatic reminders of theprice paid by too many Afghan generations forrecovering their sovereignty and for winning the rightto govern their country.The intense effort that the United Nations hasembarked upon in the democratic and physicalreconstruction of the country is commendable.Romania believes that this commitment must bemaintained as long as the dangers of a serious renewalof violence exist. Romania has already made a solidfinancial contribution to the international aid effort andis ready to offer further assistance  according to therequirements of the Afghan Government.But efforts to aid Afghanistan should not stop atthat country's borders. Stability for that country and theregion will be assured only through a broader visionfor the development of the whole of Central Asia. Weneed to find a way to link Europe and Central Asia byworking up an integrated strategy that will reinforcedemocracy and bring economic prosperity not onlyacross Europe  but to Eurasia as well. A first step mustbe to put an end to the “frozen conflicts” in EasternEurope and the Caucasus.The positive developments in South-East Europeshow what can be achieved when the international15community takes action in a coherent and coordinatedway. The United Nations and its international partners notably the European Union  the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization  have worked tirelessly tohelp to reconstitute societies based on the rule of lawand ethnic tolerance  but the process is not yetcomplete. It is vital that this decisive electoral autumnshow beyond doubt that modern democracy has takenroot in the western Balkans. By ensuring free and fairelections  political leaders in the region should keeptheir countries on the right path to Europeanintegration. As Romania draws closer to achieving itsEuro-Atlantic integration ambitions  we will continueto contribute actively to efforts to break down theremaining divisions in South-East Europe and to speedup the integration of the whole region into theEuropean mainstream.The violent conflicts over the last decade awokethe world to the need for action against the horror ofwar crimes. The entry into force on 1 July of theInternational Criminal Court Statute represents a verysignificant step forward. Romania ratified theInternational Criminal Court Statute this year andremains deeply committed to ensuring that the Courtfunction effectively as a viable and necessaryinstrument of international law. In this spirit  weencourage ongoing discussions  which should clarifysome of the outstanding issues.The danger that the violence in the Middle Eastwill escalate beyond control cannot be ignored. Myrecent discussions with political leaders from theregion have reinforced my conviction that it is crucialto find a way to renounce the logic of war in favour ofa logic of peace. We call on the parties to engage inserious negotiations for a peaceful  comprehensive andlasting solution. Their success or failure will haveconsequences far beyond their own immediate region impacting upon what might be termed the widerMiddle East  encompassing the entire region fromCentral Asia to North Africa.The two serious challenges for the twenty-firstcentury are fighting terrorism and new security threats on the one hand  and making globalization work foreveryone everywhere  on the other. In both  the UnitedNations has a decisively important role to play. Wehave reached the point where we must address theglobal agenda in a way that finally meets people'sexpectations and achieves early results. We mustdeliver in a coherent and pragmatic way on thecommitments taken at Doha  Monterrey andJohannesburg  as well as other major United Nationsconferences  such as the special session on children.We must design an urgent  clear and encouragingresponse to the humanitarian needs of Africa andpromote conditions for the sustainable development ofthe African continent.Tangible progress depends upon a new paradigmof cooperation between stakeholders of globalization States  corporations  international organizations and  ofcourse  civil society. Efficient implementation dependsupon a new architecture of global governance that isfitted to today's realities and a renewed sense ofresponsibility among all States. Finally  success inachieving the millennium development goals dependsupon a strict and verifiable system for monitoringimplementation. A new sense of participation andpartnership must energize our common contribution. Inthis respect  We welcome President Bush'sannouncement that the United States will rejoin theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization.The graduation of the Central European countriesfrom transition economies to membership of theEuropean Union in the few years to come is proof thatdemocracy with a functioning market economy and anopen society does work. But there is a price  and that isthe difficult decisions  politically and socially  ofsuccessful transition.We have been fortunate to have European Unionfinancial support and know-how  which have been vitalin maintaining the momentum and the publicacceptance of sometimes painful reform programmes.In return  we will do the same by sharing the burden ofinternational responsibility and assistance. We have notonly a moral and historic  but also a strategic responsibility to address the needs of the poor anddisadvantaged in our region and beyond. Discontentand disillusionment breed instability  which in turngives terrorism fertile conditions in which to flourish.Governments  business and civil society have aunique opportunity to accelerate economicdevelopment through the use of the powerful newinformation and communication technologies. Inpreparation for the forthcoming World Summit on theInformation Society  to be held at Geneva in 2003 andat Tunis in 2005  Romania will host  from 7 to 916November this year  a regional conference at theministerial level organized jointly with theInternational Telecommunication Union and theEconomic Commission for Europe. Our aim is to drawup a preliminary plan of action with specificmechanisms for bridging the digital divide.The Security Council is the linchpin of the UnitedNations. Romania believes that we must redouble ourefforts to promote reform of that body. Thecomposition of the Council should be morerepresentative of our global membership and shouldreflect more accurately the realities of the globalbalance of power today. Romania's candidature for aCouncil seat in 2004-2005 is motivated by our deepcommitment to the United Nations as a credible andefficient contributor to peace and stability around theworld.What will we take home from this session? Weneed to reflect on how to eliminate the habit of ad hoccooperation. We need to think creatively and to craftcontinuous patterns of teamwork  and we should bemore receptive to what people want from the UnitedNations. That is how we can best live up to ourcommitments and overcome what is seen as thehandicap of international organizations: thediscrepancy between words and deeds. Let us leave thissession determined to work on mapping out pledgesand achievements in a way that will add vigour to ourwords and reinforce our credibility. That  after all  isthe source of our unique strength."
"145",5966,"RUS",57,2002,"﻿One year has passed since the tragic eventsthat took place on 11 September 2001 in the UnitedStates of America shook the world and demonstratedthe magnitude and brutality of the global threat ofinternational terrorism. During the past year the worldbecame fully aware of the challenges that humankindwas facing as we entered the twenty-first century. Itwas a year during which the international communitycame together and began to take decisive action againstterrorism.While paying tribute to the memory of all of thevictims of the terrorism that has left a bloody trailthroughout the world  we must now take stock of theinitial results of the joint anti-terrorist campaign and most important  outline our objectives in strengtheningthe foundations of international security and stability.The most important outcome of the comingtogether of States to achieve common goals unprecedented since the Second World War  is cleartoday. A broad international anti-terrorist coalition hasbeen established and is actively functioning; it hasalready demonstrated its effectiveness in Afghanistan a country that international terrorists of variousaffiliations had transformed into their own personallair. Our common objective is not only to preserve theexperience of interaction acquired within theframework of the coalition  avoiding such unilateralactions as might undermine it  but also to transformthe anti-terrorist alliance into a supportive mechanismof effective security and cooperation for the newmillennium.The United Nations must certainly be a pivotalelement of such a mechanism. Indeed  the UnitedNations is called upon to continue to guarantee that  incombating new threats and challenges  the efforts of20the international community rest on a solid basis ofinternational law.We must acknowledge  and the past year hasbeen very instructive in this regard  that a great dealof hard work awaits us. It will be possible to putinsurmountable obstacles in the way of fanatics andextremists who spread death and destruction only if wecan reach general agreement on core issues relating tothe world order. In this context  the role of the UnitedNations is  indeed  irreplaceable.The fact that the process of implementing thefundamental anti-terrorist resolution  SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  is under way is ofcritical importance. That resolution is binding on allStates  and we must now seek to achieve itsunconditional implementation by all States.A priority task in the war on terrorism is thestrengthening of its international legal framework. Firstand foremost  there is a need to ensure the genuinelyuniversal character of existing anti-terroristconventions.Having ratified the 1999 Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism  Russia isnow completing the process of accession to thoseinternational instruments. At the same time  we areseriously concerned about the lack of real progress innegotiating a comprehensive convention on combatingterrorism and a convention on the suppression of actsof nuclear terrorism.The well-known differences in the approaches ofStates to the provisions of such instruments couldcertainly be fully reconciled. They should notovershadow the objective  which is pressing for all ofus  of establishing a legal basis to counter terrorism inall its manifestations  a basis that would be inkeeping with the realities of today's world. Russia iscontinuing to make resolute efforts to achieve thatobjective.It is the obligation of all States to protect therights and freedoms of their citizens  the mostimportant of these being the right to life. But it isprecisely the lives of ordinary people that arethreatened by terrorists  and each year new names areadded to the list of victims. The internationalcommunity can no longer tolerate this. It is ourobligation to provide our citizens with the right toreliable protection against terrorism.Such an objective can be achieved only if allStates agree on a range of specific measures underUnited Nations auspices. There is now a need to drawup an effective code to protect human rights againstterrorism. Some of these measures have already beendiscussed by the international community  including inthis forum. Others will require consideration in abroader context. The most important consideration however  is that we should agree on a unified system ofvalues and measures shared by all States.The results of the war against terrorism will betangible only if we act in concert at all levels  global regional and national. The anti-terrorist cooperationmechanisms aimed at preventing the spread ofterrorism in Central Asia  including those within theframework of the Commonwealth of IndependentStates and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  aregaining momentum and thus provide clear evidence ofthat fact. There is a great deal of potential in the newpartnership between Russia and the countries of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization.The field of anti-terrorism is an integral part ofour continuous dialogue and cooperation with theleading countries of the world  including the UnitedStates  China  India and the States members of theEuropean Union. We are confident that thedevelopment of such interaction at many levels willpromote a climate of confidence  security andcooperation in all parts of the world.The stability and credibility of the emerginginternational system of the twenty-first century willdepend directly on the maintenance and strengtheningof strategic stability. This fundamental objective wasadvanced by the signing  by the Presidents of Russiaand of the United States  at their May meeting inMoscow  of the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty which was a specific  major contribution by the leadingnuclear Powers to nuclear disarmament.It is also very important to ensure the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Thedanger of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons ortheir components falling into the irresponsible hands ofterrorists increases international terrorism's potential tocause devastation. This means that there is a need tostep up efforts to strengthen the non-proliferationregime for weapons of mass destruction and theirdelivery vehicles.21By acting jointly and responsibly  we havealready achieved a great deal. When we speak aboutthe establishment of new regimes for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and forarms control  we by no means wish to imply arenunciation of regimes and agreements already ineffect. They are our shared protective mechanism  amechanism that is very reliable and has stood the testof time. Unjustified removal of the key elements of theinternational legal framework of non-proliferation canaggravate the international military and strategicsituation and undermine global security.Furthermore  we should universalize' the mostimportant agreements on non-proliferation of nuclearweapons and on comprehensive nuclear test ban. Themissile sphere needs a sustainable negotiating processaimed at concluding an international arrangement on aglobal regime of missile and missile technology non-proliferation.The prevention of the deployment of weapons inouter space forms an integral part of the non-proliferation process. Together with a number of ourpartners we suggest that a comprehensive agreement beworked out aimed at preserving outer space as a zonefree from any kind of weapons. We are confident thatthis proposal serves the interests of all States  andexpect that it will enjoy wide support.Since its establishment  the United Nations hasbeen engaged in the settlement of regional conflicts.Those so-called local problems have long turned intoone of the main threats to international stability.Terrorism  political extremism  and economic andsocial degradation are their customary companions.Certainly  the primary responsibility in any settlementrests with the relevant parties  but multilateralmechanisms have also repeatedly demonstrated theireffectiveness in the restoration of peace and concord. Atangible progress made with the United Nations visibleinvolvement in the post-Taliban reconstruction ofAfghanistan is one of our common accomplishments.We can add to this the adoption by the United NationsSecurity Council of major practical decisions insupport of a comprehensive settlement in the MiddleEast and the resolution of crises in a number of Africancountries.And yet  we are still far from a radical decrease inthe number and intensity of armed conflicts. Hardwork  requiring great human as well as material andfinancial resources  is awaiting us. But the mostimportant here is the presence of a strong political willto implement the provisions of the United NationsCharter pertaining to the peaceful settlement ofdisputes.Experience shows that no matter how complexinternational crises and conflicts may be  whateverchallenges and threats they may be fraught with  theycan be settled with the aid of United Nationsinstruments and on the basis of international law. Thisfully applies to the situation around Iraq  which haslong required political settlement in strict compliancewith the Security Council resolutions.The entire international community benefits froma steady enhancement of the leading role of ourOrganization in peacemaking. We cannot relax ourattention to this task.At all times and throughout the world  terrorismand extremism have tried to justify themselves withcontinuous social and economic instability and poverty.While recognizing the existence of these seriousproblems we should state most resolutely that terrorismdoes not and will not have any justification. At thesame time  the creation of a sustainable and fair globalfinancial and economic structure would  certainly  helpcombat many dangerous challenges to mankind. Thelatest major international forums  the InternationalConference on Financing for Developmentin Monterey  World Food Summit in Rome World Summit on Sustainable Development inJohannesburg  adopted decisions designed to uprootthe causes of the most threatening disparities in theworld. The next step is to implement the agreementswe have reached.Equally sweeping are the tasks that face us in thefield of environmental protection. Natural disasters thatafflicted many regions of our planet this summer havedemonstrated again that the solution of environmentalissues cannot be put off unless we want to endanger thevery survival of future generations. This sphere alsodepends on multilateral efforts that exclude the egoismof individual States.The initiative of Russian President Vladimir V.Putin on holding in autumn 2003 a World Conferenceon Climate Change in Moscow is designed tocoordinate our efforts in this field.22A year ago  the Russian Federation called on theinternational community from the podium of theUnited Nations General Assembly to create a globalsystem of counteraction to present-day threats andchallenges that would be aimed at tackling real issuesin the sphere of security and at meeting the vitalinterests of each and every State. This system wouldprovide for long-term international stability andsustainable development.To be efficient  such a system needs a generallyrecognized coordinating centre capable of rallying theinternational community. And we do have such acentre  the United Nations with its uniquelegitimacy  universality and experience. Our commontask is to unite around the United Nations to provide itwith the necessary potential and resources and todevelop as much as possible its internal reserves.Today  we can state with satisfaction that theglobal system is already evolving and the beginning ofthis process is largely successful. We suggest that anadditional impetus should be given to this process anda resolution to encourage a most prompt creation of aglobal system of counteraction to present-day threatsand challenges should be adopted at this session of theGeneral Assembly. By doing so  we will direct allStates towards the joint elaboration of its general shapeand parameters. This is even more relevant becausesome of its parameters are already visible.It is apparent that the system to be created mustbe:ñ Global  as modern challenges in the context ofglobalization pose a universal threat  and shouldbe addressed at the global level.ñ Comprehensive in scope  as each of the modernthreats bears a huge destructive potential and allsuch problems without exceptions should beembraced by the system.ñ Holistic in approach  as quite often the newthreats and challenges are directly interrelated.ñ Universal in participation.Finally  the system should become a reflection ofthe international rule of law  as its power will be builton principles and regulations of international law  theUnited Nations Charter above all.We bear grave responsibility to futuregenerations  and the model of world order we willestablish is destined to influence the life on our planetfor decades. As for Russia  we have made our choice.This is the choice in favour of a democratic  multi-polar world order  which would guarantee sustainabledevelopment and equal security for all States; a worldorder formed on the basis of the extensive structure ofmultilateral institutions integrated within theframework of the United Nations.We hope that the decisions of this GeneralAssembly session will mark an important stage of thisprocess."
"146",6013,"RWA",57,2002,"﻿Allowme at the outset  on behalf of my delegation and on myown behalf to congratulate you wholeheartedly on yourelection as President of this session of the GeneralAssembly. As testimony to the esteem enjoyed by youand your country  Sir  you may rest assured of thesupport of the Rwanda delegation in carrying out yourtasks.I should like to take this opportunity to pay awell-deserved tribute to your predecessor for theeffective way in which he guided our work during thefifty-sixth session.I should also like  on behalf of my Government to express my gratitude and appreciation to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tirelessefforts to ensure the effective and transparentfunctioning of the United Nations and to promoteworld peace.The Government of Rwanda warmly welcomesthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste and the SwissConfederation to the United Nations. We are alreadyfamiliar with their contribution to the enhancement ofthe role of our great United Nations family  especiallytheir respect for the principles of equal rights and theright of peoples to self-determination.In this connection  the Government of Rwandaappeals for appropriate measures to be taken to ensurea fair and lasting settlement of the conflict in WesternSahara  in accordance with the purposes and principlesof the Organization. Furthermore  the Government ofRwanda reiterates its hope that peace will be achievedin the Middle East — a peace that guarantees thecreation of a secure Palestinian State with recognizedboundaries  coexisting peacefully with the State ofIsrael  whose security should also be guaranteed.I should like to recall that  with the collapse ofthe Berlin Wall and the end of the ideological war oftenreferred to as the cold war  the world entered a new era with a new economic order. Despite the existence ofhotbeds of violence in a number of areas on allcontinents  we welcome and encourage initiativesdesigned to resolve the tensions created during the coldwar. In that connection  the Rwandan Governmentencourages talks between North and South Korea. Wehope that the two parties will move forward towardsthe peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula. TheRwandan Government also supports the principle ofone China. The question of Taiwan is an internal matterfor China and can be effectively resolved out of thecontext of the ideological war that gave rise to it  inaccordance with the principle  already accepted by theChinese themselves  of one country and two systems.19This session of the General Assembly is beingheld one year after the terrible events of 11 September2001. The terrorist attack perpetrated against theUnited States remains deeply etched in the memory ofthe people of Rwanda  and I would like to reiterate oursolidarity with the American people. I do so with goodreason: perhaps I should recall that  since 1994 Rwanda has been living under the perpetual threat ofterrorist groups based in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  the most active of which is known as theArmy for the Liberation of Rwanda (ALIR)  anorganization made up of elements of the formerRwandan Army (ex-FAR) forces and Interahamwemilitias that were responsible for the 1994 genocide.The leaders of ALIR were among those who plannedand carried out the genocide in Rwanda. Since 1994such elements have attacked Rwanda on manyoccasions  carrying out the targeted killing of innocentpeople and destroying social and economicinfrastructure of national and internationalsignificance. It was such elements that savagelymassacred American  British and New Zealand touristsin the Bwindi park in March 1999.Now  in an attempt to mislead international publicopinion and escape justice  the members of thisterrorist group are endeavouring to organize themselvesinto political groups using a number of different labels.The Government of Rwanda therefore appeals to theUnited Nations and its Member States to take thenecessary measures to track down and arrest all thoseresponsible for the Rwanda genocide who are nowmembers of ALIR and to bring them to internationaljustice. We also appeal to the United Nations and itsMember States to formally condemn those countriesthat finance  harbour or lend moral  material orlogistical support to the ALIR terrorist organization.With regard to the prosecution of those accusedof the Rwandan genocide  I reiterate the appeal of theRwandan Government to the international communityto ensure the effectiveness and credibility of theInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda so that itcan truly fulfil the expectations of the people ofRwanda and all justice-loving people. In thisconnection  special attention should be paid to therecommendations on this subject submitted by myGovernment to the Security Council. Furthermore  thetime has come for the international community toensure the implementation of the relevantrecommendations of the report on the Rwandagenocide that was drafted under United Nationsauspices  known as the Carlsson report.With regard to the destabilizing effects of theterrorist activities of ALIR  I should like to advocate asa remedy that support be given to the Lusaka andPretoria Agreements  which are designed to restorepeace in the Great Lakes region. Those twoAgreements provide for the disarmament demobilization  reintegration and repatriation of whatare known as the negative forces that are operating inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  which includeex-FAR forces and Interahamwe. The RwandanGovernment appeals as a matter of urgency to theUnited Nations and its Member States to spare noeffort in strongly supporting the implementation ofthose Agreements.As for Rwanda  it has done its utmost toimplement those Agreements and to work tore-establish a genuine and lasting peace in the GreatLakes region. In accordance with the statement madeby Paul Kagame  President of the Rwandese Republic on 13 September during a meeting of the SecurityCouncil on the question of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  I would like to take this opportunity toannounce that  on 17 September  my Governmentbegan to withdraw its troops from the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  in conformity with theprovisions of the Pretoria Accord.My Government is convinced that theimplementation of those Agreements will lead us notonly to the restoration of security and stability in oursubregion  but also to the establishment of a climate ofconfidence and good cooperative relations that willfacilitate common actions in our struggle against theterrorist activities orchestrated by ALIR or by anyother terrorist organization.In this connection  I would like reaffirm thecommitment of the Government of Rwanda tocooperate fully to achieve the success of any initiativedesigned to prevent and repress terrorism in all itsforms. In this connection  and in implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001)  ourGovernment has now ratified all the variousinternational instruments to combat terrorism that wehad not signed or ratified previously  in addition to theOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Convention on20the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism  which wehad already ratified. Rwanda has just submitted its firstreport to the Security Council Committee established tofollow up the implementation of that resolution.Rwanda is resolutely determined to combat terrorism source of desolation and instability for the internationalcommunity. We believe that the internationalcommunity should mobilize all of its means to fightand to put an end to poverty  which affects so much ofour population. It should do more for the eradication ofinjustice and inequality in order to ensure a betterworld for future generations. Thus  we call for thestrengthening of the United Nations and the entireUnited Nations system to ensure the implementation ofall of the international commitments to help poorcountries. Commitments  such as those expressed in theMillennium Declaration  in the Monterrey Consensusand at the Johannesburg Summit on SustainableDevelopment  should be reflected in concrete actionswithout delay. Third-world countries  especiallycountries of Africa  set great store by this.In Africa  we would like to root out the causes ofpoverty. We have already grasped the different aspectsof the situation and decided upon a framework to guideus in this long struggle against poverty  namely theNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).Within NEPAD  we have pledged to put an end tofratricidal wars that devastate our already moribundeconomies. We have pledged also to work towardsdemocracy  good governance  and for letting the rule oflaw prevail.The international community is hereby calledupon to assist us in this process. We ask each of therich countries to reexamine its positions regarding theterms that are often linked to various interventionsaimed at helping poor countries  particularly as regardsthe debt and official development assistance (ODA).This needs to be done in order to enable these countriesto confront effectively the various scourges thatthreaten them  including famine  pandemic diseases HIV/AIDS  malaria  and so forth  so that they caneventually catch up with the rich countries. Hence globalization will become profitable for the whole ofmankind."
"147",6056,"SAU",57,2002,"﻿I have the honour to deliver the statement of theGovernment of Saudi Arabia on behalf of His RoyalHighness the Minister for Foreign Affairs.It gives me great pleasure at the outset of thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly toconvey to Mr. Kavan personally and to his friendlycountry  the Czech Republic  our sincerestcongratulations on his election to the importantposition of President of the Assembly. We areconfident that he will preside with great skill andefficiency over our deliberations.I wish to take this opportunity to express ourgratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  whopresided over the last session with wisdom andexperience and deserves our gratitude and appreciation.I also wish to take this opportunity to express ourthanks and appreciation to Secretary-General KofiAnnan for his tireless efforts to achieve peace andconsolidate security throughout the world and for hispersistent efforts to strengthen the Organization's roleand enhance its efficiency.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that therecent admission of Switzerland to membership of thisOrganization will enrich the United Nations andundoubtedly enhance its role  given that country'sremarkable contributions to and experience ininternational cooperation.Our current session coincides with the firstanniversary of the horrendous disaster that befell theUnited States of America as a result of a mostdespicable act of terrorism that led to the death ofthousands of innocent lives  with enormous materiallosses and immeasurable harm from which we are allstill suffering. The pain and suffering of the Americanpeople over the loss of their relatives and loved ones asa result of this cowardly act was our loss  too  as wewitnessed those events in a state of total shock anddismay. We felt nothing but absolute condemnation forthose who committed that utterly criminal and barbaricact.I therefore convey our sincerest condolences andheartfelt sympathies to the President of the UnitedStates  to the families of the victims and to theAmerican people. I assure them that this horribleexperience can only strengthen what we already knowabout the inner strength and pride of the Americanpeople. Those feelings of fortitude and resolve  as wellas their determination to confront this challenge and tomove on with resolve  guided by the principles andvalues of the founding fathers of their great nation were unmistakable when we  along with the American23people and President  commemorated the firstanniversary of the tragedy.It was most overwhelmingly painful for us to seea number of our young people  who were in a positionto contribute beneficially to the development and well-being of their own country  fall victim to those who ledthem astray as they embarked on a road that endedtragically. Those young men committed a grave offenseagainst their country and their religion  which totallyand utterly forbids the crime they committed.May I be permitted here to quote from the lettersent to United States President George W. Bush by HisRoyal Highness Crown Prince Abdullah  in describingthose young men in a most unambiguous andmeaningful manner:“We in Saudi Arabia felt especially acute pain atthe realization that a number of young Saudicitizens had been enticed and deluded and theirreasoning subverted to the degree of denying thetolerance that their religion embraced and turningtheir backs on their homeland  which has alwaysstood for understanding and moderation. Theyallowed themselves to be used as a tool to dogreat damage to Islam  a religion they espoused and to all Muslims.“I would like to make it very clear that realMuslims throughout the world will never allow aminority of defiant extremists to speak in thename of Islam and distort its spirit of tolerance.“Your friends in the Kingdom of SaudiArabia denounced and condemned the attacks of11 September as strongly as the American peopledid. Like them  we are convinced that nothing canever justify the shedding of innocent blood or thetaking of lives and the terrorizing of people regardless of cause or motive. Therefore  we donot simply reiterate our sincere condolences tothe victims' relatives; we also assure all of ourcontinued will and determination to do all we canto combat that malignant evil and uproot it fromour world. My country will maintain its firmresolve to combat terrorism unilaterally andjointly with the international coalition. We shallpursue the war against terrorism relentlessly. Ourdrive emanates from our firm conviction thatterrorism is a pernicious disease that poses alethal threat to every human society and everyeffort must be made to confront and defeat it.”Saudi Arabia's position regarding terrorism hasalways been very clear  dispassionate and responsible.That is logical since our country was honoured by Godto be the custodian of the Muslims' holiest sites  and itis also the birthplace of the heavenly message of Islam.Thus  we want to uphold the principles and teachingsof the Islamic faith.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms its totalsupport for all Security Council resolutions related tothe question of terrorism. It has been cooperating fullywith the international community in implementingthose resolutions  with the aim of combating terrorism.Moreover  Saudi Arabia has taken the necessary stepsto close any gaps in regulations related to charitablefundraising that might be exploited for illegalpurposes.The competent authorities in Saudi Arabia haveput in place all the necessary measures to implementSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). Moreover  theGovernment of Saudi Arabia has lent its support toevery international effort  within the framework of theSecurity Council  to crack down on terrorism by allmeans approved by the international community.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  which has itselfsuffered from terrorist acts  has enacted regulations thatmete out punishment to the perpetrators of terroristacts. Moreover  it has made the fight against terrorismpart of its basic school curricula.At the regional level  Saudi Arabia was one of thefirst countries to sign the Pan-Arab Convention for theSuppression of Terrorism  adopted by the League ofArab States in 1998  and it is also a signatory to theConvention of the Organization of the IslamicConference on Combating International Terrorism.At the international level  Saudi Arabia is a partyto 10 conventions and agreements that deal withvarious forms of terrorism. We sincerely look to theUnited Nations  which represents all countries of theworld  to make the international effort to combatterrorism a truly global one  without bias ordiscrimination  with the primary goal of serving allmembers of the international community and protectingthem from the evils of terrorism  including State-supported terrorism.Confronting terrorism  international cooperationin tracking down terrorist organizations and theexploration of all ways and means to eradicate it24represent important steps towards eliminating thatdangerous phenomenon. However  the internationaleffort against terrorism  regardless of its effectiveness will not be capable of totally eradicating thatphenomenon unless it addresses its underlying causes including political  economic and social circumstancesthat become ground for extremism  violence andterrorism.The decision to eradicate terrorism has beentaken  without hesitation or vacillation. However  if ourtrue objective is to eradicate the possibility of itsrecurrence  then attention must be paid to the political economic and social conditions that  in many instances create grounds for extremism  especially when thoseconditions reach serious proportions and the possibilityfor peaceful change and development does not exist.For example  the deteriorating conditions ofoppressed people  whether they suffer injustice andoppression or are subject to foreign occupation  and theinternational community's inability  for one reason oranother  to find just solutions to those problems willultimately lead to a situation in which opportunity iscreated for people with evil intentions to takeadvantage of naïve young men who are led to believethat violence and terrorism are the only and idealmeans for correcting the injustice that afflict them.Thirty-five years have passed since thePalestinian people came under the suffocating Israelioccupation. The cycle of violence in the occupiedPalestinian territories will never end unless thelegitimate rights of the Palestinians are respected.Those rights have been acknowledged by theinternational community as a whole and are enshrinedin many United Nations resolutions and have becomelegally binding through various internationalagreements signed by consecutive Israeli Governmentswith the Palestinian side.The obligations contained in those agreementshave been completely ignored by the Israelis  whetherthey relate to the continuation of the occupation or thetreatment of the Palestinian people and their legitimateleadership.The policy of siege  starvation  militaryincursions  the destruction of property and thedesecration of holy places totally contravenes not onlysigned agreements  but also international law andhumanitarian norms.Furthermore  the Government of Ariel Sharon ismarginalizing the Palestinian Authority  establishedunder the Oslo Accords  isolating the Palestinianterritories and destroying their infrastructure. Inaddition  with nothing left to destroy  recently Sharonhas implemented a policy not only of imprisoning  butalso of assassinating  members of the Palestinianleadership. He recently and blatantly declared thatIsrael is no longer bound by any agreement signed withthe Palestinians  including the Oslo Accords.The situation in the occupied Palestinianterritories will undoubtedly lead to a humanitariandisaster resulting from the economic siege  theunchecked spread of disease and the virtual collapse ofpublic health and security forces.The most important fact to be recalled by all particularly the Israeli people  is that the goal ofsecurity promised by the current Israeli Governmentwill never materialize. That is due directly to thepolicies and practices of that Government  which choseto ignore dialogue and negotiations and opted foroppression and violence as a means of resolving thePalestinian problem.President Bush's statement to the Assemblyconcerning the difficulty of attaining peace between thePalestinians and Israelis  without providing thefreedom necessary for both  conforms with the currentsituation in the occupied territories  which continue toface a cycle of violence and suffering because one side namely the Palestinians  has been denied its right tofreedom and independence.Therefore  the exit point of that dilemma isIsrael's acknowledgement of the importance of theexistence of a Palestinian State established on a basisof constitutional legality and capable of conductingnegotiations and resolving pending problems thatcannot be ignored or bypassed. That is the action thatmust be taken if we truly intend to put an end to thecrisis in the occupied territories  the price of which isbeing paid by both Palestinians and Israelis.We believe that an independent Palestinian State based on a constitution binding on all Palestinians  andspecifying the basis and rules governing their relationswith Israel  will ultimately constitute a guarantee notonly for the Palestinians  but also for the Israelisthemselves  because the Israeli side will have theassurance of dealing with a legitimate entity with clearcharacteristics  structures and institutions. Their future25relations will determine their responsibilities. Toachieve this goal  the international community mustmove to end the humanitarian catastrophe and sufferingfaced by the Palestinian people.There is also a dire need to halt the violenceraging in the area through a practical and dispassionatetreatment of the security situation. That clearly meansthat the international community must hold the IsraeliGovernment accountable to the same level of securityobligations that is required of the Palestinian Authority.To limit the security obligations to the Palestinian sidealone is neither practical nor a means of solving theproblem. It is incumbent on all of us to work togetherto alleviate the suffering of the Palestinians and to takethe necessary practical steps to put the Palestinianproblem on the path to the desired settlement.As far as the comprehensive settlement of theArab-Israeli conflict is concerned  we see in the Arabpeace initiative adopted at the Beirut Arab Summit ahistoric move that contains all the requirements for ajust and permanent peace in the Middle East based onresolutions of international legitimacy and supportedby all Arab States. It would lead to Israel's fullwithdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and tonormalization of Arab relations with Israel.There is another problem that has reached crisisproportions and has become a source of grave dangerto the security and stability of the Middle East: theissue of Iraq and its implementation of the relevantSecurity Council resolutions. President Bushmentioned in his speech before the General Assemblythe need to refer this matter to the Security Council inorder to have the appropriate resolutions adopted. Thatrepresents a new and positive approach that we viewwith satisfaction. Without a doubt  that step has led to anew climate  resulting in the decision of the IraqiGovernment to allow the unconditional return ofUnited Nations weapons inspectors. That development which will avert confrontation through diplomaticmeans  shows that a positive step will  in most cases lead to a reciprocal positive step. At this point  it isappropriate to express our satisfaction with the IraqiGovernment's prompt response to the call of theministerial committee of the League of Arab States which met in parallel with the General Assembly. Webelieve that it is now the Security Council'sresponsibility to undertake serious efforts to alleviatethe suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq. We alsobelieve that it is now the responsibility of Iraq topromptly carry out its pledges to allow the return of theUnited Nations weapon inspection teams without priorconditions.The world has suffered great destruction andhuman misery during the last century  which wascharacterized by bloody confrontations  hate  conflictsand violence. In a world of intertwined dependenciesand common interests  the peace and stability ofhumankind depend largely upon the internationalcommunity's determination to forsake wars  renounceviolence  combat terrorism and settle disputes bypeaceful means and through the promotion of a cultureof peace and dialogue  as well as by consolidatinginternational cooperation  tolerance and understanding.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia calls for theestablishment of an international humanitarian orderbased on a new form of partnership between thedeveloped and developing countries  on a solid basis ofcooperation  solidarity and international economicrelations built on justice  equality  mutual benefits andjoint responsibilities.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia looks forward to atwenty-first century governed by the rule of law andnot by brutal force  a century of true pluralism in whicheveryone will participate in managing the affairs of thepresent and in creating the future  instead of excludingand ignoring others. We look forward to a year inwhich the moral values that govern human behaviourwill prevail and in which the banners of justice  mercyand interaction among peoples will be raised in orderto achieve security  stability and peace for all humanity."
"148",6095,"SDN",57,2002,"﻿At theoutset  I should like to express my sincere4congratulations  Mr. President  on your election topreside over the fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly. We are fully confident that your renowneddiplomatic experience will lead to the success of thisimportant session's deliberations and to the adoption ofresolutions and recommendations that are proportionateto the current international challenges. I should beremiss if I failed to express my appreciation to yourpredecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his tireless effortsto revitalize the role of the General Assembly. I shouldalso like to express  on behalf of the people and theGovernment of the Sudan  sincere congratulations tothe people and the Government of Switzerland on itsaccession to the Organization. In addition  I wish totake this opportunity to congratulate  on behalf of thepeople and the Government of the Sudan  the State ofEast Timor on its coming admission as a Member ofthe United Nations.A full year has passed since the deplorableterrorist events of 11 September  which terrified thiscity  site of the Organization's Headquarters  where theflags of all our countries fly and where we meet todeliberate on peace  security and justice. Theanniversary of the World Trade Center tragedy is anoccasion to strengthen international solidarity andresolve to combat terrorism  prompting us to reaffirmour conviction that terrorism is an elusive enemy thatknows no religion  ethnicity or homeland. It is achallenge that should be met with a collectiveinternational effort. The war on terrorism should bewaged with close national  regional and internationalcooperation and coordination  in conformity with theprinciples of international law and under the umbrellaof the United Nations.The Sudan  while reiterating its commitment to participation in and support for the internationalcampaign against terrorism  would like to draw theattention of the international community to the feelingsof anxiety expressed in various parts of the world at thederailment of the campaign  whose path and objectivesare no longer on target  and at its manipulation by theforces of extremism and advocates of confrontationamong civilizations and cultures.The situation in the Arab and Islamic world ingeneral  and in the Middle East in particular  reflectsthat anxiety and those feelings. Therefore  we in theSudan  current Chair of the Organization of the IslamicConference  reaffirm our rejection and denunciation ofthat derailment and urge that the internationalcampaign against terrorism comply with the rules ofinternational law. We strongly support the call of HisExcellency Mr. Hosni Mubarak  President of Egypt  forthe convening of an international conference onterrorism.The report of the Secretary-General on the workof the Organization  submitted to the current session reflects the desire of the world's countries to strengthencooperation  to alleviate poverty  to eliminate the debtburden and to resolve conflicts in order to create aworld of justice and equality  free of grievances injustice  hatred  bigotry  double standards conspiracies and politicization  which run counter tothe noble objectives of protecting and enhancinghuman rights. Sudan reaffirms its firm conviction thatthe United Nations remains the ideal mechanism forachieving international cooperation. Therefore  Sudanreaffirms its readiness to cooperate fully in all areaswith United Nations organs. Based on its conviction Sudan calls for the revitalization of all United Nationsorgans and urges that top priority be accorded theSecurity Council and the General Assembly in thatregard.During the past year  Sudan's relations with theUnited Nations made great progress  a progresscrowned by the important and successful visit ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan to Khartoum. The visitwas a good opportunity for him to see our country'spositive development in all fields. The visitstrengthened the cooperation between the Sudan andthe international Organization. This year has also seenvisits to the Sudan by the Directors-General of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  theUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization(UNIDO)  the Organization for the Prohibition ofChemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World IntellectualProperty Organization (WIPO). The Sudan ismaintaining good channels of communication andcoordination with the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies through cooperation  on the basisof the fundamental principles of its foreign policy including the principle of openness at the regional andinternational levels  and in consonance with its strongcommitment to active participation in all activitiesaimed at carrying out the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter.The United Nations Charter calls for theimportant peaceful resolution of disputes andemphasizes the important role of regional organizations5therein. The Sudan is currently presiding over tworegional organizations  the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development (IGAD) and theOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). In somecountries of these two organizations there are conflictsthat are the subject of much thought in the world today.IGAD is endeavouring to resolve the conflicts inSomalia and the Sudan. Through the OIC  whosemembership includes Pakistan  Iraq  Palestine andBosnia and Herzegovina  among 57 other countriesforming almost one third of the General Assembly  weare sparing no effort to find solutions to seriousconflicts at the national and regional levels.Without resolving the root causes of the Arab-Israeli conflict  by ending the occupation implementing lawful international resolutions restoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people including its right to establish an independent statewith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital  peace  securityand stability will not be achieved in this volatile regionof the world.We would like to stress the importance of apolitical settlement of the dispute between Iraq and theUnited Nations. In this regard  we would like to spareIraq and the region the risk of yet another war. AsChairman of the OIC  the Sudan has initiated contactswith the United Nations Secretary-General  the ForeignMinisters of the five permanent Security Councilmembers and the Foreign Minister of Iraq; these effortswere crowned with the unconditional acceptance byIraq of the return of the inspectors. We commend thebrave decision of the Iraqi leadership to allow thereturn of the United Nations inspectors and hope thatthis will lead to the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraqand the consolidation of its security  sovereignty andterritorial integrity so as to enable it to regain its activerole both regionally and internationally.The birth of the African Union last year was agreat African event  which renewed the aspirations andhopes of the continent for total liberation from thenightmare of conflict  poverty and underdevelopmentin order to achieve solidarity  unity  security andcomprehensive sustainable development there. We lookforward to working closely with the new internationalorganization  the African Union  through themechanisms established  such as its Peace and SecurityCouncil  so that we can coordinate the advancement ofour continent through effective bilateral cooperationbetween the countries and effective regionalcooperation with economic groupings and partnerships.In this connection  the New Partnership forAfrica's Development (NEPAD) has emerged astestimony to the ability of the continent to initiate andcoordinate initiatives among African countries. It alsoreflects the sincere desire of the continent forcooperation through this initiative  with its clearlystated socio-economic priorities. The various regionsof the continent have also determined their priorities inthe fields of infrastructure  energy  environment communications  education  health and primary care. Icall upon the international community to supportAfrica through this new partnership so that it will attainits aspirations. We also call on Africa to speak with onevoice regarding the follow-up and implementation ofNEPAD through the mechanisms of the African Union our collective organization.With regard to developments in my country  Ihave the honour to inform you of the latest endeavoursto resolve the conflict in southern Sudan. I would recallthat my Government has always considered the issue ofpeace and ending the war in the southern part of thecountry a priority and a strategic objective. This stemsfrom our conviction that national peace leads toregional peace  which in turn leads to internationalpeace  to which we all aspire. My country has sparedno effort to find a solution to the root causes of theconflict. To that end  we have organized nationalconferences and meetings  and we have also respondedpositively to the various regional and internationalefforts aimed at ending the conflict. Against thisbackground  and under the auspices of an IGADinitiative led by Kenya and the efforts ofintermediaries  the Government and the RebelMovement have signed on 20 July of this year theMachakos framework agreement. This agreement waswidely acknowledged as a step towards eventual peace supported both inside and outside the country.However  the rebel movement has set that progressback with its insistence on military activities and on re-opening issues already agreed upon during the firstround of talks. This regrettable development forced theGovernment to suspend the negotiations.My Government believes that it is meaningless tocontinue military activities after signing the peaceprotocol. My Government will continue to fulfil itsresponsibility for protecting our territorial integrity andnational security and for seeking solutions to the dire6humanitarian situation of our citizens affected by themilitary activities of the rebels  as well as itsresponsibility to secure peace and stability for allcitizens.While I am setting out the important political andconstitutional developments in my country  let mestress my Government's policy of consolidatingdemocracy and promoting human rights in Sudan particularly after the positive steps taken in the areas ofpolitical freedom and freedom of the press. This courseof action opened the door wide for the participation ofall our citizens at the national level.Sudan's foreign policy with regard tointernational and regional organizations has beenguided by a clear vision based on well-definedprinciples — namely  openness towards others effective participation in all international and regionalforums and constructive dialogue based on objectivityand transparency. Inspired by these positions ofprinciple  Sudan looks forward to playing aconstructive role on issues of regional cooperation inAfrica and among its neighbours. Sudan is wellqualified to play such a role because of its uniquegeopolitical situation and its human and naturalresources. With this policy  Sudan's relations with itsAfrican and Arab neighbours have witnessedsuccessful breakthroughs in economic cooperation mutual trade and strategic partnerships.The same applies to our interaction with theUnited States  which is now entering its third year. TheAmerican-Sudanese relationship has witnessed somepositive developments and our relations  which wereruptured  have progressed to the point where the UnitedStates is fully involved in efforts aimed at reaching apeaceful settlement in the Sudan.We are fully cognizant of the political andeconomic weight of the United States  as well as itseffective role in all regional and international issues.As such  we are keen to further enhance balancedrelations with the United States. Armed with faith inour just position with regard to the pending issuesbetween the two countries  we remain confident thatour relations with the United States will progress in thenear future and will be characterized by cooperation  aslong as both sides continue to remain committed to apolicy of dialogue rather than confrontation.We are also confident that an in-depth dialoguewill lead us to consolidate trust between the twocountries in a manner that will spare us the bitternessof the past. The unfortunate case of the Al-Shifapharmaceutical plant  which was falsely alleged toproduce chemical weapons  bears witness to thesignificance of such a confidence-building process.The end of the twentieth century witnessed manywars and conflicts that preoccupied the internationalcommunity. The negative impact of globalizationcontinues to widen the gap between the countries of theNorth and the South. Although considerable progresshas been achieved in international cooperation thanksto qualitative improvements at the United Nations andthe commendable role played by its Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  some issues and challenges continueto preoccupy the conscience of the internationalcommunity. For this reason the reform process of theUnited Nations  especially as regards the SecurityCouncil  remains imperative."
"149",6140,"SEN",57,2002,"﻿Mydelegation is particularly pleased to convey to Mr. JanKavan its heartfelt congratulations and fervent hopesfor success in the lofty and important task ahead ofhim. His well-deserved election to the presidency ofthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly is afitting tribute to the spirit of the Czech people as wellas to his outstanding intellectual and moral qualities.I am pleased to take this opportunity to say howmuch we appreciated the courtesy  the commitment andthe competence of his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo who guided our discussions in such an outstandingmanner. We express to him our sincere and deepgratitude for his many relevant initiatives  includingworking visits to West Africa  particularly to Senegal which are testimony of friendship for my country andsupport for the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD).I should like also like to express once again toSecretary-General Kofi Annan our admiration for hissteadfast determination in serving the ideals and causesof our Organization. Thanks to his wisdom and far-sightedness  the United Nations has found new vigourwith which to meet the tremendous challengesconfronting humankind.It is therefore fitting that our Organization which more than ever needs the widest support for itsplans and projects for a better management of theaffairs of our globalized world  is gaining two newMembers: Switzerland and  soon  East Timor. To thedelegations of those two friendly countries  I wouldlike to express Senegal's warmest congratulations andour conviction that their contribution will undoubtedlybe enriching for our Organization  whose universalcharacter will thereby be reinforced.It is precisely in the name of the principle of theuniversality of the United Nations that Senegalreiterates its fervent wish to see the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan join the concert of nations and assume itsfull responsibilities in our Organization and itsspecialized agencies. Granting that request  followingthe good precedent of the World Trade Organization would bring justice to the 23 million inhabitants of theRepublic of China on Taiwan  who through theirexemplary conduct on the world stage have alreadygiven proof of Taipei's attachment to the nobleobjectives of the San Francisco Charter.Last week  the United Nations and theinternational community commemorated theanniversary of the tragic events of 11 September 2001.We express once again our sincere sentiments ofsympathy and compassion to the thousands ofAmerican and other families in mourning. Senegal  itshead of State and its Government strongly reiteratetheir steadfast determination to fight against terrorismin all its forms and manifestations  whatever itsmotivations and whoever its perpetrators and sponsors.Senegal proclaims loudly and clearly that there is noreason or cause sufficiently just or sufficiently goodthat it could justify an act of terrorism against pregnantwomen and other innocent civilians.23The Dakar Declaration against Terrorism  adoptedon 17 October 2001 at the initiative of PresidentAbdoulaye Wade of Senegal  gives full expression toour fervent wish to strengthen regional and subregionalcooperation in order to dismantle the menace ofterrorist activities on our continent. Let us rememberthe heinous and unrepentant terrorist strikes against theAfrican people in Kenya and Tanzania. Nor do weforget the heroic daily resistance of the Algerian peoplein the face of repeated assaults by killers blinded bytheir hatred and not by their faith in God  at least not inthe God of love and compassion that we Muslimsproudly call Allah.To that end  Senegal submitted some months agoto the African Union a draft additional protocol to theConvention on the Prevention and Combating ofTerrorism of the Organization of African Unity and theAfrican Union. The draft protocol aims to strengthenthe Algiers Convention and to adapt it to the post-11-September context. Also  my delegation welcomes thefine initiative of the Commission of the African Union which recently held in Algiers a high-levelintergovernmental meeting on terrorism in Africa. Inother words  we have the common responsibility tomaintain and to strengthen the internationalmobilization against terrorist networks and theirfinancing.My Government welcomes the excellent workalready carried out by the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee pursuant to Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001). Senegal encourages theCommittee to pursue its efforts and requests theWorking Group of the General Assembly's SixthCommittee to do everything to hasten the adoption of acomprehensive international convention againstterrorism.It is a truism that the fight against terrorism is apart of the international community's struggle topromote international peace and security. That is theobjective that over the past months has not escaped ourOrganization  which has strived to find lastingsolutions to conflicts that destroy the social andeconomic fabric of numerous countries  especially inAfrica.In that regard  Senegal keenly appreciates thedetermined commitment of the Security Council which  more conscious than ever of its role ofguarantor of international peace and security  hasdevoted a large portion of its work this year to conflictsand tensions afflicting the African continent. Amongthe numerous praiseworthy initiatives of the SecurityCouncil  I would like to mention the convening ofspecial meetings devoted to the situation of Africa brilliantly presided over by the Ministers for ForeignAffairs of Mauritius and Singapore during theirrespective presidencies.On behalf of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS)  of which Senegal currentlyholds the chairmanship  I would like to nurture thehope that the United Nations will stay the course inorder to forever stave off violence and wars  whichtake a serious financial toll on the future of manyAfrican countries. I am thinking of Sierra Leone  wherethe current exemplary normalization of the politicaland economic situation has largely been facilitated bythe holding of free  transparent  democratic andpeaceful elections.It is urgent that the bells of peace  which havesounded in Freetown  also be heard in Monrovia  wherethe absence of political dialogue led the way to gravesocio-economic instability  whose contagious effectcould turn out to be disastrous for the Mano RiverUnion area. Senegal  as Chairman of ECOWAS  isworking tirelessly and hopes to be able to report to theAssembly on its many initiatives under way  whichcould very shortly lay the foundations of peace inLiberia.In Sierra Leone and Liberia  as in Guinea-Bissau where the Government of President Kumba Yal· isattempting with courage and abnegation to lift thecountry out of a financial and economic crisisfollowing a trying civil war  the internationalcommunity has the duty to continue more steadfastlyits valuable assistance. In that regard  I welcome thestrong signal sent by the Security Council under theUnited States presidency to financial backers withrespect to granting Guinea-Bissau substantial financialaid so that it can firmly return to the path of peace andprosperity.The interest in that neighbour of Senegal and inour subregion recalls the wise and timely decision toestablish at Dakar an Office of the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for WestAfrica. That Office should promote better coordinationamong the activities of the United Nations in oursubregion and their greater impact on the ground. I am24pleased to sincerely congratulate Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan on that clear-sighted initiative. It goeswithout saying that the Office will enjoy theenthusiastic support and complete cooperation of theGovernment of Senegal.Allow me to recall the activities of PresidentAbdoulaye Wade in benefit of the great African peopleof Madagascar. His personal and total involvement inmediating a solution to the Madagascar crisis has  as agreat international statesman said  surely spared thepeople of that great island a drift towards a civil war ofincalculable consequences. He and his Africancolleagues who have taken up that issue have shownthe world that with the strong support of theinternational community Africans will prove that theyare also and above all peacemakers.Elsewhere  beyond the African continent but soclose to our hearts  we observe a growing danger in theMiddle East. This year again  the world has witnessedunheard-of violence in the Palestinian territories  wherethe occupying military Power  Israel  has decidedlyopted for State violence  which leads to concepts asdangerous as the so-called targeted assassinations andother preventive operations.On the Palestinian side  that situation has causedan increase in terrorist cells  specialists in suicidebelts  groups that we unequivocally and resolutelycondemn. That network has produced an erosion oftrust between Israelis and Palestinians  trust thatmust be restored as swiftly as possible through frankand constructive dialogue that leads to a just andlasting solution.In order to achieve that  it is imperative that TelAviv comply with the relevant Security Councilresolutions  in particular resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973) and 1397 (2002)  and that it also adhere to thepeace plan proposed by Saudi Arabia and to theinitiatives of the Quartet  which set out the basicprinciples of land for peace and withdrawal fornormalization. The international community  inparticular the Security Council and the Quartet  has thecritical duty to formulate a bold plan to realize thevision of two States within the 1967 borders and tohasten what Senegal has continued to call for in allinternational forums: the immediate convening of aninternational conference on Palestine  leading to aspecific mechanism that would address political economic and security issues and having as its startingpoint the creation of a sovereign Palestinian State sideby side an Israeli State  living in peace and harmonywith its neighbours.Over the past 12 months  the international scenehas been dominated by the holding of three majorconferences that were crucial events in humanity'scollective march towards a more just and more unifiedworld: the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the WorldTrade Organization  held at Doha  Qatar; theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  held at Monterrey  Mexico; and theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development  held atJohannesburg  South Africa. Those world conferencesand the strong alliances that they created will allowhumanity to enter the third millennium on a positivenote.I should like to note here that  in the light ofthose statements of good intentions  the time for actionhas come. We must act swiftly so that globalization  aphenomenon that affects us all  will ultimately benefitus all. Up to now  despite its certain virtues globalization seems to have caused greatermarginalization of the vast majority of the peoples ofthe South. As a consequence  it is urgent that weidentify innovative mechanisms of developmentfinancing. In fact  even if official developmentassistance is still valuable for the States of the South its effectiveness will be limited without the addition ofconcrete measures such as access for products of theSouth to markets of the North  an increase in foreigndirect investment flows to developing countries particularly those in Africa  and the initiating role that we must recognize  belongs to the international andAfrican private sectors. Indeed  Senegal is convincedthat no country in the world has ever developedthrough official development assistance. The privatesector  infrastructure and education are universallyacknowledged as the tripod of genuine sustainabledevelopment. It is no less urgent  following the much-appreciated appointment of a High Representative ofthe Secretary-General for the Least DevelopedCountries  that we all commit ourselves toimplementing the Brussels Programme of Action  inconformity with the consensus of the 12th MinisterialMeeting of the Group of 49  held at Cotonou from 5 to7 August 2002.The success of such initiatives cannot depend onGovernments alone. We need to build firm partnershipswith local communities  with civil society actors  with25the private sector  with non-governmentalorganizations and with international organizations. It isfitting that humanity's oldest continent should be proudof the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  a double partnership internal and international  and a linkage  on the onehand  among Africans and  on the other  betweenAfrica and the rest of the international community which has already shown its full support for that newinitiative. As evidence  I cite the Group of Eight AfricaAction Plan and the holding of the high-level plenarymeeting of the General Assembly to consider how tosupport NEPAD.Through NEPAD  which has the merit of definingthe prerequisites for African development  ofidentifying sectoral priorities and of developing aresource mobilization strategy  African leaders among them His Excellency Mr. Abdoulaye Wade President of the Republic of Senegal  intend todemonstrate that the responsibility for Africa'sdevelopment is essentially theirs. In that context  Imust mention the launching of the African Union inJuly at Durban  South Africa. We hope that its Peaceand Security Council  coupled with NEPAD's PeerReview Mechanism  will lead to strong commitmentsby our heads of State  first for our people and then forour partners  which are very concerned by the centralquestions of good governance and conflict preventionand resolution.Our development concerns do not preclude ourdemands for human rights. That is why my countryattaches great importance to the promotion andprotection of the rights of women and children. At theinitiative of the Government  a major programme isunder way to combat  in particular  violence againstwomen and the trafficking and exploitation of womenand children for commercial and sexual purposes. Inthose areas  the strategy formulated and implementedby Senegal is based on action plans adopted at thespecial session of the General Assembly on Beijing +5and on the follow-up to the World Summit on Children.As is its custom  Senegal wishes to honour andpraise the great role of women in the world  inparticular their African sisters  as the foundation andthe powerful engine of African renewal. History willtake note that it is Senegal that  through its President has demanded and ensured that each of the fivesubregions of Africa elect at least one woman in itsquota of two Commissioners to the Commission of theAfrican Union. Africa is thus teaching the rest of theworld a lesson in unprecedented parity  which is moreproof  if it were needed  that  if we seek competentwomen  we will find them.At the initiative of its President  Senegal willorganize  on 10 October at Dakar  a special summit ofheads of State or Government of ECOWAS to followup the results of the twenty-sixth special session of theGeneral Assembly  devoted to children.The rights of women and children are integralelements of human rights  and my country reaffirms itsattachment to the principles of the universality interdependence and indivisibility of human rights  ofgood economic and political governance and of the ruleof law. It is that democratic imperative that hasprompted the head of State of Senegal to strengthen ourinstitutional arsenal by creating the position ofCommissioner of Human Rights  to which a womanhas been appointed.As members are aware  Senegal was the firstcountry in the world to ratify the Rome Statute for theestablishment of the International Criminal Court(ICC)  whose entry into force on 1 July 2002 mycountry welcomed. That commitment resulted in myGovernment's decision to present a candidate for judgeon the ICC  one of our finest magistrates and aspecialist in criminal law.In conclusion  I should like  in recalling theurgency of confronting humanity's numerouschallenges  to express the earnest hope that theOrganization will bolster its ability to better serve thelegitimate hopes of the world's peoples. Undoubtedly that path will anchor the future of a world reconciledwith itself  where justice  freedom  peace andprosperity will be jealously preserved in justice andfreedom  in peace and prosperity  and in the dignity ofhuman beings  all human beings."
"150",6187,"SGP",57,2002,"﻿My warmestcongratulations go to you  Sir  on your early election asPresident of the General Assembly  which was the firstfruit of the revitalization efforts of your predecessor Mr. Han Seung-soo. We congratulate both of you onsuccessfully implementing these new procedures.9After the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 the world joined the United States in expressing griefand outrage. Citizens from nearly one half of theUnited Nations Member States perished. A swift determined United Nations response set the stage for aunited global effort to weed out terrorism. Never inrecent history have so many States acted in such unisonas members of one international community as they didin the months following 11 September.That was not inevitable. The internationalcommunity could easily have fractured after 11September . Hence  it is useful to reflect on the forcesthat brought us together and on what key lessons wehave learned.After 11 September 2001  the internationalcommunity rallied together because we all realized thatthe challenges posed by those events affected thecommon interests of all States. The common menace ofterrorism elicited a cohesive psychological response.Everyone is vulnerable. In Singapore  we discoveredterrorists belonging to a regional network with links toAl Qaeda  whose tentacles spread to Indonesia Malaysia  the Philippines  Thailand and even Australia.Its targets were United States  Israeli  British and otherforeign interests.But a cohesive response also requires agalvanizing force. The United Nations provided that.The United Nations also legitimizes internationalaction. On 12 September 2001  the Security Counciladopted  by consensus  its resolution 1368 (2001) condemning the terrorist attacks and expressing itsreadiness to take all necessary steps to respond to theattacks. It was followed shortly by a consensusresolution of the General Assembly  resolution 56/1.Within three weeks of the attack  the Security Councilnegotiated and adopted  again by consensus  itsresolution 1373 (2001)  a landmark resolution whichdealt comprehensively with counter-terrorism andprovided a common legal basis for all States to takeaction against terrorists and their supporters.The Security Council's response to 11 Septemberwas impressive and was possible only because all themajor Powers agreed on the need to respond decisivelyto the terrorist threat. Indeed  the war on terrorism hasreordered international priorities and has created newopportunities for partnership  casting a new strategicoverlay over great-Power relationships.Terrorism is not a new phenomenon. Many of ushave long had unhappy experiences with it. But 11September focused us on its globalized nature andstressed the need for coherence and coordination ininternational cooperation. After 11 September  anumber of international  regional  subregional andnational plans of action and strategies to combatterrorism emerged. Some of these proposals took theform of specific and practical counter-terrorismmeasures. Others assumed a more normative character.These efforts are the building blocks for coordinatedinternational action against terrorism.This commitment to collaborative internationalaction  however  has only recently begun to take shape.Since 11 September  various organs of the UnitedNations system have examined their respectiveresponsibilities and available tools so as to undertakethis collaborative mission in the most effective manner.The report prepared by the Policy Working Group onthe United Nations and Terrorism is a clear example.Coordination and coherence within the United Nationssystem should certainly be enhanced. The commonenemy we face has built up a sophisticated andcomplex global network that requires an appropriateresponse.But as we consider new international mechanismsto fight terrorism  we should pause to reflect on a keyquestion: how can we ensure effective coordinationbetween the United Nations  other regional andinternational organizations and Member States? Howcan we synergize respective international  regional andnational competencies to maximize operationaleffectiveness against terrorism? The United Nationscomparative advantage and aptitude reside in itsconsultative  coordinating and facilitative functions.Ultimately  however  the contributions made bythe United Nations must depend on the political willand resolve of its Member States to make its laws andnorms work. Achieving the right equilibrium ofresponsibilities and obligations is crucial if we are tosucceed in our common mission to defeat internationalterrorism.The battle against terrorism has also to be foughtat the philosophical level. Some terrorists have tried todepict the current global anti-terrorism campaign as awar against Islam. This is obviously not true. Noreligion tolerates terrorism  and Islam certainly doesnot  but we should not ignore the extent to which the10appeal of extremists such as Osama bin Ladenresonates with the marginalized and disenfranchised feeding upon stereotypes and prejudices. At a time ofconfusion and uncertainty  the value of cross-culturalunderstanding and communication cannot beunderestimated.As an international Organization with nearuniversal membership  the United Nations can play akey role in promoting tolerance and understandingbetween nations  cultures and religions. The UnitedNations dialogue among civilizations is a key initiativethat we should build upon. The dialogue amongcivilizations celebrates diversity and introduces a newparadigm of international relations  promoting adialogue among the major world religions and cultures.Dialogue between the different cultures and religionswould help to reduce the sources of prejudice andintolerance that currently colour individual and societalperceptions.Another longer-term challenge is to address theeconomic and social conditions that encourageterrorists. International economic integration isultimately the only guarantor of prosperity  but the factis that globalization is both incomplete in scope anduneven in its distribution of costs and benefits. Manydeveloping countries remain imperfectly integrated intothe world economy. These problems must be addressedby capacity-building and infrastructure developmentwithin developing countries  with whateverinternational assistance is necessary  and by theelimination of trade barriers and protectionism in thedeveloped countries.The events of 11 September underscored that  inan interdependent world  no one is invulnerable. Localproblems can easily be transformed into globalproblems. Each day that we do not act to address andcontain these problems increases their potential to domore harm. Our collective security is dependent on ourability and willingness to confront new challenges. Weshould not await another catastrophe on the scale of 11September before we are forced to act on other equallychallenging global problems that confront us. The waragainst terrorism has to be waged with both guns andbutter.I would like to conclude by sharing ourexperiences on the Security Council. Almost two yearsago  members of the General Assembly gave Singaporethe honour and privilege of serving as one of theelected members of the Security Council. Our termends this December. I want to thank all those whoshowed their trust in us by giving us this uniqueopportunity.Our experience has been a fulfilling andenriching one from which we have drawn importantlessons and insights. The Security Council has gonethrough many phases. Designed first of all to deal withinter-State conflicts  the Security Council hasincreasingly moved towards handling intra-Stateconflicts in the post-cold-war era. But the terroristattacks of 11 September were an unprecedenteddevelopment. They produced a new era  confrontingthe Security Council with a new and distinct threat tointernational peace and security. Singapore hastherefore served in two very different SecurityCouncils  one before 11 September and another afterthose tragic events.For the Security Council to remain effective  ithas to demonstrate that it can respond effectively tonew challenges. Otherwise  its relevance andcredibility will be compromised. As a small State  weare vulnerable to such terror attacks. As a member ofthe Security Council  we have supported initiativeswhich address this new threat.A key lesson that we have learnt is that  for all itsimperfections and occasional failings  the SecurityCouncil often does work. It is nevertheless too early togauge the success and effectiveness of the SecurityCouncil in responding to the scourge of terrorism.Whether the Security Council can continue to developappropriate responses over the long run at this plasticphase of the creation of a new strategic era will be acritical test of its relevance in the new century.It is naive to expect that the swift unity of globalaction post 11 September will henceforth bedemonstrated on all global issues. Our experiences inthe Security Council attest to protracted processesbeing the norm rather than the exception for coalescinginternational action. But where international consensushas not yet consolidated over situations posing seriousand immediate threats  the lack of internationalconsensus in itself cannot be an excuse for inaction.That would be an abdication of individual andcollective responsibility.Finally  as one of two Asian elected members ofthe Council  we were pleased to make a smallcontribution to the East Timor success story. Thissuccess was made possible only by the hard work andsacrifices of its people  with the support of theinternational community. Today  the United Nationscontinues to play a critical role in preserving the peacein East Timor and in ensuring that the Government andpeople of East Timor have the opportunity to succeedin their quest to build a democratic  stable and viableState. We look forward to welcoming East Timor as the191st Member of the United Nations.Let me conclude by warmly congratulatingSwitzerland for becoming the 190th Member of theUnited Nations. Switzerland may be a new member;however  it has also provided the second mostimportant venue for United Nations activities. It hastherefore long been a partner of the United Nationsand  I believe  this partnership will be deepened withits membership."
"151",6220,"SLB",57,2002,"﻿Onbehalf of the Government and people of SolomonIslands  I wish to congratulate the President on hiselection to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session4of the General Assembly. I am confident that  under hisexperience and skilful leadership  we will reachpositive results for this Organization and for allpeoples of the world.I also thank His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-Soo Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republicof Korea  for his distinguished service in presidingover the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.In the same manner  I thank His Excellency Mr.Kofi Annan  Secretary-General  for his good anduntiring efforts and his dedication aimed at realizingthe principles and purposes of the United Nations.Like others who have spoken before me  I alsowish to congratulate East Timor  our close Pacificneighbour that is soon to be a member of the UnitedNations  and Switzerland as a new member of theUnited Nations. Solomon Islands looks forward todeveloping further relationships with those twocountries through bilateral and multilateral means.As we journey into this new millennium challenges facing the international community are moredaunting. Human ingenuity and technological advancescomplicate those challenges. Acts of terrorism andarmed conflicts proliferate in many parts of the world.Prospects for progressive economic and social servicesand security  and improved living standards for the vastmajority of the world's population have become mereunrealized dreams.Nonetheless  as an international instrument forthe promotion and the betterment of human life  theUnited Nations has considerable ability and experiencein pursuing what is best for the common good of allpeoples around the world  including guaranteeingworld peace and security through the Security Council.Today I reaffirm the commitment of SolomonIslands to the principles of the Charter. I also wish toplace on record the appreciation of Solomon Islands forthe worthy assistance from other United Nations organsand agencies  including the Economic and SocialCouncil  the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP)  the International Labour Organization (ILO) the World Health Organization (WHO)  the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO) and the Commission onHuman Rights.Solomon Islands also upholds its faith in theSecurity Council and acknowledge its important role inthe maintenance and promotion of international peaceand security. At the same time  we recognize thechanging scene in the international political andsecurity environment. Those changes must be reflectedin our Organization as well. The reform of the SecurityCouncil must continue  including a review on therelevance of the provisions of veto power accorded topermanent members. Moreover  Solomon Islandssupports the expansion of the permanent membershipof the Council to include Japan and Germany. Thosetwo countries have so much influence in the globalpolitical and economic arena and therefore they arebetter placed to contribute constructively and positivelyto world peace and security.For a small island nation like Solomon Islands the United Nations is the foremost institution to turn toin time of trouble and need. My predecessor stated thatfrom this rostrum last year. At that time  he elaboratedon the circumstances of the conflict that had erupted inSolomon Islands between November 1998 and October2000.Today  we are still struggling with the outcome ofthat devastating conflict. We have lost much. We haveto do much more to reconstruct the destroyed fabric ofour country. That is the course my Government hascharted  in order to maintain our sovereignty withdignity and to show integrity and respect as a Memberof the United Nations family.The mandate to lead the country was clearlygiven to me through the democratic process whenSolomon Islands held its post-conflict general electionon 5 December 2001. The polls returned a newParliament of 50 duly elected members  charged with aclear working majority of 29 out of the 50 members.The national coalition Government for peace  unity andreconstruction assumed office and undertook thechallenging task of rebuilding Solomon Islands.The foremost strategy that my Government hasadopted is to pursue four policy areas: first  therestoration of peace and security; secondly  education;thirdly  health and medial services; and  fourthly productive sectors.We began this important work during the first 100days of entering into office. We have sinceconsolidated our efforts  notwithstanding practicaldifficulties that emanate from the lack of financial andthe absence of other relevant resources.5Our second strategy is the formulation of anational economic recovery plan. That plan focuses onstrengthening agriculture  fisheries  forestry  mining manufacturing  tourism and infrastructure developmentsectors. Besides giving closer attention to thepromotion of health and education services  the planalso addresses population growth and ensurespromotion of responsible environmental management.I am happy to state that  at present  we are alsoworking on a sustainable development plan for ourcountry. An integrated financial package for thisstrategy has been submitted to our developmentpartners. Thus far  the responses received  whileencouraging  still raise questions that require seriousand genuine consideration in view of our presentcircumstances. It is here that we sincerely look to theUnited Nations for assistance in facilitating closerconsultation and constructive engagement with theWorld Bank  the International Monetary Fund and theAsian Development Bank.The huge amount of debt that burdens poorcountries is real  and it continues to afflict most third-world countries  including small States such asSolomon Islands. This is a real challenge that mypeople and country face as we make our best effortsand endeavours to rebuild our nation and maintain ourindependence and sovereignty with dignity  integrityand respect during these difficult times and in thefuture. On this important point  the United Nationsshould consider supporting debt forgiveness forcountries that are debt-strapped. Solomon Islands canbe included in this category.A few days ago  the people of the City of NewYork  the United States of America and the rest of theworld paid moving tributes to the thousands ofinnocent lives tragically lost through the cowardly andsenseless acts of terrorism committed on 11 September2001. The heroic men and women who perished at thatsad time now deserve a special place in our hearts andin the annals of history.My Government is taking steps to accede to anumber of international conventions relating tocounter-terrorist activities. We have communicatedthese important measures to the United Nations. Weseek the assistance of the United Nations and membersof the international community to enhance our efforts.The increase in armed conflicts and the illegaltrade of small arms are directly linked. Armed conflictshave increased in most parts of the world. They arefuelled mainly by the availability of the illegalmanufacture  official sale or supply of small arms  andthis has resulted in the loss of innocent life. Over thepast 50 years  small weapons and landmines havekilled more people than weapons of mass destruction.Small arms have also found their way intoSolomon Islands  and they have been used in the three-year conflict which has adversely affected mycountry's sociocultural cohesiveness and goodgovernance. In no uncertain manner  this has crippledthe economy. The continuing presence of small arms incommunities has posed a major threat to the peace security and stability of my nation. Any hope ofeconomic recovery is constantly threatened bylawlessness. Notwithstanding this  the Governmentremains committed  within its limited resources  toretrieving arms and restoring confidence to our peoplein the communities. However  we believe that theinternational community  through the United Nations has a pivotal role to play in assisting the country to riditself of armed threats by taking more ambitious actionto curb the arms culture that is taking root in ourcountry.Peace of mind and safety from danger are notachieved by the mere absence of war. Rather  they arethe product of a nation's ability to achieve sustainableeconomic prosperity  better education  and health andsocial services for all its people. Peace and security forevery human soul comes down simply to meeting themost basic needs.Even with the successful outcome of the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  which includedpromises of economic growth and protection of ourenvironment  Solomon Islands remains sceptical aboutthe practical outcome of action plans for developingand least developed countries. We have committedourselves to similar action plans for sustainabledevelopment in the past. Agenda 21 of 1992 and theBarbados Programme of Action for small islanddeveloping States  among others  are valid policyblueprints for sustainable development. Unfortunately we have not lived up to our commitments. We all havefailed. That is why world leaders again assembled  inSouth Africa  to take stock of our failures and makenew commitments. And indeed  new commitmentshave been made. Now is the time to test thecommitments made in South Africa.6As The Honourable Laisenia Qarase  PrimeMinister of Fiji and Chairman of the Pacific IslandsForum  aptly said in his address at the World Summit let us turn our words into deeds. Solomon Islands canonly hope that  this time around  there is a will to leadus eventually to the goals and objectives set at theWorld Summit in South Africa.Solomon Islands is very much aware of itsvulnerability to natural and man-induced disasters.Like other small island developing countries  wecontinue to seek of the international community notonly to recognize the uniqueness of our vulnerabilitybut also to take concerted action towards achievingmany of our goals and objectives for sustainabledevelopment  collectively as a group and individuallyas nations.The communiquÈ issued by the recent PacificIslands Forum summit held last August in Suva  Fiji reflects the political  economic  security andenvironmental issues that are important to the region.These need our collective resolve  as well as theattention and cooperation of the wider internationalcommunity.The adverse impact of sea-level rise is a threat tothe economies and survival of small and low-lyingisland countries  in particular in the Pacific  theCaribbean and the Indian Ocean. Scientific researchand reports  including the Third Assessment Report ofthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  issuedin 2001  have given us all the more reason to be deeplyconcerned. Solomon Islands joins other small islandStates in calling again on the countries that have yet tobecome parties to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocolto do so  and seriously to commit to reducing theirgreenhouse gas emissions.The least developed countries still grapple withthe harsh realities of poverty  vulnerability to externaleconomic shocks  debt burden  poor infrastructure  andpoor or limited access to better education  health social services  and the list goes on. Even with anincreasing commitment to globalization  the situationof many least developed countries and nation-Stateshas neither improved nor stabilized. In many instances conditions have worsened.Solomon Islands believes that the renewedcommitment through the Brussels Programme ofAction for the Least Developed Countries for theDecade 2001-2010  adopted at the Third UnitedNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries is a timely action by all international organizations torefocus attention and global resources on the neediestand poorest countries. We support the immediateimplementation of the Programme and note withsatisfaction the progress that has been made so far.Solomon Islands once again calls upon the UnitedNations to respect the expressed wish of theGovernment and the people of the Republic of China tobe readmitted as a full and equal member of thisOrganization. The world has marvelled at Taiwan'seconomic transformation. Within a short span of time it has not only established a stable and vibrantdomestic economy  but also has become one of theworld's most influential economies in terms ofinternational trade  investment outflows andinformation technology. Taiwan is a sovereign countryin full control of its own affairs and with influence inthe world economy  and it is unjust to deny its peoplethe right to stand tall and be counted among the manynations represented in international institutions.Taiwan is a willing and able country  ready toshoulder the obligations of the United Nations andother international organizations. Taiwan has proveditself through its international economic cooperationwith many developing and least developed countries.Solomon Islands is convinced that that there are nolegal barriers to Taiwan's membership in the UnitedNations  only political obstacles. Let us therefore castaside those political obstacles and take a positiveapproach by according the Government and the peopleof the Republic of China the membership they deserveand the opportunity to fully participate in the affairs ofthe United Nations under its Charter."
"152",6266,"SLE",57,2002,"﻿Two years ago Icame to the rostrum of this Assembly with mixedfeelings. On the one hand  my country had justwitnessed an unprovoked attempt to derail the peaceprocess. The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone(UNAMSIL) was still recovering from a brazen affrontto its military capability and the authority of theSecurity Council. On the other hand  I was optimistic first of all because the people of Sierra Leone had onceagain demonstrated their resolve to maintain theirstruggle for peace. I was also optimistic because theSecurity Council had responded appropriately bygiving UNAMSIL additional responsibilities within itsmandate  and by increasing the troop level of themission.Today  I stand here with only one feeling  anoverwhelming feeling of joy. At long last the rebel warin Sierra Leone is over. All combatants have beendisarmed and demobilized. Reintegration is well underway. Over 55 000 ex-combatants are currently engagedin reintegration programme activities  ranging fromformal education and vocational-skills training tosmall-scale trade  agriculture and communitydevelopment. While the National Commission onDisarmament  Demobilization and Reintegration isconcentrating on the integration of ex-combatants another national agency  the National Commission forSocial Action  is actively engaged in programmes thatwill benefit all categories of victims of the brutal war particularly the most vulnerable population groups.Most heartening of the recent positivedevelopments was the affirmation four months ago bythe people of Sierra Leone that they would never forgotheir constitutional right to choose their leaders freelythrough the ballot box. They sent a resounding messageto the entire world that  in Africa  it is still possible tohold free and fair elections.4Our objective was not merely to win the rebelwar  but to defend the right of our people to live. Wefought against a brutal attempt by a few who  with theassistance of forces within and outside the subregion were determined to assume power and gain unimpededand perpetual access to our mineral resources. Myprimary objective as the democratically elected leaderwas for us to win the peace. Today  I am pleased to sayhere that the people of Sierra Leone are continuing towork assiduously to win the peace.We share the view that there cannot be real peacein Sierra Leone without justice. The support that wehave so far received for the establishment of a specialcourt to bring to justice those who bear the greatestresponsibility for serious breaches of internationalhumanitarian law and the national laws of Sierra Leoneshould also be regarded as part of the peace dividend.We are also convinced that we cannot speak aboutlasting peace in Sierra Leone without nationalreconciliation. Making the Truth and ReconciliationCommission fully operational after its inauguration inJuly 2002 has now become one of our majorpreoccupations. Let me add  however  that inadequateinternational support for the Commission couldjeopardize prospects for national reconciliation which members will agree with me  is one of the prerequisitesof lasting peace and justice.The victory that the people of Sierra Leone haveso far achieved in the peace process is theirs  but nottheirs alone. It is also a victory for the United Nations the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) and the entire international community.Indeed  it is a victory for humanity  for all those whocherish the dignity and worth of the human person.Therefore  let me take this opportunity  on behalf ofevery Sierra Leonean  to express our profound andsincere gratitude to the United Nations family ECOWAS and its Monitoring Group  and other regionalintergovernmental and non-governmental organizationsfor their support in our prolonged struggle. This was apartnership for peace and security that we will neverforget.With your permission  Sir  I am obliged onceagain to single out for commendation some specialfriendly States that played a crucial role in that effort. Irefer to the United Kingdom  the Federal Republic ofNigeria  the Republics of Guinea  Ghana and Mali  andthe United States of America and China  among others.We will always remember their place in the greatpartnership for peace and security that wrenched SierraLeone from the verge of total destruction. This is whatcollective responsibility is all about in ourinterdependent world.While we celebrate our mutual success  weshould at the same time be aware of the challenges thatwe face not only in Sierra Leone  but also in the ManoRiver Union and the West African subregions. Oursuccess notwithstanding  the situation in our part of thecontinent continues to pose a threat to internationalpeace and security. That threat will remain and couldincrease if we fail to consolidate the gains that we havemade in Sierra Leone. I should therefore like toreiterate my recent appeal to the United Nations andthe international community as a whole to remainengaged in our national effort to consolidate our hard-won peace. I was encouraged that  following the May2002 elections  the Secretary-General and the Presidentof the Security Council underscored the need to furtherconsolidate what we have achieved so far.The people of Sierra Leone and the internationalcommunity have made considerable investment inmaterial and human resources to bring us to the stage atwhich we find ourselves today. It would be a terriblemistake if  by sheer complacency and a failure to adoptthe appropriate course of action  we should allow thecountry to slip back into armed conflict. We share theview of the Secretary-General  expressed in his latestreport on UNAMSIL  that the Organization shouldensure that the next phase of the Mission does notjeopardize the progress achieved so far in stabilizingpeace in Sierra Leone.Beyond Sierra Leone  there are ominous signs ofspillover conflicts hovering around the subregion. Itwould also be tragic if we should underestimate thecurrent threat to peace and go on procrastinating aboutways of preventing a spillover.How then do we go about ensuring  at least in theshort run  that Sierra Leone will sustain its newly-wonpeace? How do we contain the current hostilities acrossthe border with Liberia? The need to address thesequestions has become more urgent as we approach theend of the current mandate of UNAMSIL. Whilelooking forward to the new phase of that importantinstrument of peace  I thought that I should draw theattention of the Security Council  through theSecretary-General  to some of the issues that could be5taken into consideration and linked to an exit strategyfor UNAMSIL.Recently  I shared my thoughts on this and relatedmatters in a letter which I addressed to the Secretary-General. The letter has since been circulated asSecurity Council document S/2002/975 of 29 August2002. Permit me to highlight some of the issues raisedin that communication. These are issues related to thecapacity of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces and theSierra Leone police to perform their respectivefunctions more effectively throughout the country; thechallenges facing us in the integration of all ex-combatants; the risks following from the turbulentsituation in neighbouring Liberia  and particularly itsrepercussions for peace and stability in Sierra Leoneand the Mano River Union as a whole; the danger ofthe apparent absence of a strategic plan of theinternational community to address the situation inLiberia  especially as the country approaches crucialelections next year; and finally  the delay in respondingto the request for international assistance to ECOWASin ensuring security on the borders shared by Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone.We are pleased that the Secretary-General hastaken these and other issues into account in preparinghis recommendations to the Security Council for ameasured and phased downsizing of UNAMSIL. Thiswill ensure that we do not provoke any new sense ofinsecurity in a population that has been traumatized fortoo long. I am also confident that the Security Councilwill consider the recommendations carefully  especiallyin the light of my Government's and the Secretary-General's own assessment that the conflict in Liberiastill constitutes the most serious threat to the stabilitythat now prevails in Sierra Leone. Who will forget thatthe 10-year rebel war in Sierra Leone was launchedfrom the territory of Liberia?The current state of peace and security in SierraLeone and the rest of the Mano River Union subregionis obviously a matter of constant concern to us.However  as a member of the global community  we arealso seriously concerned about impediments tointernational cooperation for economic and socialdevelopment; about threats to international peace andsecurity  including the nuclear arms race and terrorismin all its forms and manifestations; and about the rightsof such vulnerable population groups as children andpeople with disabilities. All those often requireappropriate multilateral agreements or arrangements toensure that they are effectively addressed.Never since the end of the Second World War hasmultilateral cooperation become such a necessarymeans for resolving international disputes and forensuring the well-being of people everywhere. SierraLeone  therefore  attaches the utmost importance to thestrengthening of multilateral cooperation  as reflectedby such recent conferences as the InternationalConference on Financing for Development and theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. Thoseprovide effective platforms for articulating the interestsof all States and for devising common strategies toaddress collectively problems that would otherwiseoverwhelm the capacities of individual countries orregions.It is  therefore  self-evident that we must continueto pursue the multilateral approach to those and otherinternational issues. The consequences of diminishingor bypassing the multilateral approach in matters thataffect the lives of millions of people worldwide could I should emphasize  be disastrous for us all.Two years ago  in the Millennium Declaration heads of State and Government  in the spirit ofinterdependence  made a commitment to work togetherin achieving specific goals in areas such as peace security and disarmament  human rights  goodgovernance and poverty eradication. Those goals areall underpinned by a strong belief in the principles ofmultilateral cooperation and shared interests.Of special significance to us are the commitmentsmade by the world leaders in the MillenniumDeclaration to meet the special needs of Africa. That isnot only because Africa has the largest number ofcountries classified as least developed  and in whichalmost half the population lives in abject poverty. It isalso because we have all benefited and stand to benefitfrom each other's resources.In spite of its current level of overalldevelopment  Africa has a lot to offer to the rest of theworld. Of course  we Africans realize ourresponsibility  first and foremost  to develop andimplement strategies for improving the quality of lifeof our people and for strengthening our capacity tocontribute more effectively to the economies of ourpartners in the developed world.6In effect  that is what the New Partnership forAfrica's Development (NEPAD) is all about —partnership among African countries  partnership withthe rest of the world and progress for all mankind. It isin that context that the conclusions reached at the high-level meeting of the Assembly earlier this week onways and means of supporting NEPAD assumesupreme importance for my country.In a similar vein  Sierra Leone also welcomes thecommitment of the eight major industrialized countries the G-8  at their recent meeting in Canada  to providestrong support to NEPAD and to establish enhancedpartnerships with African countries whose performancereflects the NEPAD commitments. Sierra Leone  for itspart  is determined to pursue vigorously the objectivesset out in NEPAD  not just because we need donorassistance at this time  but more so because we believein the soundness of those objectives as a vehicle for theeradication of extreme poverty  the achievement ofsustainable development and the assumption of greaterresponsibility for our own destiny.I began by assuring the Assembly that I came thistime with one overwhelming feeling  a feeling of joyover recent developments in my country. Of course  thesearch for sustainable peace with justice and nationalreconciliation is a continuous process  and we are wellaware of the challenges that we still have to face.However  I can say with confidence that what we haveso far achieved  with the support of the United Nationsand the international community  has provided themomentum for us to meet those challenges."
"153",6313,"SLV",57,2002,"﻿Allow me to express  on behalf of the peopleand the Government of El Salvador  our most sincerecongratulations to the President on being elected toconduct the work of this session of the GeneralAssembly.Likewise  we would like to express ourrecognition to Mr. Han Seung-soo for the successfulwork he carried out during the past session. Wecommend Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his workand attention in the prevention and solution ofconflicts  and we encourage him to continue movingforward in the reform process of the United Nations.26We welcome to this important world forum theSwiss Confederation and  soon  the DemocraticRepublic of Timor-Leste in their new capacity ofMember States. In this context  we reiterate our requestto review the special international situation of theRepublic of China on Taiwan  whose 23 millioninhabitants are being denied the right to representationin this forum. We nurture the hope that in the nearfuture the participation in this world Organization ofall the nations of the world without exclusion — as iscurrently the case with Taiwan — will become areality.The Government of El Salvador is convinced thatit is necessary to examine new and visionary initiativesto remove existing obstacles in the discussions on thecomposition and role of the Security Council in thenew millennium. That is necessary and essential inorder for the United Nations to continue to be theprincipal world forum of collective action in the face ofchallenges to international peace and security.This year  my country commemorated the tenthanniversary of the signing of the peace accords  whichput an end to armed conflict and paved the way for anew reality of hope  peace  democracy anddevelopment. Our democratic process hasprogressively been consolidated and is advancing withnormality within the same dynamic of open debatesand deliberations that characterize all democracies.This has been a result of the firm desire of allSalvadorians to construct a free and democratic society which we  the Member States  should feel proud of andpart of  through the successful role played by theUnited Nations.In the economic and social fields  we haveachieved significant progress in strengthening peaceand democracy. The Government of PresidentFrancisco Flores Pérez has strongly promoted aneconomic model featuring economic rights as a meansto advance towards development and to take advantageof the opportunities offered by the opportunities ofglobalization. We have also favoured humandevelopment  investing primarily in education  health housing and basic services  as those areas areindispensable elements contributing to social well-being  to the improvement in the quality of life of ourpeople and to development.Ten years after the signing of the peace accords El Salvador has successfully culminated its peaceprocess and is now enjoying the dividends of peace.Therefore  we are grateful for the valuable support ofthe international community and of the United Nations.We are particularly grateful to the Group of Friends ofthe Secretary-General for the peace process of ElSalvador — Colombia  Mexico  Spain  Venezuela andthe United States of America — for the support theyoffered during the unfolding of that process  whosesuccessful outcome continues to assist efforts forconflict resolution throughout the world.With regard to Central America  I wish toreaffirm El Salvador's spirit of integration  which leadsus to attach high priority to our relations withneighbouring countries in seeking commondevelopment for the region and in strengthening theCentral American integration process in its political economic and social facets. We do so because it is onlythrough a stable and united region that we will be ableto complement one another in order to strengthen ourposition in the world economic environment and jointlyface the challenges of globalization. Only throughintegration will we be able to overcome our narrowterritorial limitations to effectively respond to the justdemands of our citizens in the areas of education health and opportunities for the future. Being unitedand open to the world as a region will be the only waywe will be able to cease to appear small in the face ofthe great challenge of creating  with all the requisitespeed  more and better jobs so that all our peoples willbe able to forge for themselves a worthy future in theirown homelands.It is in that context that the Presidents of CentralAmerica have agreed on an economic integration planof action effective immediately. That plan includes theformation of a customs union by next year. Likewise among other things  we will continue to work onadopting common duty tariffs and facilitating trade andthe free movement of all products. With that goal inmind  and having already attained positive results withthe Central American agreements now in effect withMexico  the Dominican Republic  Chile and Panama we are also jointly negotiating free trade agreementswith Canada and United States. We are also working tostrengthen and implement the Puebla-Panama Plan byimplementing eight large meso-American integrationprojects. Through the Puebla-Panama Plan we intend totake advantage of the potential of Central America andof the southern and south-eastern regions of Mexico as27a natural corridor linking North and South America andjoining two oceans.We have responsibly assumed the historicalchallenge to address through relevant bodies the borderdisagreements inherited by the current generation ofCentral Americans. El Salvador has done its share inthis regard. We are convinced that strict compliancewith international law provides the foundation forharmony among neighbouring countries. We havetherefore recently reached an agreement at thepresidential level with the Republic of Honduras toaccelerate the demarcation of our territorial borders.Furthermore  we have also recently resorted to theInternational Court of Justice to exercise our right torequest a revision of its 1992 judgement  but only withregard to one of the six areas in dispute in the case thatwe jointly submitted in 1986. Through these efforts  ElSalvador and Central America are clearing the way inorder to make unencumbered progress towards therealization of our common integration projects. In theend  our goal is for the borders that we are nowdefining through law to be erased in practice byharmony  mutual respect and the development of ourpeoples.In the international sphere — having justcommemorated the first anniversary of the terroristattacks perpetrated in the United States — theGovernment of El Salvador would like to reiterate itsfirm commitment to the worldwide struggle againstterrorism and all related criminal activities. We viewthis global effort as a joint and individual endeavour ofMember States. Consequently  we see it as an effortlinked to the deepest respect for the principlesestablished in the Charter of the United Nations  ininternational law and in international humanitarian law.In that connection  the Government of El Salvadorwould like to express its gratitude for the efforts beingmade by the Counter-Terrorism Committee establishedby Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). We alsoreiterate our complete readiness to cooperate in theunequivocal implementation of that resolution. Inaddition  we would like to inform the internationalcommunity that El Salvador will host the third sessionof the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism.That meeting will be held in San Salvador during thefirst half of 2003. We hope the meeting will adoptrelevant decisions to further strengthen the hemisphericfight against this scourge.El Salvador recognizes the progress achievedwith the entry into force of the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court. In this regard  myGovernment is carrying out the necessary reviews tobring our constitutional rules in line with those of theStatute  so as to enable us to initiate the process ofjoining the Court.In the same vein  I am also pleased to inform theAssembly that last week El Salvador ratified theInternational Convention on the Protection of theRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of TheirFamilies  as well as the Optional Protocol to theConvention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale ofChildren  Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.In his report on the implementation of theMillennium Declaration  the Secretary-General statedthat the world in which we live today is dividedbetween rich and poor as never before in humanhistory. That report also pointed out the harsh realityexperienced by one sixth of all human kind  whichdaily fights to survive in a life and death struggle withsickness  hunger and natural and human disasters.Meanwhile  another sixth of mankind has attainedlevels of well-being that would have beenunimaginable just a few decades ago. Between bothextremes there are the 4 billion inhabitants ofdeveloping countries who  although we may no longerbe living on the verge of disaster  are very far fromachieving the security  capacity and material well-beingenjoyed by the developed world.As a developing country  El Salvador is followingthe course charted at Monterrey. We hope that theoffers of funding made by various countries at theConference will become a reality. We are also activelyparticipating in the preparatory work for the WorldSummit on the Information Society  as we areconvinced of the potential benefits that connectivityand knowledge will bring to the future development offree societies.In that sense  El Salvador shares the vision thatinternational cooperation with medium-incomecountries must not be exclusively limited to technicalcooperation. That cooperation should also includefinancial cooperation  as the fight against povertyshould not be confined by borders or limited bystatistics pertaining to national averages. Such figuresare far from being a true reflection of existing realitiesin different places. Our renewed democracies need to28be consolidated  strengthened and made sustainable ina way that gives everyone access to a better quality oflife.Another of the major challenges we face  namely natural disasters  could nullify the efforts we havemade throughout the years. The devastating effects ofsuch phenomena are no longer limited solely totraditionally vulnerable regions. As was the caserecently in many European countries  other regions thatpreviously had not been very much affected by naturaldisasters are now experiencing them. In thisconnection  the people and the Government of ElSalvador would like to reiterate their completesolidarity with the Governments of affected countriesand with the families that have suffered as a result ofthe devastating floods in Europe.The Government of El Salvador calls on theinternational community to jointly implement theagreements reached in the five basic areas taken up bythe World Summit on Sustainable Development thattook place recently in Johannesburg  South Africa.Those included water and sanitation  energy  health agriculture and biological diversity. All of them are ofcrucial importance to the future of the environment particularly in developing countries.Allow me to conclude by reiterating the firmcommitment and political will of the Government of ElSalvador to contribute actively to the search forcollective and individual solutions to the problems thatwe will take up during this session of the GeneralAssembly. We also wish to reiterate our confidence inthe work that the Secretary-General is doing on behalfof the nations that make up our Organization and on thebasis of the purposes and principles enshrined in theCharter. Along with the strengthening ofmultilateralism  those purposes and principles remainentirely valid in the new millennium."
"154",6338,"SMR",57,2002,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment of the Republic of San Marino  I wish firstto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan on hiselection as President of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. I am convinced that his experience professional skills and dynamism will contribute to thesuccess of our work. I also wish to thank Dr. HanSeung-soo for having presided over the GeneralAssembly in one of the most difficult and delicatemoments of our recent history.Inevitably  this session of the General Assemblyis still suffering the consequences of a deep  indeliblewound that  a little more than a year ago  was inflictedon the whole of humanity  on the people whocontributed to creating this civilization and  inparticular  on a great and friendly nation  whose rolehas always been crucial to the future of our planet.Feelings of pain and fright  but also rebellion  arestill vivid in the minds of each and every one of us.The firm and absolute condemnation of what happenedlast year in September remains unchanged and has beenfurther strengthened by the determination to spare noeffort in combating and if possible defeating thedreadful threat of terrorism  which is still present.However  San Marino is convinced that fightingterrorism exclusively through military  political andeconomic actions is not enough. We must ask ourselveswhy terrorism comes about and develops  whyfundamentalism and fanaticism exist  why someindividuals who proclaim to fight for the liberation ofthe oppressed become instruments of death. We mayhave found an answer  and that is why we keep onrepeating in all forums  that as long as the world isstricken by hunger  poverty  underdevelopment inequality  oppression  ignorance and violations ofhuman rights and fundamental freedoms  there will beno solution to all the political  economic and socialsituations that are inexorably degenerating  which wecontinue to witness with a growing feeling of anguish uncertainty and instability for a whole generation  forthe whole of mankind.With that in mind  San Marino has fullysupported the initiatives and the procedures establishedby the Security Council to stem the expansion ofterrorism. The Republic I represent has met in a timelymanner the requirements set forth by the Counter-Terrorism Committee established by the SecurityCouncil itself. In the same way  a number of legislativeand financial measures on anti-terrorism adopted bySan Marino Parliament and Government are evidenceof our will to proceed with the ratification of therelevant international Conventions and of the intentionto pass a special law to counter terrorism and itsfinancing.We also believe that dialogue and toleranceamong all peoples of the world are further instrumentsto combat terrorism and fundamentalism. That calls notonly for effective political action  but also for a newculture to develop within peoples  where diversitybecomes a universal heritage  and leads to unity ratherthan division  helps eliminate  rather than worsen disparities  brings different cultures  religions andtraditions closer together  rather than turning them intoinstruments of incomprehension and confrontation.It is a disgrace that a solution to the ongoingconflict and violence in the Middle East seems out ofreach. Terrorist attacks and military reprisals furtherexacerbate hatred and revenge  undermining anypossibility of promoting negotiations and dialogue onthe basis of mutual respect and protecting human rightsand fundamental freedoms. San Marino is deeplyconcerned about the worsening situation in this areaand strongly condemns the spiral of violence plaguingthat region and indiscriminately causing victims everyday  mainly among civilians  especially women andchildren.Israel has the legitimate right to exist within itsown borders and to defend and protect its ownpopulation. Palestinians have the same legitimate right to live on their own land and the right to self-determination within their own State. Therefore  wedeem it imperative that both parties respect the rules ofinternational law and fully comply with all UnitedNations resolutions. Most recently  tensions haveescalated further because of the possibility of a waragainst Iraq in order to remove its President  SaddamHussein.The Republic of San Marino can certainly neithertolerate nor accept that the world be held hostage by15unscrupulous dictators who are absolutely unreliableand who are probably willing and able to jeopardizeinternational security. Yet  any action  includingmilitary intervention as a last resort  would in any caserequire the consensus and authorization of the UnitedNations.The international scene is marked on many frontsby dread and insecurity. Nonetheless  San Marinofollows with interest and supports the intensive activitythat the United Nations is conducting to tackle anumber of issues with the ultimate goal of attaining amore civilized  equitable  humane society fit forhumankind.We followed with great attention the majorconferences that the United Nations promoted andorganized in 2002  especially those on children  theageing and sustainable development.The twenty-seventh special session of the GeneralAssembly on Children agreed that in order toimplement the principles enshrined in the Conventionon the Rights of the Child  it is imperative to attainthree major objectives: to guarantee children a decentstandard of living in a safe environment in which theycan grow up and develop physically  mentally andemotionally in a healthy manner; to ensure that theycan complete at least primary school; and to provideadolescents with the opportunity to strengthen theirindividual capacities in a safe environment  so that theywill be able to fully participate in and contribute to thesociety in which they live. San Marino shares thosepriorities and has adopted a number of legislative social and cultural initiatives to implement thosefundamental principles.My country also welcomes the activities carriedout by the international community which  on theoccasion of the Second World Assembly on Ageingheld last April in Madrid  adopted a politicaldeclaration and a new plan of action to safeguard theinterests and needs of the elderly  a population groupwhich has so far probably been neglected although itwill considerably increase in number over the next fewyears.San Marino attaches great importance to thesignificant changes brought about by the Assembly inthe methods used to face and solve the problems of theageing population  while seeking to eradicatestereotypes and prejudices. We have a feeling that in sodoing  the international community has laid down thefoundations for a future plan of action that will ensurefor all human beings wellness  health and security inthe last years of their lives.Also within the framework of the United Nations although it had different objectives  the recent WorldSummit on Sustainable Development held inJohannesburg  South Africa was also of greatimportance. San Marino is aware that the economicgrowth of the most developed nations must go hand inhand with economic growth at the global level.Globalization  however  cannot be imposed. On thecontrary  it must be conceived as an opportunity for allStates and populations. It must facilitate access tomarkets for developing countries and promote targetedinvestments that take social and environmentalconsiderations into account. At the same time  we haveto build confidence and foster economic well-being toachieve the integration which we all deem to beessential. Such integration is also a precondition for theprotection of both the environment and culturaldiversity.I would like to recall that the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court entered into force on 1July  2002. With that formal achievement  thecommunity of States made a great leap forward in theprogress of international law  the Court being not onlya judicial institution created to prosecute genocide andcrimes against humanity  but also clear evidence of thewill existing at an international level to avoid grantingimpunity — as is too often the case — to perpetratorsof atrocious and intolerable crimes against peoples orindividuals.As well  because of the role of guarantor assignedto that institution  the Republic of San Marinoparticipated in the celebration of the fourth anniversaryof the Court on 17 July  2002 and was the first State inEurope to ratify its Statute. Furthermore  myGovernment believes that the International CriminalCourt does not in any way endanger the internationalpeacekeeping forces. On the contrary  the Court furtherguarantees their protection through the articles of itsStatute. For that reason  my country hopes that theInternational Criminal Court will be joined andsupported by as many countries as possible  and thatpractical solutions will be found that do not alter theStatute of Rome but that guarantee the continuity ofpeace operations.16On this occasion  on behalf of the Government ofSan Marino I feel it is my duty to reaffirm theimportance and the key role played by the GeneralAssembly as the main decision-making andrepresentative body. Unquestionably  the functions ofthe General Assembly and the effectiveness of itsdecisions need strengthening. Moreover  the GeneralAssembly should intensify its co-operation with theother United Nations bodies  primarily with theSecurity Council. A working group to which SanMarino has also contributed ideas and proposals hasbeen studying Security Council reform for eight years.All Members probably know that San Marino has longtaken a stance in favour of an increase in the number ofnon-permanent members on the Security Council while it agrees neither with an increase in permanentseats nor with the extension of the right of veto. Weconsider that this would have a positive effect on manyactivities of the United Nations and therefore that itwould be beneficial to relations among and betweenStates; it is something which is now sorely needed.I wish to conclude by reasserting that the onlyway to overcome the consequences of the painfulevents that we have recently experienced is to pool ourefforts and to work together  honestly and actively  inorder to start a virtuous cycle in which the objectivesof civil and tolerant coexistence among peoples andnations are universally shared  supported and pursued;in which the values of solidarity  respect for human lifeand dignity dismantle the barriers of selfishness andoppression; and in which democracy and freedom fromall constraints and needs become effective.These are the same objectives that a small Statecalled the Republic of San Marino  which I have thehonour to represent here today in the most authoritativeand prestigious international Organization  has soughtto achieve over 17 centuries of history in a consistent persistent but also humble manner."
"155",6376,"SOM",57,2002,"﻿Allow me at the outsetto congratulate you  Sir  on your election as Presidentof the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Iam confident that with your experience you will guidethis session to a fruitful conclusion. I would also like toextend my thanks to your predecessor  AmbassadorHan Seung-soo of South Korea  for his excellentstewardship of the previous session of the GeneralAssembly.Somalia welcomes the Democratic Republic ofEast Timor and the Swiss Confederation to themembership of this family of nations. This is a furtherstep towards the realization of the goal of theuniversality of the United Nations Organization.A year after the tragic events of 11 September2001  we in Somalia continue to share the feelings ofpain and loss of the Government and the people of theUnited States. We must  as a community of nations  actin unison to combat the scourge of terrorism.In this regard  the Transitional NationalGovernment of Somalia continues to be a reliablepartner in the campaign against terrorism. It is myprivilege to announce to the Assembly that myGovernment this year signed the Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism.We have also started the process of acceding tothe Convention on the Prevention and Combating ofTerrorism of the African Union. We are also workingon the implementation of the other requirements ofresolution 1373 (2001). Furthermore  we are committedto fully cooperating with other countries on a bilateralbasis in the fight against terrorism and continue toidentify concrete areas of such cooperation. MyGovernment's resolve in this regard is not based on anyshort-term tactical considerations but is unequivocaland based on solid principles.We would like to commend the United Nationsfor organizing a number of international conferences in2002  starting with the International Conference onFinancing for Development and the recent WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  held inJohannesburg  South Africa. We also applaud the22United Nations for dedicating a day of discussions onthe New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD)  which focused on the development needs ofthe African continent.We strongly feel that the international communityshould pay more attention to the development needs ofthe least developed countries. Donors and creditorsshould be able to do much more in the areas of trade debt and aid. We believe that free and fair trade is avehicle for growth and development  and that thus weare required to make greater efforts to ensure thatmultilateral trading caters to the urgent and specialneeds of the least developed countries.In this regard  we are encouraged by Canada'sunilateral decision to lift tariffs on African exports toCanada and to abolish subsidies on agriculturalproducts. It is our hope that other developed countrieswill follow the example set by Canada.With regard to debt  we believe that  unless themassive debts owed by the least developed countriesare completely cancelled  those countries will remainstrangled by interest and loan principal payments.Aid can be another engine for development andgrowth and  in this respect  the donors must honour theagreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national productfor official development assistance.We cannot but address the plight of thePalestinian people  who are subjected to daily horrors.The killing of innocent civilians  including women andchildren  the destruction of houses and the dailyhumiliations inflicted upon the Palestinian people byIsrael must be condemned by the internationalcommunity.It is unconscionable for the internationalcommunity to stand idly by and watch the continuoussiege of President Yasser Arafat and the premeditateddestruction of the Palestinian Authority. The people ofPalestine  who continue to suffer under the Israelioccupation  have an inalienable right to a State of theirown and to choose their own leadership andinstitutions. The systematic violation of thefundamental human rights of the Palestinian peoplemust be brought to an end.The scourge of conflicts has been afflicting theAfrican continent for decades. In fact  Africa at onetime was dubbed the “continent of conflict”. It isgratifying to note that there is a new horizon — that anew dawn is illuminating the darker parts of ourcontinent in conflict. Conflict resolution by Africansthemselves is the motto today. A strong wind of peaceis blowing in Africa. In Sierra Leone and Liberia in theMano river region; in Angola; in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Rwanda and Burundi in theGreat Lakes region; and in Ethiopia  Eritrea and theSudan in the Horn of Africa  the ship of peace issailing. We strongly welcome this movement towardspeace in the African continent.As members are aware  Somalia has been an areaof a conflict  a conflict that brought untold suffering tothe people of Somalia  a disastrous civil war fomentedby unpatriotic warlords  resulting in the destruction ofall State institutions  the death of hundreds ofthousands of Somalis and the displacement of millions.Despite the good intentions of the United Nations Somalia suffered from the neglect of the internationalcommunity  especially after 1993. The Somali conflictseemed intractable.It was not until August 2000 that a TransitionalNational Government and a Transitional NationalAssembly were constituted and a head of State  HisExcellency Mr. Abdikassim Salad Hassan  was elected.That was a result of a conference held in Arta  in theRepublic of Djibouti  attended by more than 3 000Somalis from all regions and all walks of life including traditional leaders  intellectuals  businesspersons and women. The warlords were repeatedlyinvited and opted not to participate.The Transitional National Government ofSomalia has continued to engage in dialogue those whochoose to be outside the Arta process  with a view tobringing them on board. We have been persistent inencouraging them to renounce war as a means ofachieving political gains  and we share our vision ofpeace and national reconciliation in Somalia and forthe Somali people.In our endeavours to achieve peace and stabilityin Somalia  we have also engaged our brotherselsewhere in the subregion  regional organizations andthe United Nations  to assist us in the search fordurable peace in Somalia.I am happy to note that the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development (IGAD)  with the strongsupport of the international community  has undertakena serious peace initiative for Somalia. IGAD hasmandated the three frontline States of Kenya  Djibouti23and Ethiopia  under the chairmanship of HisExcellency President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya  towork out the modalities and time frames for completingthe Arta peace process. This has the support of thecurrent Chairman of IGAD  His Excellency Mr. OmerAl-Bashir  President of the Republic of Sudan  and theheads of State of other IGAD countries. The IGADprocess for the completion of the Arta process hasstreamlined the various and often conflicting initiativesfor the first time.IGAD has announced that a conference for thecompletion of the reconciliation process will be held inKenya on 15 October 2002. The Transitional NationalGovernment will participate. We will participate withan open mind and with the interest of the Somalipeople as our foremost priority. The TransitionalNational Government will spare no effort to make thenational reconciliation conference a success. We aregratified that the international community hasrecognized that the Arta peace process continues to bethe most viable basis for peace and nationalreconciliation in Somalia. It is our hope that thoseregional administrations and other parties that havebeen outside the Arta process will share our vision forpeace and stability in Somalia.In this regard  it is of critical importance that theinternational community send a clear message to all theSomali participants to support the IGAD-sponsoredconference in Kenya  making clear that those who tryto sabotage it or refuse to participate will be sanctionedby the international community.Equally important is the issue of guarantees forthe outcome of the reconciliation conference. Webelieve and request that the international communityshould put in place regional and international measuresguaranteeing both the finality and the legality of theoutcome of the conference in Kenya. The internationaland regional guarantees must ensure that sanctions willbe imposed on any Somali group that rejects theoutcome of the reconciliation conference in Kenya.When the Somali parties agree on a peaceframework during the October conference in Kenya there will be an urgent need for internationalpeacekeepers. There will also be an urgent need fordisarmament and for the rebuilding of nationalinstitutions in Somalia. We urge the United Nations tobe ready for this and to plan to meet the newchallenges of disarmament  the demobilization ofmilitias and reconstruction.The wind of peace that is blowing across theAfrican continent has finally reached Somalia. As theTransitional National Government  we are committedto the re-emergence of a new Somalia that is at peacewith itself  its neighbours and the world. As a law-abiding State  we pledge to respect our obligationsunder the United Nations Charter and the ConstitutiveAct of the African Union and to remain a partner forpeace and development in our continent and throughoutthe world."
"156",6413,"STP",57,2002,"﻿It is a great honour forme  as the new President of the Democratic Republic ofSao Tome and Principe  to appear before the Assemblyfor the first time and to join in the deliberations of thisfifty-seventh session.On behalf of the citizens of Sao Tome andPrincipe  I should like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of this fifty-seven session andrequest you to accept my warmest greetings and thoseof my people. May I also extend our congratulations toTimor-Leste  soon to be a Member of the Organization and to Switzerland  which has just become a Member.We hope that East Timor's becoming a full member ofthe international community will guarantee that itsbrotherly people will have the right to live free of thehegemonic appetite of some of their neighbours.Few people in the world have ever heard of mycountry  Sao Tome and Principe.Few people  even in this Hall  could find Sao Tome andPrincipe on a map. We are a small island-nation in theGulf of Guinea  off the coast of West Africa. We arepoor. We are remote. Despite our isolation  my peopleface the same issues that confront every country in theworld today: first  how to protect innocent people fromacts of terror  violence and mass destruction; secondly how to eliminate the grinding poverty that still afflictsand cripples half the world's population and affectspeople in every country on Earth; and  thirdly  how tosave our environment and protect the world's naturalresources from degradation and ultimate destruction.As much as any people on the face of this planet we deplore terrorism. We condemn those who killcivilians and target women and children  and we say tothem  `You are wrong to take the lives of the innocent whatever the reason  whatever the cause.' That is whatmy people in Sao Tome and Principe believe.And so it is that last 11 September my tiny nation with its population of only 140 000 people  only a verysmall fraction of the population of the City of NewYork  was horrified by the attacks on the World TradeCenter and the Pentagon. We send our condolences tothose in all the many countries who lost friends andfamily there. We join in condemning those who carriedout these terrible acts. We call for their capture andincapacitation. That is what we feel.We turn to the United Nations for leadership. Welook to the people in this great Assembly Hall to speakand to act for civilization  for freedom and for justice.An American politician  Hubert Humphrey  said it best:`The heroes of the world community are notthose who withdraw when difficulties ensue  notthose who can envision neither the prospect ofsuccess nor the consequence of failure  but thosewho stand the heat of battle  the fight for worldpeace through the United Nations'.I commend the President of the United States forcoming to New York to consult and confer with thosewho represent the community of nations. This act isconsistent with the finest and most admirable Americantradition. If I can use Thomas Jefferson's words in theDeclaration of Independence of the United States  Iwill say that President Bush's decision to address theUnited Nations on the subject of Iraq shows a `decentrespect for the opinions of mankind'.On behalf of the people of Sao Tome andPrincipe  I declare our unconditional support for theeffort to protect innocent people from acts of terrorismand to defend our populations from weapons of massdestruction. The United Nations must lead the way. Thenations of the world must act together as one. It is amoral duty. Sao Tome and Principe offers whatresources we have to assist in this noble effort.But war and terrorism and violence are not theonly threats to the lives of our people. More insidious more pervasive and more deadly than even war itself isthe poverty that kills many millions of men  womenand children needlessly every year. Poverty is silent but it is insatiable. It is unrelenting. I come from one ofthe poorest countries in the world. We are grateful toall those who have come to us and have helped us sinceour independence on 12 July 1975. I take thisopportunity to thank all of you.But we cannot  and will not  continue as we aretoday  without clean water  without health care  withoutelectricity  without jobs  without schools and withouteven a primitive infrastructure or the capacity to buildone. Sao Tome and Principe cannot be left behind. Wedo not want our neighbourhood in the global village tobe a ghetto slum. We want to be part of the informationage. We want to receive  to learn how to use and tomaster the technology that brings enlightenment affluence and opportunity. Many years ago  anotherbrilliant son of this country  the United States ofAmerica  Abraham Lincoln  said`A house divided against itself cannot stand. ThisGovernment cannot endure permanently halfslave and half free'.The same can be said today about the rich nations andthe poor nations of our world. A house divided againstitself  our house  this planet Earth  cannot endurehalf rich and half poor. We must do better.Sao Tome and Principe now stands at acrossroads of development. We are strategicallysituated in the most important petroleum area in theworld today: the deep water off the western coast ofAfrica in the Gulf of Guinea. With exploration successwould come enormous wealth and potential power tomy country. Sao Tome and Principe is therefore facinga moment of opportunity that African nations rarelyencounter  or have historically squandered.20Just 100 years ago  my people lived in slavery.We picked cocoa off trees for the enrichment of distantEuropean landowners  while we lived in chains without decent housing  education or even basic humandignity. But we have come far in a very short time. Mypeople are brave. We are strong and we are united. SaoTome and Principe led the way in Africa in September1990 in transiting from one-party rule to a multi-partysystem. My country is now a robust democracy  whichenjoys some of the strongest stability in Africa. I am aproduct of my country's free and fair elections  havingbeen elected just over one year ago  the second freelyelected President since our independence in 1975. Ipromised my people that Sao Tome and Principe wouldbe a model for oil transparency and sustainableeconomic development based on democracy  humanrights  the rule of law and a diversified free-marketeconomy. We invite you to share with us in achievingour goals.I would now like to draw the attention of theGeneral Assembly to the following situation. We aretoday congratulating two countries on their entry as fullmembers of the United Nations. But the task ofachieving universalism in the United Nations has unfortunately  still not been completed. I take thisopportunity to pay special tribute to another country with a population of more than 20 million inhabitants which has achieved admirable economic and socialprogress through democracy  but which theinternational community continues to fail to recognizeas an independent and sovereign nation. I am referringto the Republic of China on Taiwan. Sao Tome andPrincipe hopes  and urges  the Organization of UnitedNations to resolve this case soon as a matter of justiceand to declare and accept Taiwan as an independentand sovereign nation.Having said that  I turn again to the UnitedNations to say that the final challenge is perhaps themost difficult challenge facing the Organization namely  to save the Earth itself. I appeal to those whofuel the factories of globalization and who drive theengines of progress and economic development. Youare the ones who endanger the planet with yourpollution. You are the ones who cut down forests  whoburn the fossil fuel  who poison the oceans  whodestroy the atmosphere and who warm the planet. Youare the ones who can lead the world to develop cleanertechnologies  more efficient uses of natural resourcesand effective ways to restore our land  air and sea.There is no time left.The people of Sao Tome and Principe live on twosmall islands in the Atlantic Ocean. If sea levels risefrom global warming  my beautiful island home willdisappear beneath the waves. We know better thanmost people that if we spoil our homeland we havenowhere else to go. We must live with the waste thatwe make  and we cannot quickly grow back the treesthat we cut. If we cut down the trees that shade andprotect our food  the banana trees  the cocoa trees we will starve. If we put poison in the water andchemicals in the earth  we will die. Whatever we do tobring prosperity to our land  we must do it in a waythat respects the water and air and flora and fauna thatmake up our islands' environment. We must find a wayto make progress that supports and sustains life ratherthan destroying it. The planet Earth is like Sao Tomeand Principe in that respect: it is nothing more than anisland in the universe. We must take care. We must dobetter."
"157",6454,"SUR",57,2002,"﻿Thecreation on 24 October 1945 of the family of nationsbrought the peoples of the world values  principles andgoals to cherish and to realize. The founders of theUnited Nations brought us hope; they brought us newbelief in the future of humanity after two world wars.They opened the eyes of the world community to suchkey issues as human dignity  equality  tolerance  peace national and international security  social and economicprogress  and respect for human rights.How do we deal with those precious gifts? Dowe  the Member countries — large and small; powerfuland less powerful; developed  less developed anddeveloping — make the optimal use of those tools toshoulder the necessary responsibility and solidaritywith one another and with our peoples  in particular themost vulnerable ones among us: our children  olderpersons  persons with disabilities  persons withHIV/AIDS  women and men  and older and youngerpersons who are suffering from extreme poverty hunger  deadly diseases  drought and war crimes?In my statement today on behalf of theGovernment and the people of the Republic ofSuriname  in which those fundamental issues should beaddressed  I would first like to express feelings ofpeace and love to the entire United Nations family:peace and love  which was brought to us in the peacemessages of the President and of the Secretary-Generaland in the beautiful songs of the United Nations Choirduring the Peace Bell Ceremony  held this morninghere at Headquarters  on the occasion of theInternational Day of Peace; peace and love to you  Mr.President  because of your unanimous election to thathigh Office  because of your readiness to serve andbecause of your country's important contribution to thelofty goals of the Organization; peace and love to yourpredecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his energeticguidance and leadership during the remarkable fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly; and peace andlove to the dedicated and inspiring Secretary-Generaland to the entire Secretariat — those who work activelyevery day everywhere in the United Nations systemand who  despite their difficult roles  which includesecurity personnel  interpreters  conference officers field workers  information and communicationtechnology personnel and personnel in the variousagencies and programmes  always stand ready to servehumanity with a kind smile.Peace and love were enshrined in the recent 11September message of President Runaldo RonaldVenetiaan of the Republic of Suriname to PresidentGeorge W.

To promote unity in our society  theideals of peace and respect for one another's culturesare incorporated into our national educationalprogrammes and are taught from an early age.The human rights based approach todevelopment  including the notion that human rightseducation is a key to development  should beembraced. Therefore  the national education plan ofSuriname will also deal with human rights education.Awareness should be raised that poverty among ourpeoples is a serious violation of their human rights:every human being has the right to an adequatestandard of living with regard to health  medical careand well-being — the right to education  to food  tohousing and to social services in general.Suriname has ratified all major human rightsinstruments. We welcomed the special attention of theCommittee on the Elimination of Discriminationagainst Women during the consideration of  amongother things  Suriname's initial periodic report submitted last June  on the importance of human rightsas a way to transform society and as a birthright. Mydelegation emphasizes that no equality can be achievedunless human rights become a way of life.Therefore  on behalf of my Government  I wouldlike to express my heartfelt thanks to the former HighCommissioner for Human Rights  Mrs. MaryRobinson  for the excellent manner in which shecarried out her duties. At the same time  we wish towelcome the newly appointed High Commissioner forHuman Rights  who is from our region: Mr. SergioVieira de Mello of Brazil.We extend our best wishes to him  and areconvinced that he will guide us in promoting andprotecting the effective enjoyment by everyone of allcivil  cultural  economic  political and social rights including the right to development  in accordance withGeneral Assembly resolution 48/141.If we indeed want the United Nations to maintaininternational peace and security  we need to abide byand implement the various resolutions and decisions ithas adopted towards this goal. The commitments declarations and action plans drafted at the variousUnited Nations follow-up conferences held this yearwill have to be implemented. The difference inpositions of various countries poses a threat tointernational peace and security  especially with regardto the consequences of trade liberalization fordeveloping countries.Achieving the Millennium Development Goalsmust be our first priority  and this achievement shouldnot be jeopardized by an increase in defenceexpenditures.We welcome Iraq's recently announced decisionto allow the return of United Nations weaponinspectors into the country; we also applaud therecently agreed peace plan that aims to achieve  by2005  a final settlement towards a peaceful solution tothe conflicts in the Middle East.If we want to guarantee international peace andsecurity  we have to live up to the challenge of creatinga world fit for children; a world without child-soldiers;a society for all ages  where people are no longerstarving  dying of famine  drought or living in extremepoverty; where there is respect for human rights  therule of law and international law; where there is fairtrade  sustainable development  good governance; andwhere each individual has the right to development  theultimate goal being to improve the quality of life ofevery human being — children  women  men  olderpersons and persons with disabilities.According to the 2002 Human DevelopmentReport  many countries are poorer than they were 10 20  and in some cases  even 30 years ago; genuineattention should be given to these most vulnerablepeople. Developing countries can by no means meetthe needs of their people on the basis of their ownfinancial resources; Governments of the developedworld  international financial institutions and donorcountries should increase their official developmentassistance.Poverty eradication should be a high priority inour countries. Our poverty eradication programme isdesigned in such a way that it emphasizes not onlylabour demanding growth  but also  and especially domestic capital demanding growth. Our Governmenthas confidence in a programme focusing on technologyand the education of our people to elevate ourpopulation to higher material and spiritual levels.Education is an important vehicle leading to theawareness of health problems  such as HIV/AIDS malaria and tuberculosis  human rights and democracyissues  criminality  including cross-boundary crime and drug trafficking. Suriname has a long tradition and28history regarding the involvement of civil society andother non-State actors in the development of ourcountry and attaches great importance to realpartnership between Government  civil society andnon-governmental organizations in the fields of socialaffairs  education and health  among others.During our participation last Monday in the high-level General Assembly session on the NewPartnership for Africa's Development  we expressedthe solidarity of the Government and People ofSuriname with our brothers and sisters on the Africancontinent and our strong support for Africa'sdetermination to emerge from poverty  hunger andfamine  and such destructive deadly diseases asHIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  in order to builda strong and lasting culture of peace and democracybased on Africa's precious natural and humanresources and its cultural wealth.Information and communication technologies(ICT) must be considered as essential for thesustainable development of peoples and societies; therights-based approach to development should includethe right to information and communicationtechnologies. ICT has been recognized as an effectiveinstrument in the fields of economic growth knowledge  education at all levels  poverty eradication people's empowerment  capacity-building  decision-making and the promotion of sustainable development.The United Nations Secretary-General should becommended for the timely initiative within the UnitedNations system to create the United NationsInformation and Communication Technologies TaskForce  which plays a vital role in the preparatoryprocess for the World Summit on the InformationSociety in December 2003 in Geneva and 2005 inTunis. Various ICT programmes and projects forchildren  students  older persons and others  are beingcarried out in Suriname by the Government  theuniversity and civil society.My country will continue to support the work ofthe United Nations. We are committed to implementingthe plans of action of the important follow-up UnitedNations Conferences held this year — namely  theSpecial Session on Children  the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  the WorldAssembly on Ageing  the World Food Summit and theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development.The challenges that we face with regard toeconomic  social and environmental development areto cut poverty in half within the next 10 years. MyGovernment is committed to working on the economicgrowth and poverty eradication of our own people. Weare also faced with the challenge of improvingenvironmentally-friendly and healthy products andconsumer goods; protecting and managing the naturalresource base of Suriname; improving the sustainabledevelopment of small island developing States; andstrengthening the management of sustainabledevelopment at the national  regional and internationallevels.Because Suriname is situated in the Caribbeanregion  the region with the second highest rate ofHIV/AIDS-infected people in the world  this issue is ofutmost importance. Besides HIV/AIDS  malaria andtuberculosis pose grave threats not only to health ingeneral  but also to the labour sector and to the socialand economic development of Suriname. We are therefore  now taking the necessary steps to submit arequest for funding through the United Nations GlobalFund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria.We are faced with a vast amount of issues thatneed to be solved  and agreements and programmesthat need to be implemented in order to improve thelives of our peoples. The United Nations still proves tobe the best place to collectively discuss the problems ofthe world and to look for lasting solutions. It is up to usto live up to our commitments as Members of theUnited Nations and to create better living conditionsfor our people. We can only hope that this wouldeventually lead to stability in and between ourcountries  and ultimately lead to peace and security  asenvisioned by the founders of this great Organization.Secretary-General Annan and Assembly PresidentKavan  at this morning's Peace Bell ceremony exhorted the international community to heed themessage of International Peace Day and let it resoundfar and wide  spreading dignity  justice  understanding solidarity and prosperity.Let there be peace on earth. Let peace begin withall of us who are assembled in this beautiful  historicalGeneral Assembly Hall. May the Almighty be with allof us."
"158",6478,"SVK",57,2002,"﻿Let me begin  Mr.President  by congratulating you on your well-deservedelection. It is a great pleasure to see you  my goodfriend and colleague  preside over the proceedings ofthe General Assembly at this session. My delegation isready to provide its full support to you. Let me alsoexpress my gratitude to your predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo  for his dedication andaccomplishment.Slovakia welcomes Switzerland as the newestMember of our Organization. We look forward also towelcoming East Timor and to working closely withboth of them in promoting peace  security andprosperity throughout the world.The terrorist attacks on the United States a yearago evoked worldwide anguish and outrage  followedby enormous solidarity among nations throughout theworld and a firm stand by the worldwide coalitionagainst the scourge of terror. At the end of the day those cowardly acts of terror did not reach theirultimate goal: chaos  anarchy and the destruction of the12world community. On the contrary  they strengthenedour resolution to seek world peace and security and topromote life in dignity and prosperity for all. Slovakiapledged its full support for the anti-terrorist coalitionfrom the very beginning.As the ruins of the World Trade Center weresmouldering at the southern tip of Manhattan  theGeneral Assembly  the Security Council and theSecretary-General acted quickly  resolutely andcollectively. The United Nations proved to be crucial inthe fight against terrorism  which should be maintainedas a global campaign. Organizing this global task mustbe central to our efforts at the United Nations. Weacknowledge the role of the United Nations in trying toraise the capacity of every Member to defeat terrorismin a globally coordinated way and in conformity withSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001)  which wasadopted unanimously by the Council last year.Since 11 September 2001  the Slovak authoritieshave adapted and strengthened domestic legislation sothat it can be applied effectively against acts ofterrorism. Slovakia deposited its instrument ofratification to the International Convention for theSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism earlier thismonth  and has thus become party to all 12international conventions and protocols againstterrorism. Their provisions are already incorporated inour domestic legislation. We are committed to continueour cooperation in these endeavours with the relevantUnited Nations institutions.Shortly following 11 September 2001  the AlQaeda network and the Taliban regime that harbouredthose terrorists were fought and disrupted. Organizinga global response to the political and humanitariancrises in Afghanistan became one of the crucial tasks atthe Untied Nations. A chance for the people ofAfghanistan to start rebuilding their country  which hadbeen fragmented for so long  has been offered. Wecommend the work of the United Nations AssistanceMission in Afghanistan and the countries contributingto the International Security Assistance Force. Slovakiais actively engaged in the reconstruction andrehabilitation process in Afghanistan. An engineeringunit from Slovakia was dispatched to take part in theOperation Enduring Freedom in August 2002.Slovakia reaffirms its commitment to armscontrol  disarmament and the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. We effectively participatein regional and global efforts in the field ofdisarmament and international security. The increasedthreat of international terrorism today gives rise toquestions regarding the relationship between terrorismand disarmament  as well as the contributions thatmultilateral treaties and institutions in this field canmake. We must make greater progress in achievingdisarmament and non-proliferation goals  strengthenverification and implementation mechanisms  andthereby contribute to the creation of a safer world inwhich terrorism cannot breed and flourish. We willcontinue to work cooperatively and constructively inthe pursuit of disarmament and arms limitation goals.Over the last decade we have witnessed anupsurge in ethnic  social and religious violence all overthe world  when simmering tensions and powerstruggles boiled over into open conflicts. There hasbeen an increasing demand for the United Nations tointervene with regard to those threats to internationalpeace and security. As a result  peacekeeping hasbecome more frequent and more complex. Modernpeacekeeping operations are multidimensional  withtasks ranging from traditional deployment of militarypersonnel  demining and medical support  to verification disarmament  the rebuilding of infrastructure and thefacilitation of institution-building  democratization andelections. Peacekeeping operations have changed also interms of the financial resources they require.My Government has always been fully committedto the maintenance of international peace and security.Peacekeeping has always been an important aspect ofour involvement in United Nations activities. Slovakiacurrently provides military personnel and observers forseven United Nations peacekeeping missions  in Ethiopiaand Eritrea  in Cyprus  in Iraq  in Jerusalem  on the GolanHeights  in Sierra Leone and in East Timor. The numberof Slovak military personnel serving under the UnitedNations flag has steadily increased since the mid-1990s.Currently  there are more than 600 troops  apart from theSlovak soldiers participating in missions in the Balkansunder NATO leadership. Slovakia will remain activelyengaged in this crucial area of the United Nationsresponsibilities in the future.Let me pay tribute to those courageous men andwomen from various nations who contributed to the peacemissions and who lost their lives while serving under theUnited Nations flag. My country has also suffered theloss of lives. Four brave Slovak men have beenawarded  in memoriam  the Dag Hammarskjöld medal.13Resolutions adopted by the Security Councilunder Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter arelegally binding. The failure of any Member State tofulfil the requirements of those resolutions constitutes abreach of the Charter. In such cases  the internationalcommunity has the right to enforce the rule of law. Wehave carefully noted the decision of the Government ofIraq  announced earlier this week  to allow the return ofUnited Nations weapons inspectors without conditions.Yet that decision needs to be matched with furtherconcrete steps which would provide for the swift andfull implementation of the relevant Security Councilresolutions.The question of Israel and Palestine has beenoccupying our attention since the United Nations wasfounded. It is our common responsibility to achieve acomprehensive solution resulting in the existence of twoStates living side by side in peace and mutual respectwithin secure and recognized borders. We fully supportthe efforts of the diplomatic Quartet on the Middle Eastto push forward the vision of peace in the region.Slovakia is fully committed to the rules andprinciples of international law and justice. In that context we attach particular importance to the work of theInternational Court of Justice. The Court has proved to bea very useful institution for resolving inter-State disputes including some serious territorial disputes. Thatinstitution deserves full support  including financialsupport  from the General Assembly. Slovakia and itssouthern neighbour have previously submitted adispute to the Court. Now  having already recognizedthe Court's jurisdiction over a number of Europeancountries  we are in the process of preparing adeclaration that will recognize the general compulsoryjurisdiction of the Court  in accordance with article 36 paragraph 2  of the Statute.We remain convinced that  as the main repositoryof international law  the United Nations must play animportant role in strengthening legal approaches tofighting the most serious crimes of international concern.Slovakia fully supports the work of international criminaltribunals  as well as the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court. We have signed and ratified the RomeStatute of the Court. Slovakia became one of the countrieswhose ratification was necessary for the entry into forceof the Statute on 1 July 2002. Despite various concernsand reservations expressed by some Member States ofthe United Nations  we continue to believe that theCourt has the potential to promote the rule of law andto prevent impunity by persons who commit the mostserious of crimes.Our position on the issue of Security Councilreform is linked to the importance we attach to makingthe Organization more effective. Let me once againunderline this position. In addition to maintaining itsnecessary representative character  the SecurityCouncil should also preserve the required operationalflexibility. Slovakia supports the enlargement of theSecurity Council in both the non-permanent as well asthe permanent category. We consider it fully justifiedfor one additional non-permanent seat to be allocatedto the Group of Eastern European States  as thatGroup's membership has doubled in the last decade.As the world becomes more and more global  theUnited Nations should respond by becoming ever moreuniversal. The concerns of all nations should belistened to irrespective of their size  geographiclocation  military strength or economic power. We haveno doubts as to the irreplaceable role of the UnitedNations in tackling global issues  whether with regardto the protection of human rights  the eradication offamine  poverty  disease and illiteracy or prevention ofthe proliferation of drugs and weapons.We all live on one planet. We must all face thedeterioration of the environment and together adoptadequate measures to guarantee sustainable development.The Millennium Declaration shows us the right way. Theworld community must now increase its efforts to meetall of these goals. The Monterrey and Johannesburgsummits proved that much can be achieved if decisionsare based on global consensus. They also showed thepower of having the will and determination to tackleglobal issues. We now have to concentrate on thefulfilment of our commitments. We need deeds. TheUnited Nations should play a leading role inmonitoring the implementation of our decisions. Weneed a United Nations that is strong and efficient."
"159",6503,"SVN",57,2002,"﻿It was 10 years ago immediately following the admission of newbornSlovenia to the United Nations  that I addressed theAssembly for the first time. I did so with great pride with faith in the United Nations and with gratitude forthe chance given to my country to present to theinternational community its own views on currentworld affairs  with a sense of responsibility for itsactions not only towards its own citizens  but alsotowards the entire international democratic community.Looking back at the past decade  I can saywithout the slightest reservation that  without theUnited Nations  life on our planet would be even moreuncertain  social injustice would be even morewidespread and global disparities in prosperity evenmore marked. There would be even more systematicviolations of human rights in many States and evenmore wars.In spite of its acknowledged weaknesses andinefficiencies  this world Organization has done greatwork. I daresay that  throughout its membership Slovenia  too  has contributed to this through its ownactive pursuit of the principles of the United Nations. Itreceived widespread recognition for the work itaccomplished as a non-permanent member of theSecurity Council; this is something of which we areparticularly proud.2The United Nations decisions at the historicMillennium Summit have already placed theOrganization in the future realm of our global world.The violence committed by States against their ownpeoples is now faced with a new force: the ethic of thedemocratic world. This ethic does not recognizeabsolute State sovereignty or absolute non-interferencein internal affairs when systematic mass violations ofhuman rights  through State terror  occur.The principle of humanitarian intervention is thebeginning of an important process of implementingglobal ethics in the governance of this globalized andincreasingly interdependent world. It is also a clearmessage to the authors of international law and tointernational judicial institutions. It is one of the pillarsof the next phase of international law  as is theInternational Criminal Court. No one any longer hasresponsibility only towards themselves. Statesovereignty is no longer untouchable. Everyone  intheir actions  also has a responsibility towards globalsociety  for in an increasingly integrated world  theactions of one easily affect others.Certain measures of the global community ofStates in response to the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury  such as the special session on the future ofchildren  the World Summit Sustainable Developmentand the forthcoming meetings on a better future forAfrica are signs that the United Nations is gaining inpolitical and moral clout as an Organization common toall States and as an organization capable of finding thestrength to carry out the announced internal reforms.In that context  Slovenia supports theimplementation of the Millennium Declaration and theSecretary-General's proposed reforms. That theseefforts are urgently needed became particularlyapparent last year on 11 September  a day of tragedynot only for New York  Washington and the UnitedStates in general  but for all humanity. The entiredemocratic world joined in the fight againstinternational terrorism. Slovenia also did so with greatresolve. No one who cared for humanity just stoodaside.But as time passed  it became increasingly clearthat even the best military weaponry of the anti-terrorist coalition could not reach down to the socialroots of this horrendous evil. This evil is craftily takingadvantage of the apathy and the anger of people andStates without a future. This evil is trying to regain itsstrength by playing on religious  cultural andcivilizational differences  intertwined with the greatsocial rifts in our global world. Evil  understood in thisway  an evil that threatens to use the most atrociousweapons of mass destruction  can be eradicated onlythrough concerted action by democratic States underthe umbrella of the United Nations.It is precisely in this context that the authorityand credibility of the United Nations are on trial. TheOrganization has proven itself capable of reachingcommon positions and decisions even on the mostdemanding issues. We are capable of defining commonpositions  even concerning the actions of those who donot respect these common decisions. The UnitedNations now must have the ability not only to speak ofthose positions  but also to implement them throughconcerted action. That is the responsibility that all of usface today.Globalization  with all of its positive and negativeaspects  is a given fact. Let us do more to transformthat fact into something that is in keeping with theneeds of the people and the rule of individual andcollective human rights. Certainly  this cannot beachieved by trying to drive peoples  States  cultures religions and civilizations away from their ownidentities  by trying to place them under the commondenominator of a single global identity. That wouldsignify the collapse of our human world  bearingdisastrous consequences. Today's world  where bordersbetween States  and particularly betweencivilizations  are growing less rigid  is a world full ofplural identities and of clearly defined national cultural and religious entities that are beginning toopen up to one another.This plurality calls for a unique integrating factor.That factor can only be a global ethic based on theancient principle of reciprocity among human beings:do unto others as you would have others do unto you.In times of interdependence among each and every oneof us  such values are particularly important. Theglobal ethic should be developed based on this value for it is a value with deep roots in the world's age-oldgreat religions and civilizations. Based on this value we will be able to strengthen universal human rightsand global social justice  and without that justice  onecannot expect the world to be a safe and peaceful placeoffering people justified hope that our planet belongs toall of humanity.3International terrorism has unveiled the negativeaspects of interdependence among our societies. Wemust now do more to strengthen the positive aspectsand to create new ones. The environmental  economicand ethical challenges humanity is facing today requirea radical rethinking of global governance and theestablishment of global responsibility. This is so muchmore so since we are faced with the breakdown ofregulation and control in global trade  with aninequitable global development machinery thatgenerates misery and humiliation  and that manifests arelentless preference for economic and financial logicover ecological  social and human demands. A positivealternative must be found to these negative aspects ofour interdependence.Present generations of statesmen  politicians academicians and civil society all have a duty to lay thefoundations of a global ethic and a United Nations thatoffers stronger guarantees for a world that is no longerso fiercely divided into peoples  nations and Stateswith the right to a future and those who are robbed ofthat future by the technological and social gaps of ourplanet.I am convinced that there will be a kinder futurefor our world and a more creative future for the UnitedNations. It is with this in mind that I most warmlywelcome our new Member  Switzerland  and soon also Timor-Leste. These two new Members illustrate veryclearly all the disparities in our globalized world. Ifirmly believe that their work in this Assembly willhelp transform the United Nations into a communityfor the entire world."
"160",6548,"SWE",57,2002,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on your election as President.All speakers in this debate have reflected on theyear that has passed since 11 September 2001. It hasbeen a very dramatic year  and it is time for theinternational community to draw some conclusionsfrom it. One thing is clear: the United Nationsresponded quickly and resolutely to the terrorist actsagainst the United States. The United Nations actedwith speed and determination to counter that threat toglobal security.For me  that is yet further proof that the UnitedNations is  indeed  indispensable. We all know whatthe terrorists want: to hurt open societies  to replacecooperation with confrontation and to bring downdemocracy. But we can never let the terrorists prevailin their ambition. Nor can we tolerate the suppressionof political opposition or the persecution of religious orethnic minorities under the guise of combatingterrorism. In fact  it is by ensuring global respect forinternational law  human rights and social justice thatwe take away much of the fertile ground of terrorism.8The struggle against terrorism proves once againthat multilateral action and a global response are theonly sustainable means to meet common challenges.Fighting terrorism and building peace requireglobal cooperation. The Secretary-General said lastweek that when States decide to use force to deal withbroader threats to international peace and security  there isno substitute for the unique legitimacy provided by theUnited Nations. That is true also in the case of Iraq. Thedefiance of Iraq in the face of the Security Council mustcome to an end. At the heart of the issue lies the questionof weapons of mass destruction. They are weapons thatcan bring suffering and death to millions of people including those far away from Iraq.We want to be sure that Iraq fulfils its obligationto halt all programmes for developing such weapons.We also want to make sure that any weapons of massdestruction that may already have been developed arenow destroyed. That is the task of the United Nationsweapons inspectors. I welcome the announcement thatIraq is willing to let the inspectors return  withoutconditions. This time Iraq has to cooperate fully withthe United Nations. That will also be the right way togo to achieve the suspension of the sanctions.If that does not happen  however  and if Iraq'sdefiance continues  as the Secretary-General said  theSecurity Council must face its responsibilities. Thatcould be a very delicate decision for the Council; itwould need to weigh the risks of various options. Butthe credibility of the United Nations requires that Iraqbe made to fulfil its obligations.Sustainable development requires globalcooperation. Throughout the world  poverty andoppression can be exploited by extremists and can giverise to conflict and war. Global cooperation is neededto prevent that from happening. International securityand regional stability require the building ofdemocracy  respect for human rights  povertyeradication and sustainable development.Globalization makes it clear that socialresponsibility is required not only of Governments  butalso of companies and individuals — in short  of all of us.Ecological sustainability is the basis for humansurvival. Development and the environment areinterlinked. In Johannesburg  our nations made acommitment to translate into reality the Rio vision —the mutually supportive integration of environmentaland development goals.The launch of the Doha development agendaopens the way for an equitable and responsive globaltrading system. New global partnerships have changedthe way we look at patterns of production  consumptionand sustainable development  but the goals we have setmust be achieved. At Monterrey our commonresponsibility was confirmed. Strong and efficientinstitutions are needed at the local  regional andinternational levels to carry out these commitments. Weneed coherence and consistency. We need ownership.One of the most serious new threats to security isHIV/AIDS. Efforts to achieve sustainable developmentwill be in vain if we fail in our fight against HIV/AIDSand other diseases that still hold entire populations toransom. When the fundamental structures of societies arecrumbling due to the devastating effects of epidemics  wemust recognize that as a threat to global security.The Millennium Declaration is our referenceguide. Sweden fully supports the Secretary-General'sinitiative to launch a strategy for the successfulattainment of the Millennium Development Goals.Reaching those goals would in itself be the best way toprevent violent conflict. Behind the immediatesymptoms of conflict  we often find deep-rootedstructural causes.Even now  however  much more can be achievedif diplomatic  economic and military means are used ina coordinated way. Regional organizations  incooperation with the United Nations  have an importantrole to play  and the implementation of the Secretary-General's report (A/55/985) on the prevention of armedconflict is crucial in this respect.Ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requiresglobal cooperation. There is an urgent need to put anend to the occupation and to the spiral of terrorist acts violence and confrontation that have caused so muchsuffering and bloodshed in the Middle East.I deeply regret the two recent terrorist attacks inIsrael. I strongly urge both parties not to let the peaceprocess be held hostage by extremists.The future of the region depends on a peaceful sustainable and just solution being reached  based oninternational law and the relevant United Nationsresolutions. One way to achieve this is presented in theroad map recently adopted by the European Union 9building on the proposal from the Arab League meetingin Beirut. The road map includes the holding ofelections in the Palestinian territories in January 2003 aiming at the establishment of a peaceful anddemocratic Palestinian State in 2005. The rights ofIsrael and Palestine to security and statehood cannot besecured by military means. They can be secured onlyby negotiation.Safeguarding human rights requires globalcooperation. Addressing this issue  I wish to begin bypaying tribute to Mrs. Mary Robinson  the outgoingUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.Through her strong commitment  she has had animpact. She has made a difference  and we are gratefulto her. I warmly welcome her successor  Mr. SergioVieira de Mello  and assure him of our continuedcooperation and support.All human beings are born free and equal indignity and in rights. Still  vast numbers of women men and children all over the world are deprived oftheir declared  inherent and universal human rights.Harassment  torture and killings take place daily including through abhorrent practices such as genitalmutilation and stoning. Sometimes the reason for aperson's being abused is his or her gender  religion beliefs  sexual orientation  or the fact that he or she isdisabled. We have a duty to act against discrimination.The principles of non-discrimination and diversity arefundamental to a humane and decent society. Thesovereignty of States must never be used as a shieldbehind which violations of human rights take place.The General Assembly has taken the first step toestablish an international convention to promote andprotect the rights and dignity of persons withdisabilities. This is a very welcome development.The Secretary-General's report (A/57/169) onhow to eliminate violence against women and girlscommitted in the name of honour is another significantcontribution. Legal  protective and other preventivemeasures for women and girls at risk should beaddressed in a concerted manner.Human rights are often spoken about  but we alsoneed to put power behind the words. The creation of theInternational Criminal Court is a remarkable achievementin the progressive development of international law. Itsfundamental purpose is to eliminate impunity for crimesagainst humanity  genocide and war crimes. We all needto carefully safeguard the integrity of the Rome Statute sothat its object and purpose will not be undermined. Therights of every individual must be respected  and everyindividual  irrespective of nationality or position insociety  must be held responsible for his or her actions.Disarmament of weapons of mass destructionrequires global cooperation. International  as well asnational  security depends on strong multilateralframeworks. Our task is to implement and reinforce theimportant international conventions banning orregulating weapons of mass destruction. A verificationregime is necessary to strengthen the Biological andToxin Weapons Convention. Failure to reach concreteprogress at the Review Conference in November willhave serious consequences.The Chemical Weapons Convention provides forthe destruction of a whole category of weapons of massdestruction. That is true disarmament  and it should beimplemented in a full and timely manner. TheConvention will be reviewed in April of next year  forthe first time in its young history.Implementing the agreements made at the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review conferences is offundamental importance. That is particularly true forthe unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weaponStates to accomplish the total elimination of their nucleararsenals  and 12 other steps towards accomplishing thatgoal. As part of the New Agenda Coalition  Sweden willcontinue to contribute to this process.The disarmament process should also encompassnon-strategic nuclear weapons  as confirmed at the lastNPT Review Conference. It is vital that theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty enter intoforce. I call upon all States to adhere to that Treaty.The Conference on Disarmament must startsubstantive work when it resumes its session early nextyear. It is unacceptable that a few countries continue toblock progress. Sweden  Algeria  Belgium  Chile andColombia recently presented a proposal for aprogramme of work that takes into consideration theinterests of all parties. I urge China and the UnitedStates to actively work for a solution.The challenges ahead of us are neither fewer thanlast year nor smaller in magnitude. To face them  we needa modern and more efficient United Nations. A modernUnited Nations requires a Security Council that reflectsthe realities of today's international relations. We need tointensify efforts to achieve comprehensive reform of the10Security Council. That issue has been discussed for manyyears  with little success. In the end  it is a question ofthe credibility and legitimacy of the Organization.Sweden favours enlargement of the SecurityCouncil to make room for increased representation ofMember States  not least developing States. We wouldlike to see such a reform have the broadest possiblesupport. If this entailed  as a first step  an enlargementlimited to non-permanent members  while notexcluding new permanent members at a later stage Sweden would support such a solution. An immediateincrease would better reflect the realities of today'sinternational community and the growing number ofMember States.Let me finish by greeting Switzerland  one of thehost countries of the United Nations and warmlywelcoming it as a full Member of the United Nations.Shortly  the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste  acountry where this Organization has been deeply andpositively involved  will also become a new member ofthe United Nations family. I see significance in this. Isee proof that joint and integrated efforts by theinternational community can produce remarkableresults. It fills me with hope that the United Nationshas  in fact  entered this millennium with vigour anddetermination.I am convinced that the United Nations is on theright track. Through joint efforts by all of us  theUnited Nations will continue to be a beacon of hope forhumanity in the twenty-first century."
"161",6586,"SWZ",57,2002,"﻿It is an honour for meto address the General Assembly on behalf of thedelegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland. I bring withme the warm greetings and best wishes of His MajestyKing Mswati III  Her Majesty the Indlovukazi  theGovernment and the whole Swazi nation to allmembers of the United Nations family.The Kingdom of Swaziland joined the rest of theworld in sadness to commemorate the first anniversaryof the monstrous acts that took place in September lastyear. Our hearts once again reached out to all thosewho suffered on that fateful day here in New York andelsewhere in the United States  and to all those whoselives have been affected by subsequent events aroundthe world.In the aftermath of 11 September  the world isunderstandably preoccupied with the question ofsecurity and the war against terror. The Kingdom ofSwaziland reiterates its strong commitment to do all inits power to support the global alliance againstterrorism  and is determined to ensure that no aspect ofterrorism  including its financing and organization may be permitted to take root within our borders.The progress made in some areas of Africa is partof a general trend of optimism that is spreading amongall the countries on our continent. We cannot deny thatthere remain many serious challenges to address  bothin terms of conflict situations and in terms of overalldevelopment. We have placed our trust in the AfricanUnion to be the vehicle for this shift away from theunderdevelopment of the past  and the Kingdom ofSwaziland looks forward to working with its fellowmembers to make the new body one that will trulyaddress the challenges and make a real difference in thelives of our peoples.Of crucial importance to the success of theAfrican Union is the role of the developed world inliving up to its commitments to the continent and to allin the developing world.The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to developpeacefully and quietly  according to the aspirations andexpectations of its people. Our relationship with theinternational community remains founded on theprinciples of peaceful coexistence with all  on theresolution of all disputes through peaceful dialogue and on mutual respect and due regard for thesovereignty of independent nations. We value ourmembership in the United Nations and otherinternational  regional and subregional organizations.Our cooperation and friendship with other countries ofthe world give us an important instrument throughwhich we can address our national economic  socialand humanitarian concerns. Of particular importanceare our access to international markets for our goodsand the attraction of foreign direct investment: both arecentral to our efforts to improve our economy and toprovide jobs for our people.Poverty alleviation remains our number-onepriority. Sixty-six per cent of our people are livingbelow the internationally recognized poverty line  andyet our classification as a lower-middle-incomecountry denies us many of the funds and resources thatare available to those in other categories. We will beworking with the United Nations to ensure that thatsituation is corrected.In the meantime  we are focusing all our effortsand available resources on programmes that meet thechallenge of poverty in a sustainable and equitablemanner. Our national development strategy  which isthe result of direct consultation with the peoplethemselves  provides us with a blueprint forGovernment action and conforms precisely to theprinciples of Agenda 21.10Despite all our best efforts and our limitedsuccess in many areas  we are restricted in our capacityto meet our objectives  not only by our lack of accessto development funds  but also by a multitude ofproblems that are affecting us simultaneously and thatwe cannot overcome on our own. As is the case with alldeveloping countries  we are particularly at risk intimes of global economic difficulties and are especiallyvulnerable to disease and to the effects of changingweather patterns.Overshadowing all our development challenges however  is the threat posed by multiple health risks including malaria and tuberculosis  but especiallyHIV/AIDS. AIDS continues to claim the lives of hugenumbers of Swazis  and no family in our Kingdom hasescaped the deadly touch of that disease. No sector ofdevelopment is immune from the consequences of thevery high and increasing HIV infection rates amongour people  with enormous strain placed on ourfinancial and human resources in the battle to cope.We are trying our best in the light of our limitedresources. A national emergency response committeeon HIV/AIDS has been established to provide the focusfor our efforts. We are attacking the enemy on variousfronts  with priority placed on prevention  care counselling and treatment. Perhaps the greatest tragedyis the effect on children who have lost their parents tothe disease. We are battling to provide thoseunfortunate orphans with the means to continue normallives  especially with regard to food  clothing andschooling.We are ready to embrace approved strategies ofmedical care  including those that reduce mother-to-child transmission of the virus  and the prescription ofanti-retrovirals for those who need them. However  thesimple fact is that we cannot afford those costly drugs and we must rely on the sympathy and support ofothers. That is why the Kingdom was encouraged bythe expressions of commitment at last year's AIDSSummit and by the creation of the Global Fund to FightHIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. With our hopeshigh for support from the Fund  it came as a gravedisappointment to our people that our application to theFund earlier this year had been rejected and that thecriteria for selection of projects had become unclear.We earnestly hope that our second application willmeet with approval and that international support fromthat resource  and from those of all who pledged theirsolemn commitments  may at last be forthcoming tohelp us in this national disaster.In the meantime  we look to our own resources tofight the battle. One answer lies in the rediscovery ofpractices that are within our own traditions and culture.We have resurrected the rites of chastity and respect forself that served our people well for many generationsin the past  and these are finding increasing acceptancein our nation  especially among the younger generation.As we announced last year  His Majesty has alsoreached out to the international entertainmentcommunity for support  and we have beenoverwhelmed by the positive and heart-warmingresponse. Next month will see the release of an albumof music from international artists  entitled “Songs forLife”  whose proceeds will go entirely to HIV/AIDSprogrammes in southern Africa. We look forward withgreat confidence to the success of the album  with itsaims of promoting global awareness of the crisis inmany countries and of raising funds on a scale that willhelp those of us most affected to cope with its dreadfulconsequences.At precisely this moment of maximumdisadvantage  the Kingdom of Swaziland and others inthe southern African region have been hit hard by foodshortages that are affecting 21 per cent of our people largely as a result of lack of rain. We have been warnedthat the situation will deteriorate further next seasonwith the likely advent of the El Niño effect.Furthermore  the food security situation has beenexacerbated by other problems  such as the lack ofclean drinking water in rural areas and the prevalenceof HIV/AIDS-related illnesses and deaths  which leavefamilies with severely diminished resources to meettheir basic needs.Using our scarce resources  we are making everyeffort to help our people  and we have made one of ourtop priorities the construction of dams throughout therural areas  where the crisis is the most serious. TheKingdom of Swaziland is grateful to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations agencies for theirefforts to address those problems through the launchingof a United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appealin response to the humanitarian crisis in southernAfrica. We are grateful for the response to the Appeal and we hope for increased support as the faminetightens its grip on us.We appreciate the direct involvement of theSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General on thehumanitarian crisis in our region  Mr. James Morris and we look forward to working with him  and with allour international friends and partners  who havealready been so generous with emergency food aid  tomake it through this latest crisis for the Swazi nation.The review of the Kingdom's constitutioncontinues  and the drafting stage is almost complete.The next phase will be the people's review of the draftdocument to ensure that their wishes have been met.That will be the final stage before the document isformally adopted. We trust that the internationalcommunity will respect the fact that this finaldocument  the product of extensive consultation withthe whole nation  will be the true expression of thewishes of the people themselves  and will serve theKingdom of Swaziland well for many generations tocome. We are grateful to all who have supported us inthis nation-building exercise.The Kingdom of Swaziland would like to extenda warm welcome to the United Nations newestMember  Switzerland  and soon-to-be Member EastTimor. There now remains just one group of peoplethat is denied the opportunity to participate in theactivities of the United Nations and its associatedagencies. I refer here to the 23 million inhabitants ofthe Republic of China on Taiwan  a sovereign State anda constructive member of the international community.These 23 million people have shown time andagain that they are willing and able to contribute to theinternational community. At this critical time in thehistory of the world  which is faced with the challengesof instability  under-development and economicdifficulties  we cannot afford to exclude from our jointefforts the resources and skills of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan. As a democratic  prosperous andpeace-loving nation  Taiwan has displayed herreadiness to assist the development challenges of herfriends and partners  and has intervened inhumanitarian crises across the globe. Taiwan needs theUnited Nations  and the United Nations needs Taiwan.We therefore appeal once more to our fellow Membersto recognize the right of the 23 million people of theRepublic of China on Taiwan to representation in theUnited Nations system  and to take the appropriatemeasures to achieve this objective.We are living in dangerous times. Global tensionand the possibility of wide-scale conflict threaten allthe hopes for a century of peace  stability andsustainable development that were expressed at ourMillennium Summit just two short years ago.Our strength as an Organization depends onconsultation and consensus among all Member Statesin matters that affect the whole world. The summitsand special sessions that we all attend at great cost arevaluable only insofar as we carry through theresolutions we arrive at and the commitments we make.The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that thefundamental principles on which the United Nationswas founded still present the best and only chance forhumankind to live and work in harmony with oneanother.The Kingdom of Swaziland here reaffirms herfull commitment to the founding Charter of ourOrganization and offers her fullest support to all itsactivities that have as their aim to make this world ofours safer  more equal and healthier for all its people.We look forward to working with the United Nationsand her associated agencies in the coming year  to helpus to meet the development challenges of our people."
"162",6661,"SYR",57,2002,"﻿It gives me great pleasure to congratulateMr. Jan Kavan on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I amconfident that the many posts he has occupied willfacilitate his task in leading the deliberations of theGeneral Assembly to their desired objectives. I alsoexpress our appreciation to his predecessor for theefforts he made to bring the deliberations of the fifty-sixth session to a successful conclusion.I would be remiss if I failed to express ourappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for hisefforts to preserve the principles and purposes of the12United Nations Charter. I wish him success as hestrives to contribute successfully to the just solution ofthe problems that the international community faces.I would also like wholeheartedly to welcomeSwitzerland as the long-awaited newest Member of theOrganization. We look forward to cooperating with itin promoting the principles of the United Nations andsafeguarding its Charter.This session of the General Assembly has beenconvened one year after the 11 September attacks which had an impact on the current internationalsituation. In the aftermath of the attacks  many graveissues remained unresolved  awaiting effectivesolutions  and many questions went unanswered. Thestate of confusion  incertitude and tension on theinternational scene results from the feeling of themajority of the world's people that they have lost theirorientation. This results from a tendency on the part ofsome to use practices that can be best characterized asunilateral  expressing an appetite for hegemony andmonopoly over the wealth of others.The Middle East region is a case in point. Afterdecades of struggle waged by the people of the regionto liberate themselves from colonialism and foreigndomination and to try to eliminate injustices resultingfrom the redrawing of maps and the enforcement ofartificial borders between them  the people of theregion are facing a more vicious attack today than theyfaced during earlier colonial periods.The Arab countries have condemned the attacksagainst the United States of America. They haveexpressed sympathy for the families of the victims.Nonetheless  a year after the event that was officiallylinked to the Al Qaeda organization and the Talibanmovement  the world wonders how those accusationswere re-channelled so as to be levelled against theArab countries to such a degree that some of them arebeing threatened  while none of them had anything todo with the attacks.The irony is starker since justification for theaccusation is usually linked to the presence of some AlQaeda elements in those countries or to the fact thatsuch elements are nationals of those countries  while itis public knowledge that elements of the Al Qaedaorganization are present in more than 60 countriesaround the world  including the United States ofAmerica  according to official American statements.Since the end of the Second World War  ourregion has witnessed a series of wars and destruction asa result of an Israeli approach based on occupation settlement building and the uprooting of hundreds ofthousands of Palestinians from their homeland. TheUnited Nations has made efforts to find a just solutionfor the Arab-Israeli conflict. To that end  the UnitedNations has adopted hundreds of resolutions that Israelhas refused to implement  in a stark challenge to thewill of the international community. Israel continues tooccupy the Golan  the West Bank and Gaza and parts ofLebanese territory.When the Arab countries unanimously launchedtheir peace initiative at the Beirut summit in March2002  Israel responded by launching a widescalemilitary attack against Palestinian cities  villages andcamps in the West Bank. Israel's defiance ofinternational legitimacy assumed proportions that havebeen condemned by international public opinion particularly when the Israeli Government refused toreceive the fact-finding mission to investigate thedetails of the massacre at the Jenin refugee camp.Israel has claimed that the crimes it has carriedagainst the Palestinian people under occupation havebeen carried out in self-defence and in the war againstterrorism. We see how Israel has manipulated the waragainst the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Inthat context  it is important to stress that silence in theface of such manipulation amounts to total disregardfor human values  as much as it is disregard fordefenceless Palestinian souls.Without going into details of the Israeli attacksand violations in which American weapons were used the only way out of the crisis faced by the peoples ofthe region is by making Israel abide by relevantSecurity Council resolutions  which thus far are 28 innumber. Is it reasonable for the world to request Iraq toimplement Security Council resolutions  while somehelp Israel remain above international law? It is indeedlegitimate for us to ask the United States to distanceitself from the aggressive Israeli practices and to applyto Israel the American law that prohibits the use ofAmerican weapons against a third party. It is indeedodd that the United States considers Israel to be actingin self-defence in occupied territories  which is not inkeeping with Security Council resolutions in whosedrafting and adoption the United States itself hasparticipated since the founding of the United Nations.13Just and comprehensive peace in our region canbe achieved only through the implementation ofresolutions of international legitimacy that stress theneed for Israel to withdraw from all the Arab territoriesoccupied since June 1967 and to safeguard thelegitimate rights of the Palestinian people  includingthe right to establish their independent State withJerusalem as its capital.Much has been said recently about the danger ofthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction andthe possibility that international terrorists mightacquire such weapons. As is well known  that danger isnot limited to one region. Rather  it exists in manyregions of the world. It is regrettable that certainparties focus only on some Arab and Muslim countries and not on others  ignoring in the meantime Israel'snuclear arsenal. All the countries of the region haveexpressed  year after year  their readiness to make theMiddle East region a zone free of all weapons of massdestruction — nuclear  chemical and biological.Today more than ever before  we call for urgentand serious efforts to make our region free of allweapons of mass destruction  under the supervision ofthe United Nations. We declare from this rostrum thatall the Arab countries are prepared to establish such azone  provided that Israel will agree to establish such azone and to submit all its nuclear facilities to thesafeguards system of the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA)  as have the other Middle East  Araband Muslim countries of the region.The majority vote that Syria won upon submittingits candidacy for membership to the Security Councilhighlights the appreciation of these countries forSyria's constructive role in supporting the UnitedNations.It is well known that Syria has always been in theforefront of countries whose respect for internationallegitimacy constitutes a principled position in theirforeign policy. We agree with the Secretary-Generalabout the necessity of avoiding unilateral measures andresorting instead to working within the framework ofthe United Nations  which represents internationallegitimacy.In that light  we see no justification for igniting anew war in the Middle East. We strongly believe thatstriking Iraq  which no longer occupies the land ofothers  while keeping silent about the Israelioccupation of the Arab territories occupied since 1967 represents blind bias and a distorted vision of the realsituation in the Middle East.The international community is committed to theunity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. Wecannot recall anyone doubting that commitment. Wealso stress that it is the right of the Iraqi people aloneto decide their future without any interference in theirinternal affairs. It is the duty of all Members of ourOrganization to commit themselves to theimplementation of United Nations resolutions. Inkeeping with that commitment  Syria supports theresumption of dialogue between Iraq and the Secretary-General with the objective of reaching a politicalsolution that meets the requirements of the SecurityCouncil and that grants Iraq hope of peace  securityand the lifting of the sanctions imposed on it especially as Iraq has officially recognized the State ofKuwait and its international borders.Syria has expressed its satisfaction at positivedevelopments in the African continent. We areconfident that the establishment of the African Unionwill have a positive impact on the present and future ofthat continent and on solving the urgent problems itfaces. In that regard  we look forward with true hope tothe implementation of agreements recently signed bythe parties concerned to end the fighting in Angola Congo and the Great Lakes region.Syria also expresses its satisfaction at theincreasing international support to end the embargoagainst Cuba.Syria further welcomes the high-level talksbetween the Democratic People's Republic of Koreaand the Republic of Korea and expresses the hope thatthis rapprochement between the two Koreas will helpachieve the aspirations of the people of the Koreanpeninsula by peaceful means.The Syrian Arab Republic hopes that peace andstability will prevail in Afghanistan in the interest ofthe Afghan people  who have long suffered thescourges of war and internal strife.Syria supports the efforts of the Government ofthe Sudan to preserve the unity and territorial integrityof the Sudanese people and calls for a ceasefire in the14south of Sudan as a prelude to the resumption ofdialogue.Syria supports the Artah agreement reached bythe Somalis and deems it the most viable solution forachieving national reconciliation in Somalia.The world's peoples are passing through adifficult test at this critical juncture; the choices ofeven big and influential countries  are getting narrowerrather than broader due to the absence of a just worldorder. It is to be regretted that the voices of those whocall for war rise above the voices of those who call forpeace and that those who usurp the rights of people andencroach on their dignity are drowning out the voicesof those who defend the rights of people regardingtheir territory and freedom.But despite this grim picture  right will  in thefinal analysis  triumph over injustice. That is thecorrect reading of the history of nations andcivilizations; there is no going back. Arab Syria'sbelief in its rights and the rights of other nations cannotbe shaken or undermined by hegemony and thearrogance of power. We are convinced of thepossibility of building a world in which all coexist inpeace and security  a world free of occupation andhegemony  a world in which all peoples equally sharethe resources of our globe and the fruits of science andtechnology in order to achieve prosperity for all."
"163",6706,"TCD",57,2002,"﻿At theoutset  I should like  on behalf of all the members ofthe Chadian delegation that I have the honour to lead and on my own behalf  to warmly congratulate Mr. JanKavan on his election to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Indischarging that heavy responsibility  he can count onmy delegation's full availability and supportthroughout this session  all the more so since theinternational community has honoured my country byelecting it to one of the prestigious posts of Vice-President of the Assembly. I take this opportunity toexpress our gratitude to the Members of theOrganization for the trust placed in my country  Chad.Members may be assured that we shall do our utmost todeserve that trust.My thanks and congratulations go also toMr. Kavan's predecessor and to his team for the workaccomplished during the fifty-sixth session.I should also like to pay particular and well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  whose commitment and ceaseless efforts toachieve sustainable peace and development in theworld are welcome and should be recognized. Lastly  I express my sincere and warmcongratulations to the Swiss Confederation on itsadmission to the Organization. Chad  which enjoysclose relations of friendship and cooperation with thatcountry  welcomes its decision to join the great UnitedNations family. A country devoted to democratic andpeaceful values  Switzerland will undoubtedlycontribute to enriching our debates on all issues.The current session is taking place one year afterthe terrible attacks perpetrated against the UnitedStates of America on 11 September 2001  whichplunged American families and those of other nationsinto mourning. The Government and the people ofChad once again join the rest of the internationalcommunity in paying tribute to the memory of thethousands of innocent victims of that act of blindsavagery  which nothing can justify.Unfortunately  those sad events have brutallyalerted us to the numerous challenges that weabsolutely must face if we wish to one day bring abouta just and equitable international society that enableseach of its members to develop fully. In addition  thoseacts of despair can be checked only if their roots —which are nourished by unequal international relationsbroadening daily the gap between rich and poor — areeradicated. My country firmly condemns that form ofpolitical expression  from whatever side it may come and is ready to associate itself with any initiative of theinternational community to establish a new world orderbased on democracy and sustainable development.Today  the United Nations is called on more thanever to help to establish a fairer and more prosperousinternational society. We note with satisfaction theOrganization's frequent efforts to ultimately eradicatethe scourges of disease and malnutrition — in short those of underdevelopment. In that regard  numerousworld meetings at the level of heads of State orGovernment have been organized under the auspices ofthe United Nations or of specialized agencies with aview to implementing the decisions andrecommendations of the Millennium Summit. But thepoint is not to have Summits; above all  we must matchwords with deeds.The Republic of Chad  like all other developingStates  aspires to a better life and well-being for itspopulation. His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby rightlystated  in his inaugural address on 8 August 2001  thathis mandate would have the double aims of peace andeconomic progress. In order to do that  Chad is relyingon the early exploitation of its mineral and agriculturalwealth. We take this opportunity to inform theAssembly and to reassure the international community including the friends of Chad  that the work to carryout its oil project is proceeding under good conditions.According to forecasts  the first barrels of oil may bebrought to market starting in July 2003.However  despite the prospects offered to Chadby the oil age  the Government is aware of theweakness of the national economic structures  of thedebt burden and of the imbalances that make thepopulation's living conditions precarious. Once again we call for our bilateral and multilateral partners toincrease their assistance and simply to cancel externaldebt  as the African Union has always recommended.Long captive to its domestic problems  theRepublic of Chad  now more than ever before  intendsto shoulder its responsibilities within the internationalcommunity  particularly on the level of the African13continent. Therefore  the Government is committed tohelping to make the African Union — whose birth wascelebrated on 9 July 2002 at Durban  South Africa — agenuine instrument of the continent's political andeconomic integration. The New Partnership forAfrica's Development (NEPAD) is part of that majorobjective. In the framework of North-South and South-South cooperation  NEPAD deserves the support ofAfrica's development partners.But again  Chad is among those who think thatAfrica's salvation lies in the hands of Africansthemselves. To that goal  they must take courageouspolitical decisions and transcend their differences sothat the African Union can become a reality  becausethe disruptions and crises of all kinds suffered by thatgreat and rich continent are sources of serious anxiety.However  the latest news coming from variousAfrican subregions allow us to believe that an end toconflicts is in sight on the continent. Since thebeginning of this year  several meetings of nationalreconciliation have taken place and several peaceagreements have been signed  including in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  in Angola  inBurundi  in Sudan  in Sierra Leone and in Somalia.That offers real hope for African populations. Chadintends to fully commit itself to ensure that that hope isrealized.Along with other members of the internationalcommunity  the Chadian Government is concerned atthe situation that continues to prevail in the MiddleEast. Unfortunately  that intolerable situation resultsfrom non-compliance with the relevant resolutions ofthe Security Council and of the General Assembly. Inthe light of its obligation to be fair to all Members ofthe Organization  the Council should ban any policy ofdouble standards and should ensure respect for itsdecisions  in particular resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973) and 1397 (2002). Genuine peace in the MiddleEast demands that.Likewise  the Government of the Republic ofChad cannot remain silent on another situation ofinjustice that continues to preoccupy the Organization:its exclusion of the Republic of China on Taiwan. Thatissue comes back to us every year like a boomerangbecause we handled it badly more than 30 years ago.For us  as a result  it is a matter of conscience thatchallenges all of us to find a solution. We have statedon a number of occasions that it is not a question ofredressing one injustice by committing another;0 it issimply a question of giving back to the Republic ofChina on Taiwan  a democratic and responsiblesovereign State  and to its people the place they shouldhave on the international stage. This is why  onceagain  the Government of Chad calls for the admissionof The Republic of China on Taiwan to theOrganization.At its creation in 1945 the United Nations had 51Members. Now  almost 200 countries are full Membersof the Organization. This growth means that it is timefor an in-depth reform of its structures to allow forgreater participation by all Member States andincreased accountability for the taking of internationaldecisions that have a definite impact on the life of allour citizens. This is because globalization should notbe regarded only as economic  but also as political.Thus  Chad feels that the restructuring of theUnited Nations is essential and should focus on thefollowing two points: first  strengthening the role of theGeneral Assembly in order to make it more democraticand more active in decision-making; and secondly  anincrease in the number of the members of the SecurityCouncil in order to achieve better representation for allthe geographic areas of the world. Chad thereforeendorses that position  which is also that of the AfricanUnion.Before I conclude my statement I wish to call tomind a happy event which took place in my countryjust one year ago. In July 2001 a significant scientificdiscovery was made in the Djourab desert in the northof Chad  by researchers headed by a French-Chadianpaleontological mission. This was the discovery of thefossilized skull of a hominid known as Sahelanthropustchadensis  dating back approximately 7 million years.Sahelanthropus tchadensis  which means man of theChadian Sahel  has been nicknamed Toumai whichmeans hope of life in the local language. Study of theskull has indicated that this is a new human species  anew earliest member of humankind.This discovery has had a significant impact in thescientific community and in world public opinion because it challenges the many theories concerning theorigin of humankind. Toumai is the common ancestorof us all  and Chad is now regarded as the cradle ofhumankind. In order to mark this important discovery the Chadian Government envisions the establishmentof a department of paleontology to foster research and14education in this scientific discipline  as well as theconstruction of a museum to develop scientific tourismin Chad.My country will be relying on the support of theinternational community to carry out these projects inthe sphere of scientific research and paleontology inparticular. All present are warmly invited to visit Chad now known as the cradle of humankind  whose touristassets have thus been enhanced by this new scientificdiscovery."
"164",6752,"TGO",57,2002,"﻿Thepreservation of international peace and security  thefight against terrorism in all its forms  the eradicationof poverty throughout the world  the promotion ofsustainable development and the establishment of amore just and more human international order are thechallenges that we must strive to meet  primarilythrough the irreplaceable framework of the UnitedNations. We are meeting once again to find newperspectives in the light of the evolving internationalsituation in order to provide new impetus to our actionsby coming together around common objectives.Before continuing my statement  allow me  onbehalf of the delegation of Togo and on my own behalf to address our warmest congratulations to Mr. Kavanon his election as President of the General Assembly atits fifty-seventh session. His election to that high postis a tribute not only to him personally  but also to hisgreat and beautiful country. I assure him of the fullestcooperation of my country towards the success of hismission.I also take this opportunity to convey to hispredecessor our full gratitude for the effective way inwhich he led the work of the previous session.To Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who workstirelessly to strengthen peace and security throughoutthe world  we reiterate our high appreciation of hiscommitment and dedication.I congratulate Switzerland and Timor-Leste ontheir admission into the great United Nations family.Democracy  respect for fundamental freedomsand human rights and good governance are factors indevelopment and peace and values to which Togo haslong adhered and to which we are deeply attached. It isin the spirit that we must consider the political reformsthat were launched 15 years ago at the initiative of ourHead of State. These reforms seek to build a peacefuldemocracy based on the widest possible nationalconsensus and rooted in the historical and socio-cultural realities of our country.Today  our efforts have led to the establishmentand effective operation of almost all the institutionscalled for in the Constitution of the Fourth Republic  tothe restoration of State authority and security and to therevitalization of the national economy. We haveachieved these results despite the difficulties thathindered the process of democratization as a result of apoorly begun transition  and despite all kinds ofmanoeuvres and obstacles constantly set up by anunhelpful opposition. Priority has been placed aboveall on the continuation of political reforms to ensurethat they are undertaken in a climate of restored calmand ongoing concertation among all the political forcesof our nation.It was in this context that  at the initiative of theHead of State  Mr. Gnassingbé Eyadema  we launchedan inter-Togolese dialogue among all the country'sprincipal political actors that led to the signing of aframework agreement in July 1999. Theimplementation of that agreement allowed theestablishment of a dialogue between the Governmentand the opposition on such essential political questionsas the organizational modalities of early legislativeelections.It was the will of the Head of State and of theGovernment to ensure that these elections  open to allpolitical groups without exception  should take place ina climate of peace and security  with the necessaryguarantees of transparency and legality. It is also ouraim that  at the completion of this electoral process  anew phase should begin in our country's political life7with the revitalization of a National Assembly in whichpolitical groups that wish to be represented can be so.All of these achievements  which strengthenpolitical pluralism in Togo  deserve the support andencouragement of our partners  particularly those inEurope  with a view to normalizing our relations ofcooperation. Unfortunately  that has not been the case.As I stressed a year ago from this very rostrum  thepeople of Togo do not deserve the treatment they havereceived. It is now clear that the rash imposition ofsanctions as a means of political pressure entails limitsbeyond which such measures become ineffective andrun counter to morality and to the duty of internationalsolidarity.I wish once again to launch an urgent appeal forthe resumption of the cooperation that Togo has a rightto expect from the international community as an act ofsolidarity  support and encouragement for theindisputable efforts that have been made by myGovernment towards the development of the countryand the consolidation of the bases of our democracy ina climate of peace  stability and national harmony.It is well known that we in Togo have made peaceand national security our credo  given that noundertaking for sustainable development can besuccessfully carried out if the recourse to violenceprevails over dialogue  concertation and mutual respectand if the world continues to face such terrorist acts asthe tragedy of 11 September 2001. Those terribleevents  which are still vivid in our minds  require us individually and collectively  to respond appropriatelyto the threats represented by terrorism. Togo  which hasbeen a repeated victim of terrorist aggression understands the importance of the challenge and sparesno effort in assuming its share of the responsibility inthis struggle.We must here welcome the speed with which theUnited Nations has reacted to this problem andcontributed to the emergence of an acute awareness ofthe phenomenon and the dangers it entails for allmankind. Today  as was the case a year ago  it isimperative that we recognize the urgency and need topursue this campaign. It is clear that we must seektogether the factors that will contribute to maintainingpeace in all its dimensions.Yes  crises and armed conflicts still afflict theworld  unfortunately  in Africa and elsewhere. While itmay be true that some glimmers of hope have emergedin Africa with the resolution of the conflict betweenEthiopia and Eritrea and with respect to the settlementof other crises  the situation remains alarming. It isalarming in the Great Lakes region and the Mano Riverregion  which is again experiencing a genuine securityproblem  with major humanitarian consequences.Whether we are talking about the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  the Mano river region  theSudan  Somalia or any other country affected by crises we reaffirm that only dialogue and negotiation can leadto peace and ensure the lasting settlement of disputes.We therefore urge the parties to such crises and armedconflicts to be more courageous and demonstrategreater political will so as to give peace a chancethrough negotiating processes already under way andby respecting and effectively implementing theprovisions of agreements that have already beensigned.In this respect  we welcome the recentannouncement of the withdrawal  beginning next week of Rwandan troops from the eastern part of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  and we hope thatthe implementation of this decision will strengthen theprocess under way.The situation in the Middle East also remainsworrying. We must find a solution to the vicious circleof violence — violence breeding violence. Togo hasalways stressed that violence can lead only to bitternessand resentment and that it further perpetuates violence.This cannot be said enough: dialogue and negotiationare the only means that should be used to settledisputes. We therefore strongly urge both Palestiniansand Israelis to end the vicious circle of violence andimmediately take up negotiations with a view toachieving a just  comprehensive and final settlement ofthe question of Palestine  which is at the heart of theconflict in the Middle East. Of course  such asettlement would require recognition of the legitimaterights of the Palestinian people  including their right toa viable Palestinian State. But it would also entail therecognition of the equally legitimate rights of theIsraeli people to live in peace and complete securitywithin internationally recognized borders.This session began just a few days after theconclusion of the World Summit on Sustainable8Development  at which the international communitystressed more than ever before the need to protecthumankind and the natural world. Now more than everwe must protect humankind in its multifacetedcharacter and the environment in all of its variety.I am pleased to note  too  that this session of theGeneral Assembly is taking place during a historic timefor our continent of Africa. Indeed  two years ago  on12 July 2000  at Lomé  Togo  African countries laid thegroundwork for a new Africa by adopting  before thewhole world  the Constitutive Act of the AfricanUnion. The African heads of State or Governmentsolemnly launched the new continent-wideorganization at Durban in July  thereby translating intoreality their determination to shape a new destiny forAfrica.Some might be tempted to say that  despite theestablishment of the African Union  nothing decisivewill be done and that the continent will still be tryingto find itself while stagnating in underdevelopment. Itis true that  given the current economic and socialsituation  such pessimism could be warranted. Indeed our continent of Africa is still the principal victim of aneconomic order that is out of balance and unfair — onethat all too often deprives it of the fruits of its ownlabour.Unstable commodity prices  yearly increases inthe price of crucial capital goods  debt  limited accessto the markets of industrialized countries for ourfinished and semi-finished goods and the competitionwith which our products have to contend as a result ofthe export subsidy policies of certain rich countries —policies that benefit their own industries — areseriously hampering the development of our countries.Today more than ever it is vital to ask how Africacan reconcile the repayment of its debt with theimplementation of its economic growth anddevelopment goals. Turning the current situationaround is a task that we must undertake throughreflection and action.The establishment of a new structure — theAfrican Union — marks a decisive turning point in thehistory of our continent  which  more than ever before needs the invaluable support of the internationalcommunity in carrying out its developmentprogrammes. We are aware that Africa cannot rise tothe challenge of growth and development unless itbecomes organized to mobilize and make the best useof its resources using external aid only as acomplement to its own efforts. We earnestly hope thatthe consolidation of various subregional organizationsfor economic integration  together with the synergisticimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment  will provide Africa with the means toachieve its ambitions.In conclusion  I should like to stress that the newinternational context and the multidimensional natureof the problems to be faced mean that we must workwith greater determination and solidarity within theUnited Nations in order to push back insecurity poverty and misery. In this regard  we must considerproviding this shared Organization with thewherewithal and the increased resources to enable it toachieve peace and economic and social developmentfor our peoples.That is the price to be paid for the future ofhumankind. I earnestly hope that the United Nationswill  more than ever before  become the ideal tool toimplement our ideals of peace  justice  progress andliberty for the benefit of our peoples."
"165",6797,"THA",57,2002,"﻿I would like  onbehalf of the Government and the people of Thailand to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you  Sir  uponyour election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. I am confidentthat  under your able leadership and guidance  thissession will build upon the momentum and efforts ofprevious endeavours and reach a fruitful conclusion.I also wish to commend your predecessor  Mr.Han Seung-soo  whose tireless efforts guided usthrough the past eventful year.We look forward to welcoming the DemocraticRepublic of Timor-Leste to the United Nations.Thailand is honoured to have actively participated inthe United Nations operations in East Timor from thevery beginning. Thailand's role in East Timor wasunique in linking the peacekeeping mission todevelopment and poverty eradication.I would also like to congratulate Switzerland onbecoming a new Member of the family of this worldbody. Switzerland is hardly a stranger to the UnitedNations system; its support has been long standing. Iam certain that the two new Members will furthercontribute to the universality and the work of theUnited Nations.As we remember  one year on  the horrendousterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001  we share thegrief and painful awareness of the impact of thatheinous crime on global security and stability. One yearon  we are still witnessing the development ofconflicts  threats of terrorism and the challenge of howto deal with errant members of the internationalcommunity. Indeed  the post-11-September world mustrely much more on the role of the multilateralmechanism to promote peace  security and prosperityin the international community. More than ever before today's terrorism continues to be a threat to humansecurity and global economic stability.As the Secretary-General so rightly said  thattragic incident and its repercussions required a broad sustained and global response. Thailand fully endorseshis call for the international community to usemultilateral institutions effectively to respond to theglobal scourge of terrorism. Thailand condemnsterrorism and supports all United Nations actionsagainst it. Moreover  the Thai Government isdetermined to push ahead with the necessary steps  interms of its domestic legislation and regulations  so asto enable Thailand to become a party to all theinternational conventions relating to terrorism. We areworking closely with the Counter-Terrorism Committeeto implement Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).There is to date no indication whatsoever that there isany trace of terrorist capability in Thailand. We aremaking sure that no terrorist activities or networks canbe harboured in our territory.The Association of South-East Asian Nations andUnited States Joint Declaration for Cooperation toCombat International Terrorism also demonstrates ourcommon and regional resolve to fight terrorism.Obviously we cannot take peace for granted. Theuncontrolled spread of small arms and light weaponsand the proliferation of nuclear weapons and otherweapons of mass destruction are growing threats toworld peace and security. The indispensable role of theUnited Nations in maintaining international peace andsecurity must gain support from every member of thecommunity.In order to prevent the proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction and pave the way for theirreduction and eventual elimination  the multilateralsecurity system must be effectively complied with. Inthis regard  we urge Iraq to comply with the relevantSecurity Council resolutions unconditionally andunreservedly  in accordance with its responsibilities. Atthe same time  we are also convinced that diplomaticefforts  undertaken within the United Nationsframework  are desirable and will be the most effectivemeans of reaching a favourable solution and sopreventing the escalation of this crisis. Therefore while we view as a positive development yesterday'sletter to the Secretary-General  undertaking to allowUnited Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq  we together with other nations  expect Iraq fully to live upto the solemn undertaking that it has given to the worldbody.While effective multilateral mechanisms are thekey to the maintenance of international peace andsecurity  it is also the responsibility of each and everymember of the international community to bring aboutand uphold peace. It is also the responsibility of eachand every State to ensure that peace  once restored  willlast.In this regard  Thailand is honoured to be hostingthe current peace negotiations between the Governmentof Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 19being held from 16 to 18 September. We hope tofacilitate the peace talks with a view to bringing alasting solution to this longstanding conflict and toending the suffering that has resulted.As part of the reconstruction efforts inAfghanistan  Thailand has pledged to share itsexperience and knowledge in the reduction of opiumcultivation through the crop substitution programmeunder the renowned project sponsored by His Majestythe King. That is part of the global effort to sustainpeace in Afghanistan  as the scourge of drugs threatenspeace and stability.The current Thai Government  under theleadership of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra  isdetermined to see the Thai people enjoy the benefits offreedom from fear and want. Human security hastherefore been declared one of the Government's mostimportant policies. Thailand believes that we will beone of the first countries in the world to set up aministry of human security for that specific purpose.The ministry is due to be inaugurated next month.Thailand is also proud to be one of the 13 members ofthe Human Security Network  whose work is wellunder way.The scourge of drugs deprives our people of bothfreedom from fear and freedom from want  and povertyremains a major threat to human security. Since takingup office early last year  the current Thai Governmenthas waged war against drugs and poverty with theresolute determination to win. We are not doing italone. Our partnerships to tackle the global threat ofdrugs  partnerships formed within bilateral  regionaland international cooperative frameworks  such as theUnited Nations International Drug ControlProgramme  have been fruitful. An initiative ofThailand  the quadrilateral cooperation among China Laos  Myanmar and Thailand to prevent and suppressthe production and trafficking of drugs is makingprogress  particularly in combating the spread ofmethamphetamines. The leaders of our four countrieswill meet at an appropriate time to provide much-needed political impetus at the highest level.The issue of HIV/AIDS is another majortransnational threat to human security. Thailand hasforged partnerships with its neighbouring countries particularly the greater Mekong subregion  as well as apartnership with related United Nations agencies andwith the members of the Human Security Network totackle this global epidemic. At the XV InternationalConference on AIDS  to be hosted by Thailand in2004  we hope to share our experiences in addressingthe multifaceted aspects of HIV/AIDS  namely prevention  treatment  care and support  as well asresearch and development.Even if the war against poverty is Thailand'smajor priority  the eradication of poverty is not anycountry's exclusive agenda. Rather  it is an agenda forall mankind. The United Nations millenniumdevelopment goals have rightly placed the interests andwelfare of the people at the core of socio-economicdevelopment. Since their adoption  several eventsunder the United Nations framework have taken placeto ensure sustainable development.Our children must inherit the world in at least noworse a shape than it is in today  if not a better andmore livable one.From Brussels to Doha and Monterrey toJohannesburg  the resolve and commitment of theinternational community to advance towards achievingthe millennium development goals for sustainabledevelopment have been clearly mobilized. TheMonterrey consensus has provided a road map forfostering more effective partnership and greater policycoherence amongst Governments and financial andtrade institutions. The international trade and financialenvironment must be developed to better servesustainable development.Greater market access for developing countries'exports forms part and parcel of making the Doharound a truly development round. The G8's decision toresist protectionist pressure is a positive step forward.Equally important is the role of foreign directinvestment  which requires rechannelling in order notonly to meet the development goals of the host country but also to promote investors' corporate accountabilityand social responsibility.The World Summit on Sustainable Developmentin Johannesburg was  indeed  a historic event. Thailandgladly welcomes the adoption of the PoliticalDeclaration and the Plan of Implementation particularly their emphasis on poverty reduction  whichbinds the three pillars of sustainable development. TheSummit underscored a range of principles  such as self-help and common but differentiated responsibilities  tomake sustainable development a reality for mankind.Enhanced coordination and coherence amongst20Governments  international organizations and otherstakeholders are crucial to providing the necessarysynergies in achieving our common goals.The principle of partnership as enunciated atMonterrey and echoed at the World Summit onSustainable Development is being implemented.Thailand is proud to be cited as one of the concreteexamples of countries that have succeeded in theircoordination and partnership efforts in capacity-building. As a result of the tenth session of the UnitedNations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD)  held in Thailand in 2000  the InternationalInstitute for Trade and Development (ITD) has beenestablished in Bangkok. ITD is a Thailand-UNCTADpartnership to enhance the productive capacity andtrade-negotiating skills of developing countries as theyprepare for the new round of global trade negotiations.Capacity-building is crucial if developingcountries are to participate effectively in defending andadvancing their interests both in bilateral andmultilateral free-trade arrangements  where increasingly  non-tariff barriers are often found in theguise of environmental measures. In this aspect  ITDcan serve as a useful linkage between UNCTAD  theWorld Trade Organization and the United NationsEnvironment Programme for capacity-building in tradenegotiation. Thailand urges Member States to considerthe best use of this Thailand-UNCTAD Institute.As an item on the world agenda  povertyeradication can never succeed unless there are genuineefforts at the neighbour  regional and global levels. TheMekong subregion is another example of self-help andpartnership among developing countries. The road mapfor opportunities to advance economic integration inthat subregion is now taking shape. The commercialroutes  the routes of economic opportunitiesproviding transportation linkages  are beingestablished with the partnership of donor countries andthe Asian Development Bank. From East to West from Viet Nam  Laos and Thailand to Myanmar andIndia  and from North to South  from southernChina  Myanmar and Laos to Thailand  these roadlinkages are now the new lifelines for the futureprosperity of the region. They will bring about accessto markets  capital and knowledge for sustainabledevelopment.Based on the same principle of creatingopportunities in the region for economic progress Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra took the initiative with the support and participation of 18 Asian nations to turn Asia's rich diversity into collective strength bycreating synergy from an Asia-wide partnership knownas the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD). Launched inJune this year  with its original members ranging fromthe West to the North-East of the Asian continent andwith its core principles of positive thinking  ACD isenvisaged as an evolving  informal  non-institutionalized  open  inclusive and incrementalprocess.ACD's strength is to build upon multiple layers ofstrategic partnerships in practical areas of cooperation such as the development of small and medium-sizedenterprises  tourism  transportation linkages agriculture and poverty eradication. We hope that ACDwill help enhance Asia's economic competitiveness open up business opportunities and make Asia astronger partner for both our developed and developingpartners. After the success of its inaugural ministerialmeeting in Cha-Am  Thailand  in June  Thailand willbe host once more to the ACD meeting next year tomove our cooperation forward.International and regional partnerships  as well ascommitments to sustainable development  are notenough. They must be reinforced by partnerships andpolicies at the national level. The goals and methodscontained in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementationare being pursued as part of our development strategy.The present Thai Government is pursuing adevelopment strategy of enhancing internationalcompetitiveness and domestic productivity throughmobilizing both domestic and external sources ofgrowth for balanced and sustainable development.This balanced development strategy has beeninspired by His Majesty the King of Thailand'sphilosophy of sufficiency economy'. The mainprinciple of this approach to development is adherenceto a middle path at the level of the individual  familiesand communities. This involves strengthening thegrass-roots economy to build its immunity against theadverse impact of global volatility  as well as toenhance its ability to benefit from the multilateraltrading system.Thailand places people at the forefront of itsdevelopment efforts. Their livelihood must entailhuman development and community participation. ThisGovernment is making progress in its programmes and21measures to improve the quality of life of the Thaipeople. They include the provision of health care forall  a three-year debt suspension for farmers  theestablishment of microcredit facilities  such as thePeople's Bank  for small entrepreneurs  and thelaunching of a village and urban revolving fund toprovide financial support for local initiatives. Inenhancing human potential and innovation  12 years offree education for all are guaranteed by ourConstitution. This goes along well with the recentrecommendation by the G8 Education Task Force oneducation in developing countries.As a result of lessons learned from past history the Charter of the United Nations prescribes themultilateral structure of this institution as the bestmeans to maintain international peace and security aswell as to advance social and economic developmentand prosperity. It remains the tasks and duties of thisinstitution and its Member States to continueperforming to achieve the Charter objectives. Peace however  cannot be enforced  but must be cultivatedthrough tolerance and respect for each other.Prosperity  on the other hand  cannot be obtainedwithout creating opportunities from the diversestrengths of each other. Those tasks and duties therefore  do not merely involve the compliance byeach Member State with the United Nationsmultilateral mechanism; they also include our forgingcooperation and partnership at all levels among allstakeholders. For its part  Thailand remains firmlycommitted to achieving global peace and prosperity byworking with other States regionally and universallywithin the United Nations framework. We have faiththat  ultimately  through this multilateral institution weshall build the world best suited for us and our childrento live peacefully and harmoniously."
"166",6822,"TJK",57,2002,"﻿It isa great pleasure to join in the heartfelt congratulationsaddressed to Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to the highpost of President of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. Undoubtedly  he will apply hisextensive professional and life experience to benefit9this General Assembly session  so that it will give freshimpetus to the efforts of our universal Organization.East Timor and Switzerland are new Membersthis year. The international community welcomes themwith joy. We congratulate the Governments and peoplesof those two friendly nations.Every year the issues the United Nations mustaddress become more challenging. The need for auniversal organization has become especially urgentover the past decade. It is understandable. The cold warhas ended and humanity has entered a new stage ofdevelopment.Addressing global issues and challenges throughcommon efforts has become a basic dimension of thatnew stage. Another distinctive feature is theconstructive nature of such efforts. A third dimensionis common understanding that all those efforts  coupledwith democratization of internal societies andinternational relations  should bring about improvedliving standards for Member States. The UnitedNations can and must play a significant role incoordinating national  regional and international effortsin the age of globalization.Tajikistan has been a Member State for the 10years of its new history. As the Tajik State was beingestablished  a fratricidal conflict was sweeping thecountry. However  over the past five years  peace andstability have prevailed in Tajikistan. Respect for Tajikhistory and traditions  human rights  an atmosphere oftolerance for diverse opinions and views and focus onmajor concerns of the nation are all fundamentalcomponents of the peace process in Tajikistan  whoselessons could be applied in resolving conflicts in otherhotspots of the world.Tajikistan  which suffered to achieve itsdemocracy  is creating today a secular society  has asubstantial foundation for its development and looks tothe future with optimism. That optimistic outlook isdetermined by President Emomali Rakhmonov'srational and carefully considered policy of establishinggood relations with Tajikistan's neighbours and by theassistance and support received from the internationalcommunity.The Tajik people extend special appreciation tothe United Nations  which  during the time of ourdifficult trials  demonstrated in the most effectivemanner its peacemaking and humanitarian capacities.The United Nations  working in close cooperation withthe Tajik Government  is showing in Tajikistan itscapacity to strengthen peace and stability. We aresatisfied with the performance of the United NationsTajikistan Office of Peace-building in our country andbelieve that the experience it gained in Tajikistan canbe used for the benefit of other States.The rehabilitation of the economy  the eradicationof poverty  increasing the living standard and jobcreation are the issues that are still referred to as ourcountry's most pressing problems. Tajikistan is a Statewhose social and economic development depends  to agreat extent  on the international community's commonand comprehensive approach to the issues ofcombating poverty  financing development  ensuring anequitable international trade system  eliminatingecological threats and resolving demographicproblems. In that context  we invariably favour furtherenhancement of the role of the United Nations as thecore international forum for developing such acommon approach.Over the past few months  the Member Stateshave achieved some progress in that area. Overall  webelieve the outcome of the International Conference onFinancing for Development in Monterrey was positive and we are looking forward to the implementation ofits resolutions.Environmental issues and issues of sustainabledevelopment are among the top-ranking items of theUnited Nations agenda and  appropriately  arebecoming a significant component of multilateraldiplomacy. The World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  recently held in Johannesburg was oneof the major events in that area. At the Summit  theworld's top policy makers analysed the progress madein the implementation of Agenda 21 over the past 10years. The concept of sustainable development thatemerged from the United Nations Conference onEnvironment and Development  in Rio de Janeiro in1992  was further elaborated and acquired newmeaningful content. The international community facesthe task of meeting the challenges established at theforum in Johannesburg. Accomplishing that task couldgive us hope that problems such as poverty eradication environmental protection and ensuring social equitycan be resolved in a comprehensive manner.It is our intention to make a viable contribution toimplementing the World Summit resolutions. We hope10that international cooperation in that area will fullyaccount for the specific conditions and economiccapacities of the countries from different groups particularly  the developing countries and countrieswith economies in transition.Over recent years we have witnessed a dynamicprocess in connection with the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change  the UnitedNations Convention on Biological Diversity and theUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.The number of Member States that ratified the KyotoProtocol and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety isincreasing. Interaction between countries in addressingdesertification and land degradation issues is gainingmomentum.Tajikistan has been an active participant in thoseimportant processes. We believe it is essential toconsistently continue coordination of theimplementation of the Conventions in order to avoidduplication and ensure effective allocation of limitedinternational resources.Among the most valuable assets of our planet arewater resources. They are at the core of both ecologicalbalance and economic prosperity. They are anindispensable prerequisite for food production improvement of social welfare and economic growth.However  even today many regions of the world face ashortage of fresh water. According to the Secretary-General  if current practices of water usage persist  by2025 two thirds of the world's population will be livingin a country experiencing so-called water stress.The urgency of the problem encouragedTajikistan to propose the initiative of proclaiming theyear 2003 the International Year of Freshwater. Webelieve that the preparation for that year and thevarious events planned within its framework  inparticular  the Third World Water Forum  to be held inJapan in March 2003  will give Member States a goodopportunity to exchange their expertise gained inapplying successful patterns of water-resourcemanagement and in searching for needed finances andresources.In putting forward the initiative for theInternational Year of Freshwater  we expected that themajor focus of the events to be held in 2003 would beon universal access to freshwater and diminishing thepossibility of conflicts related to water shortage. Thatwould make a specific and substantial contribution toachieving the goals of sustainable development.It is impossible to achieve the goals ofsustainable development unless the economiccomponent of globalization is given due attention anddiscrimination in economic relations is eliminated. Inan environment where wealthy countries benefit fromglobalization and continue to get richer  while poorcounties get poorer  social tensions increase and causepolitical extremism  including the most extremeform — namely  terrorism. Counteracting the threat ofterror is a long-term endeavour  since it is aphenomenon that is alien to human civilization  and itis multidimensional and deep-rooted. In addition touniting the will of all its participants  applying militaryresources and strengthening the international legalframework  the anti-terrorist coalition establishedfollowing 11 September 2001 must direct its effortstowards elimination of the primary reasons forterrorism  which can be traced to unsettled conflictsand outrageous social and economic inequities.Tajikistan is actively participating in the commoneffort to ensure a unified international legal frameworkfor combating terrorism. Our country has become aparticipant in the most universal anti-terroristconventions. We totally support the activities of theSecurity Council in this area. We highly appreciate therole of the Counter-Terrorism Committee that was setup in compliance with resolution 1373 (2001)  underthe leadership of Sir Jeremy Greenstock; thisCommittee has assumed a central role in theunprecedented effort to establish a global system tocounteract international terrorism. Pursuant to theauthority conferred on it by the United Nations Charter the Security Council will continue to play an activerole in preventing threats to international peace andsecurity posed by terrorism.It is essential to continue using all kinds ofpolitical  economic  financial and humanitarianmeasures in order to develop a comprehensiveapproach to the eradication of international terrorism.It is important that the development of fundamentalprinciples to combat terrorism be enhanced at theinternational legal level. In this connection  we expectthe General Assembly shortly to adopt acomprehensive convention on combating internationalterrorism  as well as to complete negotiating andadopting a comprehensive international convention oncombating acts of nuclear terrorism.We believe the time has come to convene aspecial session of the General Assembly in 2003 todiscuss all aspects of combating terrorism and to adoptconsolidated decisions. At that time  we could alsodiscuss the progress made over five years on theimplementation of the decisions of the twentiethspecial session dedicated to the illicit production  saleand trafficking of narcotics. In view of the ever-increasing drug threat  we regard the creation of ananti-narcotics coalition of States as an issue of criticalimportance. The war against the international terroristunderground will not be effective until the internationalcommunity makes substantial progress in its struggleagainst drug cartels and narco-barons.A future global system of counteracting terroristand narcotics threats cannot be created without supportfrom regional and subregional structures andinstitutions that have been active in this and other areasof international cooperation.An increase in the number of regionalorganizations and the strengthening of theirmechanisms not only reflects an objective need forfilling the lacunae in the interaction of neighbouringStates  but also meets the urgent need to establishadditional channels for conducting a dialogue andexchange of views on the most important issues. Thelarge-scale operations to liberate the Afghan peoplefrom the repressive Taliban regime and measures aimedat the restoration of peace and stability in war-ravagedAfghanistan have demonstrated what can beaccomplished when the United Nations and regionalorganizations combine their efforts.Today  our friendly neighbour  Afghanistan continues to go through a complicated process ofachieving national accord and establishing stableinstitutions of government and a stable politicalregime. The revival of an independent and peacefulAfghanistan is taking place under difficult conditions.The urgent problem of providing security still exists.The humanitarian situation also remains alarming.However  what has been accomplished by theGovernment of Hamid Karzai is very impressive.It is important that the United Nations continue tocoordinate the international community's commonefforts in strengthening the process of restoring andrehabilitating post-war Afghanistan and completing theelimination of hotbeds of international terrorism on itsterritory and the eradication of religious extremism andthe narcotics threat. In this context  the United NationsAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) facesserious challenges. We believe it is necessary tocontinue increasing economic and humanitarianassistance to Afghanistan and not stop at what has beenaccomplished so far.The Government of Tajikistan will continue tocontribute to the revival of Afghanistan throughbuilding its relations with the friendly Afghan peopleon the basis of friendship  mutual respect andmultifaceted cooperation for the benefit of our twocountries and regional security.With respect to reform of the United Nations  andregional issues  it is important to realize that neitherglobal challenges nor most of the urgent regional issuescan be dealt with successfully unless the whole UnitedNations system is strengthened and its core role ininternational affairs is reinforced. To achieve this inpractice  one has to support the Secretary-General inhis efforts to reform the United Nations internal systemand to recruit personnel with high professional skills.The Member States should assist the Secretary-Generalin his efforts to expand the capacity of the Secretariatto carry out peacekeeping operations  prevent andresolve conflicts and contribute to post-conflict peace-building. Reform also implies further efforts towardsdemocratization of the United Nations system as awhole  so that the capacities and contributions of smallcountries  no matter how numerous their problems  canbe united with those of large States.We are firmly convinced that reforms shouldfocus on improving the efficiency of special UnitedNations institutions and on the implementation ofdevelopment projects. We deem it important that theUnited Nations reconsider the allocation of itsresources  that it stop implementing programmes andprojects of low effectiveness  and instead commit thefreed funds to new priorities.The year that has passed since the fifty-sixthAssembly session has convincingly demonstrated thatthe United Nations  with its 190 Member States  isirreplaceable when dealing with international affairs.As never before  the United Nations has proven itsability to meet the most complicated challenges facedby humanity. It is our conviction that  in the twenty-first century  by cooperating with the United Nations we will be able to create a world without destructivewars  a world that will become secure and prosperous."
"167",6845,"TKM",57,2002,"﻿Let me first of all convey greetings and wishes ofpeace and prosperity to the people of your countriesfrom the President of Turkmenistan  SaparmuratNiyazov.Allow me to congratulate the President on theoccasion of his election to such a high and responsiblepost and wish him success in the organization of thefruitful work of the fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly.I would also like to welcome the SwissConfederation and Timor-Leste on their membershipthis year in the United Nations.From the first days of its independentdevelopment  neutral Turkmenistan has cooperatedclosely with the United Nations and considers thatcooperation the main direction for its foreign policy.The key issue for Turkmenistan as a neutralcountry in such conditions is cooperation  in the nameof peace and security and the well-being and prosperityof its people. We constantly feel that we have thesupport of the United Nations for our foreign policyinitiatives aimed at strengthening these goals. Ourcommitment to these international obligations as apermanently neutral State remains unchanged.The importance of promoting the role of theUnited Nations is constantly becoming more obviousagainst the background of current developments ofboth global and regional processes where theconcentration of collective efforts and the adoption ofdecisions that take into account various interests arerequired. Turkmenistan stands for strengthening andbroadening the role of the United Nations in thesolution not only of global problems  but also in thecollective discussion of regional issues and for a moreextensive use of the potential of the United Nations andits institutions in proposing and implementing foreignpolicy initiatives.We see huge opportunities in the closecooperation of the United Nations and its specializedbodies in the implementation of the large-scale nationalprojects. In this context we express our gratitude forthe cooperation of the leadership of the United Nationsand its specialized agencies  such as the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP)  the United NationsChildren's Fund (UNICEF)  the United NationsPopulation Fund (UNFPA)  the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) the United Nations International Drug ControlProgramme (UNDCCP) and others. In cooperation withthese agencies  the Government of Turkmenistan iscarrying out a number of large projects of social andeconomic orientation that are producing specific resultsin the areas of health care  social affairs  education environment and other areas.More than a year has passed since the tragicevents of 11 September 2001  which forced us toevaluate the issues of security of our people and ourStates through a qualitatively new scale ofmeasurement and has confirmed the necessity toconsolidate efforts in this direction.In this context the region of Central Asia hascome to the forefront of the world's attention. In many30respects the prospects for peace and security willdepend on the way multilateral dialogue develops onthese issues in the region.Turkmenistan attaches foremost importance to therole of the United Nations in invigorating regional andinterregional dialogue in the search for solutions toemerging problems. In this connection I would like todraw your attention to the initiative of the President ofTurkmenistan in creating a regional consultativecouncil of the heads of Government of the countries ofCentral Asia. This would be a high-level interstatebody for regular consultations and the development ofjoint decisions on matters that touch directly upon thedestinies of the States in the region and the real needsof their people.Primarily  these issues would include trade andeconomic interaction  energy supply  cross-bordertrade  water use  transportation and humanitariancooperation. We believe that multilateral consultationson the part of heads of State will contribute to thedevelopment and implementation of agreed actions bythe parties  on the basis of mutual interests  and willenable the creation of a maximally effective system ofrational interaction.In this regard  the initiative of the President ofTurkmenistan  Mr. Niyazov  to hold an internationalconference in Turkmenistan on economic cooperationin Central and South Asia  with the participation ofrepresentatives from the region  the United States Russia  China  Japan  countries of the European Union other interested States  and international financial andeconomic institutions  can be considered to be verytimely.Such a forum will promote a new system ofeconomic ties between West and East based on jointand equal cooperation of States. Its main goal shouldbe creation of the most favourable conditions for trade investment activities  and the introduction of moderntechnology. Moreover  holding such an internationalconference will make it possible for developedcountries to assess the real potential for industrial andsocial development of States in Central and South Asia.The beginning of work on the trans-Afghan gaspipeline projects using the “Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan” route is of great importance in developingregional cooperation. The agreement for theconstruction of the new gas pipeline was signed in Mayof this year  in Islamabad  by the Presidents ofTurkmenistan  Afghanistan and Pakistan.Turkmenistan welcomes the interest shown in thisproject by large companies  financial and industrialgroups  and first of all by the Asian DevelopmentBank  which is taking an active part in the negotiatingprocess for the implementation of the trans-Afghan gaspipeline project.The trans-Afghan gas pipeline is a project on aninternational scale that has colossal social  economicand political significance  primarily from the point ofview of strengthening stability and security in theregion. The trans-Afghan gas pipeline  of which morethan 700 kilometres would be laid throughAfghanistan  has  in addition to its economiccomponent  an invaluable social and humanitariansignificance. The construction of the gas pipelinewould create jobs for more than 12 thousand Afghansand would also offer a new social infrastructure forAfghanistan.In this connection we call on the United Nationsto assist us in the effective implementation of thisproject. Turkmenistan had suggested earlier  from thesame rostrum  the development and adoption  under theUnited Nations auspices  of an international conventionon operating regimes and guarantees for interstatepipelines. Such an instrument would  in our view  allowus to create a reliable political and legal mechanism forproviding the safe transportation of critical rawmaterials to world markets.Turkmenistan's foreign policy of positiveneutrality is aimed at ensuring secure development andcooperation aimed at social revival in the countries ofthe region. This entails the creation of new workplacesand fighting against poverty  in other words  everythingthat today embraces the human dimension.Turkmenistan supports the conclusions reached atthe recent Johannesburg World Summit on SustainableDevelopment. We feel that solutions to current worldproblems  especially in the humanitarian  social andenvironmental areas  will require a new approach to thehuman dimension in world politics.In the 21st century  the notion of sustainabledevelopment has acquired a qualitatively new meaningbased on steady and stable economic growth. On of theimportant aspects of sustainable development ismaintaining a balance between  on one hand  industrial31and technological progress and  on the other  protectionof the environment. The realization of this necessity isespecially relevant today  when this balance isbreached throughout the world.The international community is striving toprevent negative  technology-generated consequenceson the environment. A vivid example of that is theKyoto Protocol to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change. Turkmenistan  havingacceded to that important international instrument  istaking an active role in implementing its norms andprinciples  and is cooperating with internationalorganizations.In the 21st century  the problem connected withthe huge deposits of hydrocarbon resources in the basinof the Caspian Sea  which involves not only thecountries of the region but also many other countriesand multinationals  has come to the attention of theworld. It is now known that the deposits of oil and gasin the Caspian Sea are the most important energyresources of the 21st century. Their efficientdevelopment  along with the creation of the necessarypipeline infrastructure for bringing energy resources tothe world markets  will ensure significant economicgrowth for many States and ensure the well-being oftheir people. It is obvious that many countries areinterested in the security of the energy resourcestransit. The United Nations should play an importantrole in this process.The first summit meeting of the Caspian littoralStates in Ashgabat in April of this year  on theinitiative of the President of Turkmenistan  could beconsidered as a qualitatively new stage in this processof agreeing on and developing a mutually acceptablesolution to the Caspian problem. At this historicsummit  Presidents expressed the will of their State andpeople  which is to ensure that the Caspian Sea be andremain a sea of friendship and peace. The result of thesummit is that the Caspian theme was openly discussedfor the first time at such a high level. Strong agreementwas reached that problems are to be resolvedpeacefully and constructively. Thus  the first steptowards a common goal — the determination of thestatus of the Caspian Sea — was made.It is obvious today that effective cooperation andactivities relating to the Caspian Sea as a whole aredirectly connected with ensuring stability in theCaspian region. Turkmenistan hopes that the Caspianregion will achieve peace  stability and durablecooperation on the basis of justice and mutual respect.We need collective efforts in order to solve theproblems of the international community. The solutionof these problems is possible  not through collectiveefforts alone  but also through the assumption by eachmember of the international community of itsindividual role and responsibilities. This is the logicguiding the political behaviour of Turkmenistan in itspursuit of the goals of strengthening peace andeconomic  social and cultural development. Ourcountry is always ready for constructive partnership.The United Nations can rest assured in that respect."
"168",6873,"TON",57,2002,"﻿As Ioffer you my congratulations upon your assumption ofyour high office  Mr. President  I must also praise your6predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo  for atruly exemplary term as President  which was markedat the outset by the Nobel Peace Prize for theOrganization and which closed with the promise of therecently concluded World Summit on SustainableDevelopment. Together with the continuing leadershipof Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the support of theOrganization's Member States  I look forward to thattradition of excellence and achievement continuingunder your presidency  Sir.I add my voice to the chorus within thisAssembly warmly welcoming the Swiss Confederationto our fold and congratulating East Timor on itsforthcoming accession to membership. Tonga verymuch looks forward to working with both of them asfully-fledged States Members of the Organization.While 11 September 2001 will for all of us beever present  it is fitting that we pause to rememberthose who fell in the line of duty and those other lovedones who perished on that terrible day. Those horrificevents should serve to inspire us to rededicateourselves and galvanize our collective efforts to fightthe scourge of terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations.My Government continues to formulate measuresin compliance with Security Council resolution 1373(2001). These measures have both national andregional dimensions  and a number of workshops havebeen held in the Pacific region during the year toensure that Pacific island countries formulate viablecounter-terrorism measures and to assist them to do so.A number of key Government agencies  including civilaviation  immigration  police  finance and customsagencies  have already adopted measures  includingfinancial and rapid reaction security measures  totighten the security aspect of the resolution. Obviously the sustained assistance of developed countries in ourregion has been very useful in our endeavours. It is ourearnest hope that our required country report will bebefore the Counter-Terrorism Committee by the year'send. In this respect  I am grateful to the Committee andto the Security Council for their patience.Since I last addressed this Assembly  at theMillennium Summit  there have been further signpoststo add to the developmental path. These are signpostsso readily identifiable as Doha  Monterrey and  now Johannesburg. These names epitomize the vision andthe as yet unfulfilled promise of our collectivedevelopment aspirations in this era of globalization. Inthat regard  I commend President Fox and the people ofMexico for their sterling efforts earlier this year. It waspleasing that consensus prevailed on critical thematicissues of particular import to developing countries  andwe look forward to the opportunities that Monterreywill afford. I further commend President Mbeki and thepeople of South Africa for their wonderful achievementearlier this month. I am particularly pleased that theJohannesburg Summit gave prominence and profile inthe Plan of Implementation to the sustainabledevelopment of small island developing States. In thatregard  Tonga looks forward to the 10-year review ofthe Barbados Programme of Action in 2004 as a furthersignpost in the developmental path that will giveimpetus to what was achieved in Johannesburg. Inpreparing for that review  Tonga will continue itsnational efforts to refine and identify areas for specificpriority capacity-building needs  as well asopportunities to take increased advantage of financialand technological support.As a developing ocean State  we are encouragedby the particular commitments in the JohannesburgPlan of Implementation on fish stocks and fishingpractices. The implementation of those time-boundcommitments requires responsibility and good faithfrom all parties so as to ensure that States like mineobtain their fair share of their vastest and mostbountiful resource. We are pleased that the UnitedNations fish stocks Agreement has entered into forceand welcome the informal meeting of States partiesthat took place here in New York recently. In thisrespect  we urge other Member States to become partyto that important Agreement. Within this context  wealso continue to welcome the preparations under wayfor giving effect to the Convention on the Conservationand Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks inthe Western and Central Pacific Ocean. TheConvention is a testament to our commitment toconserving and sustainably managing a criticallyimportant resource. As such  we continue to urge thedistant water fishing nations with a real fisheriesinterest in our region to make every effort to become aparty to the Convention. Tonga continues to value thework and decisions taken this year of the Meeting ofStates Parties to the United Convention on the Law ofthe Sea  the International Seabed Authority and thethird meeting of the United Nations Open-endedInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Lawof the Sea. We look forward to an important milestone7later this year: the twentieth anniversary of the UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I hope thatMember States will consider the upcoming anniversaryas an opportune time to become a party to theConvention.Our region has further endorsed a first-everregional oceans policy that elaborates some guidingprinciples that should serve as a template for countrieslike Tonga to consider using to developing nationalocean policies that strengthen coordination andcomplementarity in our ocean-related activities. Oneactivity that continues to give rise to deep concern isthe transshipment of radioactive material through thewaters of our region. In this regard  while we mightunderstand the needs and requirements of those Statesthat engage in this activity  it is just as important thatthe necessary framework for prior notice  consent safety and compensation for countries like Tonga notbe ignored.Tonga continues to support the development of anappropriate environmental vulnerability index for smallisland developing States and commends the continuingwork of the South Pacific Applied GeoscienceCommission in that regard. It is our belief that  withthe participation of States  such an index has thepotential to provide accurate indicators of vulnerabilityto which small islands in particular are exposed  suchas natural disasters  climate change and sea level rise.As such  Tonga welcomes the commitment by certainAnnex I countries under the Kyoto Protocol madeduring the Johannesburg Summit to ratify the Protocoland the further opportunities for progress that suchpositive action presents.On 30 and 31 December 2001  tropical cycloneWaka traversed the northern group of Tonga with awind velocity in excess of 100 miles an hour andresulted in substantial and horrific damage to thoseislands. To be sure  the damage was estimated at over140 million Tongan dollars  but thankfully there was noloss of life. The inevitable and difficult task of relief recovery and reconstruction was compounded by thegeographic distance from the capital of the northerngroup and the sheer scale of the damage sustained.Luckily  action by traditional donor Governments andour neighbours within the region  territorialgovernments  regional and international organizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum and specific UnitedNations agencies  was swift and generous and providedmuch-needed assistance to my Government. I amdeeply grateful to those Governments  organizationsand agencies  as well as to non-governmentalorganizations and churches  for their valued assistancein our time of crisis. Two weeks after the cyclone nature  having wrought such devastating winds  causedmore favourable weather to prevail  which greatlyhelped the replanting phases of recovery. We expect aresurgence of the critical agricultural  tourism andfisheries sectors by the end of the year.While information and communicationstechnology (ICT) remains the way to go  we continuewith our own efforts to bridge the digital divide andtake maximum advantage of the digital revolution. Todo so will require joint efforts in tandem with theinternational community and the United Nations particularly through the efforts of the United NationsICT Task Force as one avenue. Such efforts must becharacterized by partnership and inclusion in the ICTprocess  so that all developing States in every regioncan benefit. The United Nations role of bridging coordinating and integrating activities is thereforecrucial. In that respect  we urge continued support forthe Small Island Developing States InformationNetwork (SIDSNet) and for efforts to strengthen itscapacity to support and assist small island developingStates.We welcome the fruitful outcome earlier this yearof the General Assembly special session on children.While we recognize the promise it holds for the welfareand well-being of all children  like the outcome of therecent special session on HIV/AIDS  commitmentsmust progress beyond rhetoric into concrete action.Tonga fully supports the work of the SecurityCouncil and  like other speakers before me  calls forthe full implementation of all of its resolutions toensure an enduring peace in arenas of conflict and tolift the veil of doubt where such doubt could lead toconflict.In one such arena  we join the call for an end toviolence  a return to the negotiating table and thebuilding of confidence so as to realize the coexistenceof two States  side by side in secure and recognizedborders.Tonga also supports efforts to streamline the workof the General Assembly so that it can play the pivotaland focused role we desire. In like terms  we supportthe call for reform of the Security Council  in whichthe number of both permanent and non-permanent seats8would be increased to accord with and respond totoday's realities.Finally  with respect to pertinent regional issues Tonga endorses the views expressed in both the NadiDeclaration  contained in document A/56/1015  and theSuva Communiqué  that will be contained in documentA/57/331. They are the respective outcomes of thethird Summit of the African  Caribbean and PacificHeads of State and Government  held in Nadi  Fiji  inJuly 2002  and of the annual meeting of the PacificIslands Forum Leaders held in Suva  Fiji  in August2002."
"169",6913,"TTO",57,2002,"﻿Please allowme to preface my indication by indicating to thisAssembly the regret of my Head of Government and ofmy Foreign Minister  who could not join us on thisoccasion due to pressing domestic electoralcommitments.I would wish  on behalf of the Government andpeople of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  toextend to Mr. Kavan our most sincere congratulationson his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. We are convincedthat  under his enlightened guidance  we will addresswith determination and courage the issues that confrontthe international community.We would also wish to express at this time ourdeep appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  President of the Assembly at its fifty-sixth session for the courageous leadership which he displayed inbringing that session to a successful conclusion underdifficult and trying circumstances.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  wewish to place on record our appreciation for hisrelentless commitment to the cause of peace  securityand development and for his tireless efforts inachieving the goals of this world body.The delegation of Trinidad and Tobago extends awarm welcome to Switzerland on its becoming the190th State Member of the United Nations and looksforward in the not-too-distant future to the admissionof Timor-Leste into our United Nations family.The maintenance of international peace andsecurity  together with the promotion of economicprogress and the achievement of social justice forpeoples all over the globe  are the pillars on which thisOrganization was founded more than half a centuryago. These goals remain as valid today  and even moreso  as when our founding fathers created thisOrganization.As Governments  therefore  and as MemberStates of the United Nations  it is incumbent upon us the international community as a whole  to reaffirmconstantly  by word and deed  our faith in andcommitment to the fundamental purposes andprinciples of the United Nations  particularly in thearea of international peace and security. In this field the Security Council  charged as it is with primaryresponsibility under the Charter for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security  must be allowed tofully play its fundamental role  as it did in confrontingthe challenge posed to the international community bythe terrorist acts committed in this very city on 11September 2001.Trinidad and Tobago remains committed toworking with the Counter-Terrorism Committeeestablished by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)in order to do our part to eradicate the scourge ofterrorism from our world.On 31 August 1962  some 40 years ago  Trinidadand Tobago became an independent State andimmediately thereafter joined this universal body. Wein Trinidad and Tobago recognize and appreciate therole that the United Nations has played in promotingfundamental human rights and freedoms  theinternational rule of law  the peaceful settlement ofdisputes  the right to self-determination and thesovereign equality of States. Without properobservance by all States  large and small  of these basicprinciples  the world would most certainly have been amore challenging place for us all.It is in that context that Trinidad and Tobagoviews with increasing concern the continued absence ofa just and lasting peace in the Middle East. It is clearthat peace will continue to elude that region unless allparties concerned demonstrate unequivocally the willto collaborate with a view to achieving the vision setout in Security Council resolution 1397 (2002).The maintenance of international peace andsecurity is a sine qua non for the achievement of oureconomic and social development goals. It is againstthis background that Trinidad and Tobago  as a smallState and as a developing country  supports all effortsmade through the international conferences and specialsessions held within the framework of the UnitedNations to address the international social agenda inpursuit of integral human development worldwide.Some of those include the special session on HIV/AIDS  the International Conference on Financing forDevelopment  the Second World Assembly on Ageing the special session on children and the just concludedWorld Summit on Sustainable Development  all ofwhich have not only recognized the concerns of themore vulnerable groups within our societies  but have30also identified various policy alternatives throughwhich those concerns can be addressed.There can  in fact  be no meaningful developmentif significant segments of our populations are allowedto remain in a state of increasing vulnerability. As aresult  Trinidad and Tobago participated fully in thework of the Second World Assembly on Ageing  thespecial session on children and the special session onHIV/AIDS.It is our hope that the adoption of the PoliticalDeclaration and the Madrid International Plan ofAction on Ageing  as well as the Declaration and Planof Action emerging from this year's special session onchildren  will serve as the basis for the development ofpolicies at the national level to deal with the problemsfaced by these two vulnerable groups in our societies.For its part  the Government of Trinidad and Tobagohas recently completed a draft national policy onageing that will address the principal concerns of ourageing population.The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to hamper theeconomic and social development of our Caribbeanregion  affecting as it does the most economicallyactive and productive segments of our societies. MyGovernment has sought to incorporate this issue as amatter of priority into its national strategic planningprocess. It is virtually impossible  however  for any onecountry unilaterally to deal effectively with this publichealth issue. For that reason  Trinidad and Tobago iscommitted to participating fully in all relevant regionaland international initiatives.In that regard  member States of the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) were among the first totranslate the global commitments undertaken at thespecial session on HIV/AIDS into regional targetswhen  in 2001  our Governments adopted the NassauDeclaration on Health  which identified priorities foraction and partnership in addressing this global healthissue. However  assistance is urgently needed to boostthese national and regional initiatives. We considertimely the launching of the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. We hope that throughthis Fund  Governments will be further empowered intheir efforts to implement measures aimed at theeventual eradication of these diseases.As a country which falls within the category ofsmall island developing States  Trinidad and Tobagofeels obliged to make reference to the tendency in theinternational community to underestimate thephenomenon of vulnerability  both as a condition ofsize and stage of development. Small island developingeconomies are by definition vulnerable  and in a globalvillage  where negative occurrences in one sphere canhave a ripple effect in others  the implications for us allare as real as they are apparent. The lack of inherentcapacity  technology and technical know-how limits theadaptive capacity of small island developing States tocope with the challenges that they face  includingglobal environmental problems such as climate change biodiversity and land degradation.As we engage in efforts at the international levelto achieve environmentally sound economicdevelopment  Trinidad and Tobago remains cautious inthe light of the dismal record regarding theimplementation of commitments made at the RioSummit  10 years ago. That Summit concluded with thesigning of two conventions  one on climate change andthe other on biodiversity  together with the adoption ofAgenda 21.It continues to concern us that emissions ofgreenhouse gases have increased worldwide and thatclimate change is occurring at a faster rate thanpreviously estimated  especially since small islanddeveloping States are disproportionately vulnerable tothe impact of climate change  while being responsiblefor a minuscule proportion of such emissions. Trinidadand Tobago therefore urges that decisive action betaken to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol comes intoforce as early as possible  as that is the only existinginternational instrument that addresses these problems.We therefore welcome the political commitment givenby the leaders of some key industrialized countries toratify this Protocol in the near future.It would seem  however  that progress underAgenda 21 has been limited primarily by lack offunding and capacity  which has resulted in thewidening of the gap between the attainment ofsustainable development and the alleviation of poverty.Trinidad and Tobago is therefore pleased that therecently concluded World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  held in Johannesburg  South Africa agreed to specific targets in areas such as water andsanitation  health  biodiversity loss  restoration ofdepleted fish stocks and chemicals.The fact that the Johannesburg Summit achieveda greater synthesis and integration of the three pillars31of sustainable development  namely  the social economic and environmental  is also a welcomedevelopment. The enormous challenges that theseissues collectively pose provide a profound insight intothe magnitude of the task faced by developingcountries in their quest for sustainable development.The real test of whether Johannesburg was a successwill  however  come in the months and years ahead aswe seek to implement the commitments made byMember States.We must build on the momentum of the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development and ensure thatour future course of action guarantees the outcomesenvisaged in the Plan of Implementation and thePolitical Declaration emanating from that Summit. It isin this respect that Trinidad and Tobago wouldtherefore expect that a priority of this Assembly wouldbe a decision to convene an international conference in2004 to review the implementation of the BarbadosPlan of Action for the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States  and more so in view ofthe growing recognition by the internationalcommunity of the special and vulnerable situation ofthese countries.Additionally  the Assembly may wish to note thatsome of these smaller economies continue to be facedby circumstances such as onerous debt-servicingschedules  lack of access to new finance and obstaclesin penetrating non-traditional markets  which negate alltheir efforts aimed at economic advancement.It is for this reason that Trinidad and Tobagolooks forward to the early implementation of theenhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries DebtInitiative and other United Nations initiatives aimed atalleviating the economic burdens faced by many low-and middle-income countries. These countries arebeing asked to service debts and at the same time tofulfil their commitments to the Millenniumdevelopment agenda. In this regard  we welcome therecent appointment by the Secretary-General of a HighRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries Landlocked Developing Countries and Small IslandDeveloping States. Trinidad and Tobago looks forwardto working with the High Representative to ensure theeffective discharge of his mandate  particularly as itrelates to small island developing States.Another noble attempt conceptualized within theUnited Nations framework was the InternationalConference on Financing for Development  held inMonterrey earlier this year. Trinidad and Tobago isheartened by the outcome of that Conference thatdefined the necessary actions for addressing some ofthe more pressing problems faced by developingcountries in the areas of mobilizing domestic andinternational resources for development  internationaltrade  financial and technical cooperation fordevelopment and external debt. My delegationtherefore urges this Assembly to endorse the MonterreyConsensus as adopted by that Conference.At the regional level  Trinidad and Tobago isengaged in joint efforts with its Caribbean Community(CARICOM) partners to assume responsibility for themanagement of our developing economies. At aSpecial CARICOM Summit held last month CARICOM leaders mandated that a regionalstabilization fund should be created within theframework of a long-term economic transformationprogramme. The purpose of the fund will be to provideregional economies with the necessary financialresources to respond to current and long-termeconomic difficulties. This regional financialcooperation programme is intended to augmentbudgetary resources available to member States of theCommunity from both domestic sources andmultilateral institutions.Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to theinternational rule of law and to justice for all. Our rolein the reintroduction into the international agenda ofthe idea of the creation of a permanent InternationalCriminal Court in 1989 is well known. And  since thattime  Trinidad and Tobago has not ceased to promotesupport for that Court  both regionally andinternationally. It continues to be the hope of myGovernment that at the Review Conference of 2009 the crimes of drug-trafficking and terrorism will alsobe included within the jurisdiction of the Court.It is noteworthy that many States regard theRome Statute of the International Criminal Court as thesingle most important international instrument sincethe adoption of the United Nations Charter. Thesuccessful conclusion of the first meeting of theAssembly of States Parties to the Statute last week wasa positive step towards the operational phase of theCourt  which now stands as a permanent warning towould-be perpetrators of the crimes within itsjurisdiction that impunity will no longer be tolerated bythe international community and that justice will be32assured to their victims. In the election of judges tothat Court  Trinidad and Tobago would  as a smallState  consider it an honour to have one of its nationalselected in order to continue its contribution to the causeof international criminal justice.But justice for all victims of the most heinouscrimes of genocide  war crimes and crimes againsthumanity will only be assured when this most recentlycreated International Criminal Tribunal gains thewidest possible acceptance. We therefore encouragethose States that have not yet done so to ratify oraccede to the Statute.In order to ensure that the Court will trulyachieve the goals for which it was established  theStates Parties must stand together in their efforts topreserve the integrity of the Statute to which they havecommitted themselves and must  with one accord resist any attempts to undermine the effectiveness andindependence of the Court.In conclusion  the issues which I have raised inthis forum today point to the need for the globalizationof genuine commitment to the resolution of theproblems that currently confront our internationalcommunity. What is required therefore is a greatersense of shared commitment to the fundamentalpurposes and principles of the United Nations in theface of new and ominous threats to global peace andsecurity; to the vision of a world free from poverty hunger and disease; and to an internationalorganization fully charged by its Member States withthe political will to tackle frontally all the challengesthat pose threats to the very survival of mankind.Trinidad and Tobago  forty years after joining theUnited Nations  renews before the Assembly its firmcommitment to abide fully by the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations Charter and to makeits contribution to the economic and social progress ofpeoples the world over."
"170",6960,"TUN",57,2002,"﻿Allow me at the outset to congratulate the President onhis election to the presidency of this session of theGeneral Assembly and to wish him every success indischarging his functions. Because of the profoundfriendship that exists between Tunisia and the CzechRepublic  we assure him of our cooperation and supportas he conducts the business of this session. I would alsolike to take this opportunity to convey our thanks to hispredecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  who conducted thelast session's work so ably and effectively.It gives me pleasure to express our appreciationand gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who isconstantly playing a constructive and effective role inthe service of the noble goals of our Organization.I would like to extend Tunisia's congratulationsto the Swiss Confederation on its admission tomembership in the United Nations.The various repercussions of the events of 11September last  that we have all vigorouslycondemned  continue to be felt and to remind themembers of the international community thatstrengthening our common action is essential formeeting the security and development challengesconfronting our world today. These challenges must bedealt with through increased discussion  cooperationand solidarity  on the basis of a global  integratedvision of the future. The establishment of a linkbetween security and development  as well as a delicateunderstanding of the dialectic that exists between thesetwo elements  make it possible not only to find aneffective solution to certain international problems butalso to prevent their occurring.The global vision that we advocate as a modusoperandi at the international level is basically built onstrengthened values of understanding and interactionamong religions  civilizations and cultures  onenshrining the principles of solidarity  moderation andtolerance  on poverty eradication  combating exclusionand marginalization; a vision that requires a collectivestand against fanaticism and terrorism.These principles and values are based on thecivilizational plan that His Excellency President ZineEl Abidine Ben Ali has constantly advocated duringthis new era in Tunisian society. This plan wasstrengthened following the essential constitutionalreform  which was unanimously adopted for the peopleof Tunisia during a referendum and during which thepeople opted for a Republic of tomorrow  based on therule of law and institutions  the protection of humanrights and solidarity among members of our society.The successes and achievements gained in ourcountry  thanks to this integrated global approach thatwe have adopted to redress the social  economic political and cultural situation of the Tunisian people have strengthened our conviction that internationalrelations must be based on the same approach for thewell-being of humanity at large and for meeting thechallenges we are facing today.Tunisia has on a number of occasions submittedseveral initiatives  in particular the appeal made in1989 from this rostrum by His Excellency Mr. Zine ElAbidine Ben Ali  President of the Republic  for auniversal covenant of peace and progress  laying downthe foundation of a better future for the internationalcommunity in a spirit of constructive cooperation immune to conflicts and to wastage of resources andenergy.Tunisia believes that it is time to hold aninternational conference to draft common denominatorsthat would provide a basis for a code of conduct to beobserved by all parties. This code would help to initiate22a responsible dialogue that would avoid any doublestandards and would attenuate any feelings ofdeprivation or oppression felt by many peoples. Webelieve that the United Nations would be the idealforum to develop and sponsor this kind of dialogueamong States.One year after the painful events that shook theUnited States  the danger of terrorism is still felt  and itcontinues to pose a threat to international peace andsecurity. We therefore have to demonstrate constantresolve in the face of this phenomenon in our attemptsto eradicate it once and for all. Now that the mostobvious manifestations of terrorism have been dealt with the international community must tackle its causes whichare linked to security  development and culture.Tunisia was one of the first countries to warnabout the dangers of terrorism  well before the eventsof 11 September. At the beginning of the 1990s  we werein favour of coordinated  international efforts to deal with contain and eliminate this scourge. It is disquieting thatcertain terrorists are still present in many countries andenjoy protection under the pretext of granting them theright of political asylum  without any inquiry into theiractions  their activities or the crimes that theycommitted against their countries of origin.Many regions of the world still suffer the horrorsof poverty and destitution. Only through a focused careful approach to achieve the Millennium Goals which were reaffirmed at several subsequentinternational conferences  will it be possible to resolvethis situation. Tunisia had already adopted an initiativealong these lines by proposing the creation of a worldsolidarity fund to combat poverty in the world. Twoyears after this initiative was put forward  and after itsadoption by the General Assembly  and following thedecision taken by the World Summit for SustainableDevelopment that discussed setting up this fund  wehope now that the research and studies conducted inthis framework  particularly the latest report of theUnited Nations Secretary-General on modalities for thefunctioning of and the use of such a fund  will make itpossible for the fund to come into being this year.Poverty eradication is a crucial element inguaranteeing the stability of societies and preventingother scourges  such as wars  terrorism and diseases particularly since this is basic to any global strategythat guarantees international peace and security.Africa continues to suffer from conflicts and fromeconomic and development problems and requiresconstant attention from the international community.Many analyses have proven that the instability of thecontinent is basically due to Africa's economic andsocial problems. Many international meetings andsummits have also confirmed this. The NewPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is aninitiative that might draw the attention of donor Statesand the attention of international financial institutionsto this situation.We believe that if the international communitywants Africa to have a bright future  it cannot continueto disregard its basic needs or subject it to meregeostrategic considerations  or  indeed  tie internationalaid to harsh conditions that many African States cannotfulfil.The international community must now play aprominent role in prevailing upon Israel to halt itsaggression against the Palestinian people  withdrawfrom the occupied territories and abide by internationallaw on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and other relevant resolutions  as wellas on the basis of the principle of “land for peace”.The Palestinian people need the unflaggingsupport of the international community so that it canrecover its legitimate rights  primarily its right to createa State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Israel'spolicy of assassinating Palestinian leaders  ofmaintaining a blockade against the legitimate PresidentYasser Arafat  of starving civilians  and of massacringpeople and expelling them from their land in violationof the Fourth Geneva Convention only worsens thissituation and fans resentment and a desire for revenge.The international community must redouble itsefforts to bring about a return to the negotiating tablein order to give real meaning to the vision of twoStates  Palestine and Israel  living side by side withinsecure recognized borders  as advocated by PresidentBush in his speech made in June 2002  and on the basisof the comprehensive approach advocated by the Arabplan adopted at the recent Arab Summit in Beirut.Tunisia has always worked for peace in theMiddle East. We have taken part in the multilateralnegotiations and today are ready to continue ourconstructive role for the resumption of talks and theestablishment of a just  comprehensive and lastingpeace that will guarantee the liberation of Arab23territories still occupied by Israel since 1967  includingthe Syrian Golan and the remainder of the Lebaneseterritory still under Israeli occupation.Furthermore  lasting peace and stability for all thepeoples of the Middle East requires continuedinternational efforts to make progress on the questionof Iraq through peaceful means and by implementingrelevant Security Council resolutions.We believe that dialogue between the UnitedNations and Iraq remains the best way to resolve alloutstanding Iraqi issues.We welcome  in this regard  Iraq's decision toaccept the return of the weapons inspectors withoutconditions. This is  as was noted by the Secretary-General at the beginning of our session  a step towardsdétente in the region and the lifting of sanctions.Tunisia supports the Arab position that rejectsattacks against any Arab country and any furthersuffering and harm to the brotherly Iraqi people. Ourposition also supports maintaining the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of Iraq  as well as the sovereigntyand territorial integrity of the State of Kuwait  whilestressing the need to avoid any destabilization ofsecurity there.We wish to reaffirm the need to lift  once and forall  the sanctions against sisterly Libya  which hasfulfilled all its commitments and has offered its fullcooperation towards finding a just and satisfactorysolution to the Lockerbie case.The global vision of peace and security in theworld is no less important at the regional level  whichcomplements and supports joint international action.Tunisia considers the Arab Maghreb Union as astrategic choice and we have continuously worked toconsolidate it and to remove obstacles that haveimpeded its progress. We hope that joint Maghrebaction will lead to greater integration among thecountries of the Union.On the regional level  Tunisia is working to deepenits relations of cooperation and partnership in the Euro-Mediterranean region. We welcome the reactivation of the“Five plus Five” forum  which will lead to greateropportunities to promote dialogue  cooperation andsolidarity between the two shores of the Mediterraneanand will strengthen elements of peace  stability  anddevelopment. In this manner  relations may developamong countries of this forum in a spirit of mutualrespect  while preserving the interest of all parties.Tunisia will work on this basis and do everythingit can to guarantee the success of the “Five plus Five”summit  which we will be hosting in 2003.The considerable technological advanceswitnessed today definitely have an impact oninternational economic recovery. Mindful of theimportance of this issue  Tunisia was one of the firstcountries to call for the holding of a summit oninformation technology  an idea that was unanimouslysupported by all international parties. Tunisia will havethe honour of hosting the World Summit on theInformation Society in 2005. We hope that the GeneralAssembly will continue to help prepare thegroundwork in order to make it a success.In this context  we would like to stress the need tofacilitate the transfer of clean technology to developingcountries and to promote means of cooperation amongNorth-South and South-South countries  as well as tostrengthen financial cooperation in order to provideadditional funding to projects relating to environmentalprotection in the developing countries.The subjects discussed in Johannesburg and thematters discussed at the International Conference onFinancing for Development in Monterrey  as well asthe subjects dealt with in the WTO conference in Dohashould complement one another. In the interest of allcountries  particularly the developing countries globalization must be made a factor for progress foreveryone as well as a factor for strengthening peaceand security.Today's world promises new hopes and ambitionsbut also contains threats and challenges  theimplications of which should be understood. Tunisia'smessage to this Assembly is that we should worktogether to draw up an act of international partnershipin all fields based on an international code of conductfor all parties  in the political  economic  development security and stability fields.The principles that unite us in promoting themajor priorities and preventing new dangers tointernational peace and security should impel us toadopt a preventive approach based  first  on respect forthe principle of international law as the basis forpeaceful coexistence; secondly  on providing equalopportunities for all developing countries without any24exclusion or marginalization and thirdly  on resolvinginternational problems  conflicts  crises or wars on thebasis of established principles of justice and in keepingwith international law."
"171",7007,"TUR",57,2002,"﻿At the outset  I wish to joinother speakers in warmly congratulating you  Sir  onyour election as President of the General Assembly atits fifty-seventh session. My delegation offers you itsfull support to the presidency's work. I also wish to pay26tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for hisable guidance of the last session.It gives me great pleasure to salute hereSecretary-General Kofi Annan and the two newMembers of the United Nations  the SwissConfederation and the Democratic Republic of EastTimor.Turkey is firmly convinced that  throughout thisnew century  the need for the United Nations willincreasingly grow. It is the only multilateralOrganization with universal membership dedicated tothe noble aims of maintaining peace and internationalsecurity  addressing global issues and establishingstandards that should apply to all.Exactly a year ago  evil in its worst form struckNew York and Washington  D.C. Since the tragedy of11 September  it has become amply clear that terroristorganizations have much broader internationalnetworks than anticipated. Terrorism has many namesand faces and recognizes no boundaries. This is aphenomenon that is not confined to and cannot beidentified with any particular geography  religion  raceor culture. Terrorism is the most blatant violation ofhuman rights. Nothing can ever justify terrorism andthere can be no leniency towards it.Turkey has been calling for years for intensifiedinternational cooperation against terrorism. We havebeen actively engaged in the work of the UnitedNations to fight this scourge and we commend theongoing efforts. Security Council resolution 1373(2001)  in particular  provides a clear road map withregard to the steps that need to be taken to combatterrorism more effectively.It is incumbent upon all Member States to adoptexisting international legislation and to review theirrelevant national laws accordingly. We urge thoseStates that have not yet done so to become parties tothe 12 international conventions on specific terroristoffences. We also look forward to the completion of thework on a comprehensive convention againstinternational terrorism.Preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping havegained even more priority in this era of new conflicts.Turkey has been actively participating in the efforts ofthe United Nations in conflict prevention and plays asignificant role within peace missions mandated by theUnited Nations  the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationand the Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope (OSCE). Hence  we commend the efforts of theSecretary-General to ensure prompt reaction toemerging crises and welcome the manifoldconsiderations contained in his report (A/55/985) onthe prevention of armed conflicts.My country took over the command of theInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) inKabul at an extremely critical juncture. We take pridein fulfilling that task and thank the other contributingnations. Indeed  all ISAF personnel are serving with astrong sense of purpose and mission. Traditionally aclose friend of the Afghans  Turkey has contributed formany years to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan. Wesalute the performance of the Transitional Authorityunder the leadership of His Excellency Mr. HamidKarzai  the Afghan President.Today we must rapidly embark upon real andtangible development efforts in Afghanistan. It is withthis understanding that Turkey provides the Afghanpeople with assistance that is directed at developingtheir national potential. Likewise  efforts to build theAfghan national army and the police force as well assolidarity and unity among the ethnic groups are ofcrucial importance.We feel strongly that the international communityshould fulfil its commitments adopted at the TokyoInternational Conference on Reconstruction Assistanceto Afghanistan. support His Excellency Mr. LakhdarBrahimi  the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan  in his efforts to secure greaterfinancial assistance. The United Nations is to becommended for successfully spearheadingreconstruction activity.Turkey is located in close proximity to many ofthe existing conflict spots and potential new threatsthat are high on the United Nations agenda.Accordingly  we are closely interested in promotingpeace  stability and prosperity in our part of the world particularly in the Balkans  the Middle East and theCaucasus.We have been witnessing positive changes in thepolitical and security environment of the Balkans. Themulti-ethnic  multi-religious and multicultural fabric ofthe Balkan countries must be preserved. We believenow is the right time for the word Balkans' to befreed from its negative connotation and be made to27stand for such positive concepts as ethnic harmony mutual respect and peaceful cohabitation.We hope that the elections in the Republic ofMacedonia  Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina  andthose to be held in a few weeks' time in Kosovo  willbe instrumental in shaping a better future for theBalkans.Our resolve to further improve our relations withGreece through the current process of constructivedialogue remains intact. We seek to encourage andfoster the spirit of friendship and cooperation so thatwe can make further progress. In that respect  the twocountries signed a number of bilateral documents. Asfor the Aegean Sea  we believe that Turkish-Greekrelations have indeed reached a level of maturity thatcould enable us to address the issues at hand on abilateral basis. To that end  we have been discussingcertain confidence-building measures and have agreedon some. We are also encouraged by the ongoingexploratory contacts.Regarding Cyprus  we continue to support theefforts aimed at finding a just  viable  lasting andcomplete settlement. Cyprus is an issue between thetwo equal  distinct peoples on the island  namely theTurkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots  each ofwhich lives under its own political and democraticstructures. The two peoples of Cyprus should be able tocoexist and share power under a new partnership Statestructure on the basis of the equal status and sovereignequality of the two partner States. We will continue tosupport the current direct talks between the two leadersin Cyprus  which enable the two parties to search forcomprehensive reconciliation without any third-partyinvolvement. We believe that equal treatment of bothsides will foster an environment that will encouragethem to move towards a new partnership of equals excluding the possibility of reverting to the situationthat existed before 1974. We support the recent TurkishCypriot proposals  which provide a sound and realisticbasis for a settlement. We believe that the internationalcommunity should give due consideration to theseproposals  which open a new window of opportunityfor the resolution of this longstanding issue.The decision of the European Union Council tostart accession negotiations with the Greek Cypriotadministration  despite the illegitimacy of its claim torepresent the whole island  has made an agreedsettlement even more elusive. Unfortunately  the GreekCypriot focus so far has been totally diverted toEuropean Union membership. Membership prior tosettlement would create many problems and would leadto tensions on the island and in the easternMediterranean in general. We have reiterated that aunilateral Greek Cypriot entry into the European Unionwould harm the chances for a mutually agreedsettlement establishing a new partnership between thetwo parties. The European Union must tell the GreekCypriots that they will not be admitted before a finalsettlement. That is essential if we are to makemeaningful progress towards resolving the Cyprusissue.In the aftermath of 11 September  peace andstability in the Middle East have gained even moreimportance and urgency. Yet the present outlook of theongoing conflict does not leave much room foroptimism. Violence persists  taking a huge toll on bothsides. This year has been marked by successiveterrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and thedisproportionate use of force by Israel against thePalestinians. The occupation of Palestinian towns andthe destruction of Palestinian infrastructure have onlyexacerbated the already difficult living conditions ofthe Palestinian people.The parameters of peace in the Middle East areembedded in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)and 338 (1973). Those resolutions have now beengiven fuller meaning with the adoption of Councilresolution 1397 (2001)  laying out the vision of twoStates living side by side within secure boundaries.The international community is also encouragedby the Arab League plan adopted at its Beirut Summit based on a vision of the coexistence of all States in theregion through the full implementation of the relevantSecurity Council resolutions. Likewise  the 24 Junestatement of the United States President charts thecontours of a process that will lead to the two-Stateobjective.The international community should engage itselfin encouraging and persuading all parties to the MiddleEast conflict on the road to lasting peace. Theinitiatives of the quartet' are welcome  and Turkey  asa regional facilitator  is ready to offer its assistance inwhatever way may be necessary. We need a28relaunching of the peace process  and Turkey standsready to host a meeting to that end.More than a decade after the liberation of Kuwait the Iraqi problem remains unresolved. Therepercussions of the Gulf war still prevail. The adverseeffects of that situation on the people of Iraq  onTurkey and on the region as a whole are increasing.The only way out for Iraq is to cooperate fully with theUnited Nations by implementing the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions. Turkey has been encouraging Iraqin that direction. We would like to see an Iraq whoseterritorial integrity and political unity are preservedand which is peacefully reintegrated into theinternational community.The Caucasus is another area of close interest forTurkey. We aim to help in establishing comprehensivecooperation in the region. However  the unresolvedconflicts in Nagorny-Karabakh and Abkhazia still standas principal obstacles to political stability andeconomic development. The Security Council hasadopted four resolutions urging the immediatewithdrawal of all troops from the Azerbaijaniterritories  with which Armenia has not complied.Being an active member of the Minsk Group Turkey is working for a peaceful resolution of theNagorny-Karabakh conflict within the framework ofthe OSCE. We initiated a tripartite meeting among theMinisters for Foreign Affairs of Armenia  Azerbaijanand Turkey in May.The Abkhazian conflict still endangers peace andstability in Georgia and in the entire region. From theoutset  Turkey has supported the peaceful resolution ofthe conflict within the framework of the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of Georgia.In addition to the challenges of building nationalstructures and of achieving economic growth  theyoung States of Central Asia have faced a set of newthreats: radical religious movements  terroristactivities  drugs and weapons trafficking. After thetragedy of 11 September  the international communityfinally acknowledged the importance of stability in theregion and of the need to support reform efforts.Transition to full democracy in Central Asia should beseen as a process to be completed gradually as nation-building  political stability and economic conditionsare enhanced.The United Nations is the vehicle for therealization of global expectations. We know that itsfuture rests to a great extent on its responsiveness tothe crisis of development in societies which have fallenbehind.As things stand  the process of globalization  thedominant force of our time  has amply shown itsinherent weaknesses  which are apt to create profoundissues of imbalance and inequality. A case can be madein favour of globalization's ability to raise the level ofprosperity  to reduce poverty and to enhance liberties.However  the fears of the masses cannot be completelyallayed without evidence of more responsivemanagement of that process. Conflict  poverty discrimination and injustice still blight the lives ofmillions in every part of the globe. More than 80countries now have per capita incomes lower thanthose of a decade or more ago. Poverty is an offence tothe conscience of the modern world.In view of all those considerations  Africa has aspecial and urgent claim to global engagement andconcern. My country supports efforts aimed atalleviating problems that afflict that continent. At thisgathering  I wish to salute the birth of the AfricanUnion. We hope that Africans will thus be able to workmore effectively to attain their goals.In the same vein  Turkey has attributed greatimportance to the achievement of the goals andprinciples adopted initially at the 1992 Rio Conferenceon Environment and Development and compiled underAgenda 21. They have been our guidelines incombating poverty and in protecting the globalenvironment throughout the last decade  which hasbrought us to the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  recently held in Johannesburg.Before I conclude  I wish to underline one veryimportant aspect of our foreign policy. Fifty years afterthe cornerstone was laid  the integration of Europe isgaining further momentum. The dynamic of EuropeanUnion enlargement is opening up new horizons. Therecognition of Turkey as a candidate for accession tothe European Union has ushered in a new era inrelations between Turkey and the European Union.Turkey is determined to be part of the historic processof unifying Europe.The past decade has presented us with manythreats to security. Each has created its own challenge.But one fundamental lesson can be drawn from them29all: no single State or organization is able to meet thosemodern challenges on its own. We need to worktogether closely. The United Nations is the very forumin which we can achieve international cooperation andharmonization to meet those challenges. As always Turkey stands ready to do its utmost to contribute tothe realization of its noble goals."
"172",7023,"TUV",57,2002,"﻿Proud as we arethat our small island nation of Tuvalu is a member ofthis great family of nations  first we must give thanksto God Almighty for his love and for allowing us all toparticipate in this general debate. Let me also extendmy delegation's sincere appreciation to theGovernment of our host country  the United States ofAmerica  for its warm hospitality and support.Tuvalu warmly congratulates you  Sir  on yourelection to the high office and commends highly theoutgoing President for his leadership  especially duringa very challenging year for the Organization. Tuvalualso wishes to reaffirm its strong confidence in theSecretary-General. In addition  we warmly congratulateSwitzerland on its entry into the United Nations  andwe welcome membership of East Timor later on in thissession.Tuvalu sincerely joins  both in spirit and hearts in the remembrance of the great loss  particularly ofinnocent human lives  following the terrorist attacks onAmerican soil last year. We pray for the victims'families and for full recovery in restoring their lives.Within our own Organization  we are proud that of thisturmoil the United Nations has come out ever strongerwith the resolve to combat international terrorism.In Tuvalu and many island countries in thePacific  we know our own unique vulnerability is alsofertile ground to forces of terror that threaten thesecurity and survival of the islands. It is in this regardthat Tuvalu is committed to the Pacific Islands ForumDeclarations on regional security  highlighted in theForum Communiqué  which is circulated as a UnitedNations paper. In the same spirit  last year Tuvalupledged its commitment to the United Nations anti-terrorism resolutions  and we still do. But we also needboth technical and financial assistance from theinternational community to enable us to fulfil ourinternational obligations.Joining and being part of the United Nations isnever easy  particularly for a small and poorlyresourced island country such as Tuvalu. Asserting ourplace here competes with the many other priorities ofnation-building. However  our presence here is proof ofour belief all along since our independence that through the United Nations principle of equalparticipation  our voice on our security anddevelopment concerns will be advocated and betterheard.2Although new  Tuvalu supports the reforms beingundertaken in the Organization to streamline andensure efficiency. In particular  it supports initiativesthat have been developed on reforms in the SecurityCouncil and in the work of the Secretariat  and it is ourstrong view that they warrant proper support. It is alsoour view that equitable representation more reflectiveof the diversity in the United Nations membership both in the staffing of United Nations Secretariat and inits various working committees  needs to be properlyconsidered.As a peace-loving nation  Tuvalu believes that theparamount mission of the United Nations must remainthe maintenance of peace and security for all nations ofthe world  as clearly articulated in the preamble to theUnited Nations Charter. However  a long outstandingissue that also warrants serious consideration is thequestion of the Republic of China on Taiwan. Thiscountry has a population of 23 million people  a well-defined territory and an established democratic systemof Government  and is a responsible international actorin world trade and relations. It is  therefore  our strongopinion that the right to self-determination of thepeople of the Republic of China and to join the UnitedNations should be urgently addressed. The UnitedNations cannot be said to be universal  nor can globalpeace be assured  until the Republic of China issue isproperly resolved.As we progress in the new century  however  weare increasingly challenged by the many changes thatare taking place. Never before has the human racefaced such complex challenges. We are in a worldwhere the concept of globalization is in the mediaevery day. Yet while we share a world where trade communications and travel appear to have made us asingle global community  large parts of the worldcontinue to suffer from poverty  marginalization andenvironmental decline. We are far from being acohesive global community. Unfortunately  Tuvalu andmany small island developing States are in aparticularly weak position to participate fully and takeadvantage of the opportunities of globalization. Thereis a genuine need for special assistance to enhance ourcapacity in this regard.On the issue of conflict prevention  Tuvalu  likeother vulnerable small island nations  is particularlyweary of conflicts and wars. It is our humble view that all too often  countries seem compelled to resort tomilitary and violent action in order to resolve conflictsrather than seek to understand the root causes of theseconflicts. We strongly feel this approach needs carefulreconsideration. The build-up of arms and massiveexpenditure on so-called defence completelyovershadow all efforts to resolve the underlying causesof poverty  unrest and instability. For us to survive asan international community we must reverse this trend.We must also learn to listen to each other.In this respect  Tuvalu firmly believes that wemust place greater faith in the United Nations as theforum for meaningfully addressing poverty  conflictsand instability and the effects of environmentaldegradation. It is here  in the common house of thehuman family  where countries should come  put downtheir arms  listen to each other and resolve theirdifferences together. We believe that this is the onlyway forward to ensuring long-lasting world peace security and sustainable development.Tuvalu agrees with the importance of sustainabledevelopment and subscribes to the goals espoused inthe Millennium Declaration  particularly those onpoverty eradication. It also welcomes the holding ofthe United Nations international conferences including  those on the rights of the child  financing fordevelopment and the review of the implementation ofAgenda 21 through the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment. In addition  Tuvalu also appreciatescommitments made recently to replenish the GlobalEnvironment Facility (GEF)  so vitally important tomany countries  especially to Small Island DevelopingStates.However  while Tuvalu appreciates theconsiderations for small island developing States in thevarious processes  we appeal for more concreterecognition  particularly by the donor community  ofour special case so that we can cope with thechallenges that we face  particularly with regards tocapacity-building through quality education and health access to fresh water and affordable energy infrastructures and sanitation. Without additional andadequate resources  partnership initiatives arising fromthose processes will have no real meaning  especiallyfor those groups that are most in need  such as women children and people in rural and outer island areas.It need not be repeated  but for Tuvalu development aid is indispensable to development. Forus  official development assistance (ODA) is thedevelopment budget. The maintenance of vital services3to our people through innovative partnerships  such asthe Tuvalu Trust Fund  for example  would not havebeen possible without ODA. I would like at thisjuncture to acknowledge with great sincerity Tuvalu'sappreciation of all its development partners particularly our traditional donors  old and new  such asAustralia  New Zealand  the United Kingdom  Japan the European Union and the Republic of China onTaiwan.For our part  having progressed as a sovereignnation with relative peace and stability over the pasttwenty-four years  Tuvalu is strongly committed to theUnited Nations principle of good governance. Therecently elected Government of Tuvalu is fullycommitted to the principles of good governance democracy and respect for the rule of law. It is alsocommitted to accountability and transparency  inharmony with Christian values and traditional andcultural norms. As in the past  we are also committedto the prudent management of finances and to furtherwork on reforms to improve our systems.Tuvalu is surrounded by the huge Pacific Oceanand is well aware  both of its rights to its vast marineresources and also of its responsibility to ensure theproper and sustainable management of the potentials ofthe ocean. We therefore fully associate ourselves withthe Pacific Islands Forum's Regional Ocean Policyrecently adopted by our leaders.Finally  peace  security and long-term livelihoodfor the world will have no meaning to us in Tuvalu inthe absence of serious actions to address the adverseand devastating effects of global warming. At no morethan three meters above sea level  Tuvalu isparticularly exposed to those effects. Indeed our peopleare already migrating to escape. We are alreadysuffering from the consequences of what worldauthorities on climate change have consistently beenwarning us. Only two weeks ago  a period when theweather was normal and calm and the tide was low unusually big waves suddenly crashed ashore andflooded most parts of the capital island.In the event that the situation is not reversed where does the international community think theTuvalu people can hide from the onslaught of sea-levelrise? Taking us in as environmental refugees is notwhat Tuvalu is after in the long run. We want theislands of Tuvalu and our nation to remain permanentlyand not to be submerged as a result of the greed anduncontrolled consumption of industrialized countries.We want our children to grow up the way we grew upin our own islands and in our own culture.We once again appeal to the industrializedcountries  particularly those who have not done so  tourgently ratify and to fully implement the KyotoProtocol and to provide concrete support in all ouradaptation efforts to cope with the effects of climatechange and sea-level rise. Tuvalu  having little ornothing to do with the causes  cannot be left on its ownto pay the price. We must all work together. May Godbless you all  and God bless the United Nations."
"173",7069,"TZA",57,2002,"﻿Ishould like to begin by congratulating Mr. Kavan onhis well-deserved election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session and toassure him of my delegation's full support andcooperation.I would also like to commend his predecessor Mr. Han Seung-soo  for having skilfully presided overthe work of the fifty-sixth session. Similarly  I wouldlike to express my delegation's sincere appreciation toMr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  for the ablemanner in which he has continued to manage the day-to-day affairs of our Organization in the face ofnumerous and daunting challenges.My delegation wishes to join others in welcomingthe admission to the United Nations of Switzerland  acountry that has done so much for the Organizationover the years. I would also like to welcome EastTimor to the community of nations  following thesuccessful tutelage of the United Nations.As we commemorate the first anniversary of thetragic events of the 11 September terrorist attacks  Iwould like to take this opportunity to reiterateTanzania's solidarity and support for internationalefforts to fight terrorism. Coming from a country thatexperienced a similar tragedy four years ago  Iunderstand the continued pain and suffering of thosewho lost their loved ones as they come to terms withthe aftermath of those tragic events. We have everyconfidence that  through our collective efforts  the waron terrorism will ultimately be won.It is a welcome coincidence that the fifty-seventhsession should be held so soon after the World Summiton Sustainable Development. Tanzania is glad thatpoverty eradication was underscored as humanity'scritical challenge and an indispensable requirement forsustainable development  particularly in the developingcountries.It was very gratifying  indeed  to note that dueregard was also given to the burning issues of15education  health  energy  shelter  water and sanitation as well as agriculture  in particular food security. Theabundance of pledges from all speakers andparticipants to fight poverty  promote social andeconomic development and enhance measures to dealwith pollution and protect the environment was veryreassuring indeed. However  many stakeholders including those from my country  are anxiously waitingto see how we move beyond rhetoric to concrete action.Those of us from the developing countries knowtoo well in this regard that our biggest challenge is toget our act together by practicing and observing goodgovernance  democracy  the rule of law and humanrights. We have to institute sound political  social andeconomic policies  as well as to fight corruption andgraft. We have to create conditions conducive toinvestment flows and trade. Fortunately  this is nolonger wanting  because most of our countries havemade serious efforts to meet these ideals withreasonable success. However  it is frustrating to notethat there is little appreciation of these achievements.Instead  there is amplification of the little that is yet tobe overcome. Many of us feel that we deserve to betreated better.It is surprising also to note the temptation in somequarters to evolve a new paradigm in internationalrelations  that of assigning collective responsibility condemnation and punishment to a region or continentfor the mistakes of one country in that part of theworld. A crisis in an African country  for example  ismeant to be left to African countries to fix and they arethreatened with being held responsible and accountableif that is not done. Several times  we have beenreminded to sort out the problem in some crisis-stricken African countries or else risk losingcooperation on the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD) from the developed countries.Tanzania considers such tendencies not only to bestrange  but also dangerous  unfair  discriminatory andtotally unacceptable. Let all of us continue to worktogether to resolve problems facing our countries andpeoples wherever they may occur.We look forward to seeing the developedcountries of the North play their part  as is expected ofthem  as expressed in the millennium developmentgoals  the Monterrey Consensus  the Brussels Plan ofAction for the least developed countries  the Dohaagreement and the Johannesburg Plan of Action and atyesterday's historic high-level plenary meeting of theGeneral Assembly on support for NEPAD. We considerthe role of the developed countries to be very critical tosuccess in the war against poverty and the attainmentof sustainable development. We look forward to seeingthe countries of the North increase officialdevelopment assistance to the countries of the South.At Monterrey  Kananaskis and Johannesburg there were good signs that this is now possible.However  when one looks at the resource requirementof the millennium goals and the time frame forimplementation  the promises made are far belowtarget. At Monterrey and Kananaskis  some $12 billionwere pledged over a period of three to four years whereas the requirement is $50 billion annually until2015. We appeal to the developed countries to commitmore resources and within the time frames set out inthe millennium development goals.Another important area where the intervention ofthe developed countries is essential is debt relief. Debtservicing is crippling the economies and Governmentsof the poor developing countries. Debt relief releasesresources which can be used to finance priority sectorsand activities  such as education  health  energy  water rural roads and microfinance schemes.Let me take the example of my country  Tanzania.After reaching the completion point for the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and thecancellation of a portion of the external debt Government expenditure on basic social services hasincreased to unprecedented levels. We will now be ableto give clean water to more people than we could havedone in the past. We are now able to hire moreteachers  build more classrooms  take more studentsinto schools and buy more textbooks and teachingmaterials. We have improved health-care deliverysystems. We have hired more medical practitioners inrural dispensaries and health centres and we haveprovided more equipment and medicines. There aremore rural roads maintained now than before and newones are being opened up. The list of benefits is longand we could have done much more if we had got abigger debt-cancellation package. That is why wecontinue to appeal for deeper debt cancellation forTanzania and the rest of the least developed countries.Moreover  the amount of debt that has not beenforgiven to my country is not payable  given our levelof poverty.16Debt cancellation or relief on its own cannotsolve the resource needs of developing countries.Measures to make capital and financial resourcesavailable for investments and trade in the developingcountries are very important. To date  not much hascome to our part of the world  despite our having put inplace the most competitive investment incentives. MayI once again appeal to the Governments of thedeveloped countries to intervene in the most judiciousway possible to encourage investment flows to Africaand the developing countries. I believe that their wordsof encouragement and support will have a positiveimpact.Market access is another very important matterfor us. We highly appreciate and thank the UnitedStates and the European Union for granting duty-freeand quota-free access for goods from Africa and theAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific Group of Statesrespectively. This has acted as an important stimulus toincreased production and investments in our countries.We welcome similar decisions taken by Japan  Canadaand China  thus further expanding Africa's marketaccess. However  agricultural subsidies in thedeveloped countries remain an obstacle to which weagain appeal to the developed countries to give dueconsideration.As we all know  it is in agriculture that we havethe best of the comparative advantage. Unhinderedaccess to the markets of the developed countries therefore  could have immeasurable benefits. I am ofthe view that the developed countries can afford todispense with subsidies to agriculture. Instead  the $1billion spent on such subsidies daily could be used tofund the implementation of millennium developmentgoals.Among today's daunting global challenges are theconflict situations in Africa and the escalation ofviolence in the Middle East. We highly appreciate theproactive role played by the United Nations  countriesof the respective regions and the internationalcommunity in trying to mediate and end the conflicts.We pray for the continued involvement of theinternational community in putting an end to conflicts.The framework for the resumption of negotiationsbetween Israel and the Government of Palestinealready exists. Both sides must create an environmentconducive to negotiations. There has to be an end toIsraeli occupation of Arab lands and significantmovement towards the creation of a viable PalestinianState living side by side with Israel as an imperative tolasting peace in the Middle East. The security concernsof Israel should be addressed and encoded properly inany agreement. In this regard  all relevant SecurityCouncil and General Assembly resolutions must beadhered to.It is our conviction that  without the activeinvolvement of a third party  not much can be achieved.Tanzania is convinced that the Security Council  aswell as the United States  the Russian Federation  theEuropean Union and the Arab League  can play apivotal role in getting to a sustainable solution.Fortunately  all of these are now actively involved. Weappeal to them to remain seized of the problem and tocontinue to work together.The situation in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and Burundi remains a major concern andpreoccupation of Tanzania and other countries in theregion. I want to reaffirm the continued commitmentand readiness of my Government to contribute in anyway possible towards building a peaceful  secure andstable Great Lakes region.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  it isencouraging to note that there are some positivedevelopments following the recent agreement andunderstanding reached between that country  Rwandaand Uganda. It is our hope that the implementation ofthe agreements and understanding will be scrupulouslyobserved. We welcome the undertaking of the UnitedNations and the Republic of South Africa to help theparties.The security situation in Burundi is fragile. Thenew transitional Government installed on 1 November2001 is functioning  but the continuation of the civilwar seems to be undermining its base. Tanzaniaunderscores the significance of getting a ceasefireagreement for the sake of the people of Burundi andthe success of the transitional Government. It was inappreciation of that imperative that my Presidentaccepted the request of the facilitator and that ofPresident Pierre Buyoya of Burundi for Tanzania tohelp urge the rebels to come to the negotiating table.We tried our best and  as a result  the BurundiGovernment and the rebels started direct talks in Dar es17Salaam on 12 August. The negotiations are continuing.They are not easy  but we are confident that they willbe crowned with success. Tanzania will continue toassist in and work for the success of the negotiations.We do so on the clear understanding that we stand togain more from a peaceful and stable Burundi and tolose if there is war and lack of stability. The end of therefugee problem  as well as the end of mistrust betweenour two Governments and the free flow of trade acrossour common borders  are the obvious benefits whichwe long to see realized.One of the serious consequences of the conflictsin the Great Lakes region has been the massivedisplacement of people and the influx of refugees which constitute a huge burden for Tanzania. Atpresent  Tanzania is hosting close to a million refugeesfrom Rwanda  Burundi and the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo. While we appreciate the work being doneby the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian agencies toprotect the refugees  much remains to be done to offsetthe burden which these refugees place upon mycountry. We would like to see more being done tofacilitate repatriation of the refugees.Unfortunately  the 1951 Convention is not aselaborate concerning the responsibilities of refugee-generating countries or those of the internationalcommunity as it is on the responsibilities of therefugee-receiving countries. This is probably due to thecontext in which the Convention was conceived. Thesituation has changed. Tanzania feels strongly thatthere is a need to review the 1951 Convention to keepit in step with changing times and circumstances.The long and protracted war in Angola appears tohave ended. However  Angola still needs the continuedsupport of the international community to deal with thereconstruction and the huge humanitarian crisis facingthe country. Tanzania welcomes the decision oncontinued United Nations involvement.With regard to Western Sahara  Tanzania firmlybelieves that the United Nations cannot  and must not retreat from this unfinished agenda. Tanzania wishes toreiterate its longstanding support for the efforts of theUnited Nations  which will enable the Sahrawi peopleto exercise their right to self-determination.While we appreciate the progress made in thereform of the working methods of the Security Council we remain concerned that no movement has beenrecorded in the area of expansion of membership.Tanzania would like to reiterate its support for Africa'squest for two permanent seats.In his address to the Assembly on 4 October1996  my President  Mr. Benjamin Mkapa  said:The founding of the United Nations was inspiredby the human solidarity which the world soughtto promote five decades ago... What holds ournations together  despite their diversity  is thecommon bond and solidarity we feel for eachother as human beings. Today  more than everbefore  we need that solidarity in order to dealwith the myriad problems we all face together'.These words were relevant then  and they are stillrelevant today."
"174",7112,"UGA",57,2002,"﻿On behalf of thedelegation of Uganda  I congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to preside over the deliberations of the fifty-seventh regular session of the General Assembly. Weexpress appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. HanSeung-Soo  for a job well done. We also congratulatethe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for theoutstanding work he continues to perform on behalf ofthe United Nations and the international community.Uganda welcomes to the membership of the UnitedNations two new members  the Democratic Republic of5East Timor  which is soon to become a Member  and theSwiss Confederation  whose admission to the UnitedNations brings closer to realization the goal ofuniversality of membership of this global Organization.One year after the tragic events of 11 September2001  the primary role of the United Nations to maintaininternational peace and security must be strengthened  inorder to ensure that the tragedy that befell New York Cityand Washington D.C.  last year is not repeated anywhereon this globe. The United Nations  together with allMember States  must make every effort to eradicate thescourge of terrorism from the world. The Governmentand people of Uganda stand united with all peace-loving countries of the world in condemning andresisting acts of terrorism carried out by cowardly andbarbaric forces. The use of indiscriminate violencecannot be justified under any circumstances and therefore  must be roundly condemned.The people of Uganda have been victims ofsenseless acts of terrorism perpetrated by terroristgroups such as the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) andthe Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) for many years.Uganda is committed to efforts to bring theperpetrators of terrorism and their collaborators tojustice. Uganda is ready to cooperate with othercountries in the implementation of the provisions ofexisting international anti-terrorist conventions  as wellas the conclusion of new international instruments tocounter terrorism comprehensively.At the domestic level  Uganda recently enacted alaw called the Suppression of Terrorism Act. Theenactment of that law is clear testimony to thecommitment of the Government of Uganda to fightterrorism both at home and abroad.The scourge of conflicts on the African continenthas for decades been one of the major contributors tosocio-economic decline  causing untold suffering  ascivilian populations are forced into living as refugeesand internally displaced persons.Bearing that in mind  we welcome the historicdecision of the inaugural Assembly of the AfricanUnion to establish the Peace and Security Council ofthe African Union to deal with the scourge of conflictsin Africa and to ensure that peace  stability andsecurity prevail on the African continent. Uganda hasduly signed the Protocol relating to the establishmentof the Peace and Security Council. As a collectivesecurity and early-warning body  the Peace andSecurity Council will enhance Africa's capacity tomanage conflicts by facilitating timely and efficientresponse to conflict and crisis situations on thecontinent. I wish to call upon our development partnersand upon the international community at large tosupport Africa in this new endeavour.In conformity with our commitment to restorepeace and stability in the Great Lakes region  andconsistent with the spirit of the Lusaka CeasefireAgreement  the Presidents of Uganda and the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo signed an Agreement in Luanda Angola  on 6 September 2002. That agreement providesfor total withdrawal of Ugandan troops from the territoryof the Democratic Republic of the Congo  normalizationof relations and cooperation in the economic and socialfields. Under the Agreement  Uganda undertakes towithdraw all its troops from Beni  Gbadolite and Buniawithin a period of 100 days. As of now  we havewithdrawn all our troops from Beni  and by the weekendwe shall have no troops in Gbadolite. At the same time the two countries agreed to establish a joint securitymechanism for the western slopes of the Rwenzorimountains in order to address Uganda's security concerns.Also of importance is the undertaking by the parties torefrain from all types of military and logistical support— including the provision of bases and sanctuary toarmed groups  inter-ethnic militias  subversiveorganizations and all rebel movements — against eachother. Uganda is indebted to the Government of TheRepublic of Angola for its crucial engagement  whichled to that breakthrough.As Chair of the regional initiative on Burundi Uganda has played a leading role in efforts to find ajust and lasting solution to the internal conflict inBurundi. We welcome the conclusion of the ArushaPeace Accord  and I should like to appeal to all theparties to honour the ceasefire and to support fullyefforts to implement the Arusha Accord. I thank  in thatregard  the Governments of South Africa  Tanzania andGabon for their tireless efforts. In addition  we paytribute to former President Nelson Mandela of SouthAfrica for his role as Facilitator. Uganda and the othercountries in the region will continue to exert everyeffort to bring about peace and stability in Burundi. Wecall upon the United Nations and the rest of theinternational community to support our efforts torestore peace in Burundi.Since the Nairobi Agreement  signed inDecember 1999 between the Governments of the Sudan6and Uganda and facilitated by former President JimmyCarter of the United States and by President Danielarap Moi of Kenya  relations between Sudan andUganda have continued to witness steady andsatisfactory progress. To date  the Sudan and Ugandahave agreed to restore cooperation in the political security and diplomatic fields. We have also agreed toestablish a joint ministerial commission to overseefurther cooperation in all areas.Uganda strongly supports and is activelyparticipating in the negotiations initiated by theIntergovernmental Authority on Development aimed atresolving the conflict between the Government of theSudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLM/SPLA)  whichculminated in the breakthrough of the MachakosProtocol on 20 July 2002. Indeed  it was in the spirit ofhopeful anticipation of peace that President Musevenihosted a historic meeting in Kampala on 27 July 2002between President Al-Bashir of the Sudan and theChairman of the SPLM/SPLA  Dr. John Garang deMabior. Therefore  it is extremely unfortunate andregrettable that the second phase of the Machakosnegotiations between the two Sudanese parties hasstalled. The Government of Uganda calls upon theinternational community  especially the countries of theregion  to demand a return to the negotiating table bythe Sudanese parties so that a comprehensive  just andlasting settlement can be reached.The situation in Somalia continues to be volatileand the prospects for peace elusive. Following the Artaagreement and the formation of the TransitionalNational Government of Somalia  the position of Ugandahas been to encourage the reconciliation process and anall-inclusive and broad-based administration for thatcountry. It is in that context that Uganda looks forward tothe convening of the forthcoming Somali peace andreconciliation conference  which is due to start inNairobi  Kenya  on 15 October 2002.Uganda is concerned at the lack of progress inefforts to find a just and permanent solution to thequestion of Western Sahara  which has remainedunresolved since the former colonial Power abandonedthe territory in 1975. We urge the United Nations tohold  as soon as possible  a referendum to enable theSaharawi people to exercise their inalienable right toself-determination  in accordance with the relevantGeneral Assembly resolutions.Uganda supports the right of the Palestinianpeople to a homeland  and we appeal to the two partiesto resume negotiations with a view to finding a just andlasting solution to the Middle East crisis. Ugandasupports the establishment of a Palestinian State toexist side by side in peace with the State of Israel.Uganda participated actively and at the highestlevel at the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  held at Johannesburg  South Africa. TheSummit was clearly one of this year's major events inthe field of development. Uganda welcomes theoutcome of that conference  which reaffirmed theprinciples and priorities of Agenda 21. In focusing onpoverty eradication  the Summit established theessential integration of the three concepts of people planet and prosperity. We believe that the challengenow before the international community is toimplement  fully and expeditiously  the concreteagreements reached at the conference. This session ofthe General Assembly must  therefore  translate theaspirations of the developing countries expressed at theconference into reality. We believe that all countrieshave an obligation to implement the Johannesburg Planof Action and Declaration on sustainable developmentand  by so doing  to contribute towards the achievementof the Millennium Development Goals  adopted by theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.Uganda welcomes the international consensusreached at Monterrey in March this year  including newdevelopment assistance commitments for financing thedevelopment of developing countries. We appeal to ourdevelopment partners and to international financialinstitutions to provide additional resources and tohonour the agreed targets for official developmentassistance. The priority accorded to the eradication ofpoverty by the Millennium Summit and  in particular the goal of reducing poverty by half by 2015 will notbe realized unless all countries — especially developedcountries — honour the obligations and commitments thathave been agreed to by the international community.Uganda is committed to fulfilling the objectivesand goals of the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD). In that connection  wewelcome the Group of Eight (G-8) Africa Action Plan adopted by the heads of State or Government of theeight major industrialized countries at their Summit atKananaskis  Canada. NEPAD recognizes that theprimary responsibility for Africa's future and for itsdevelopment rests with Africans  but Africa needs7support from its development partners. It is against thatbackground that Uganda appreciates the commitmentmade by the G-8 Governments to mobilize andenergize global action  to marshal resources andexpertise  and to provide impetus in support ofNEPAD's objectives. We welcome the adoption of theUnited Nations Declaration on the New Partnership forAfrica's Development by this session of the GeneralAssembly (resolution 57/2) and the overwhelmingsupport that NEPAD has received from theinternational community.Uganda believes that trade — especially free andfair trade — is the engine of growth and development.In that regard  we urge the international community tomake every effort to ensure that the multilateral tradingsystem caters for the special needs of the leastdeveloped countries with practical measures that canimprove their terms of trade  enhance their exportcapacity and sustain their balance of payments.The major agricultural products of the leastdeveloped countries  such as coffee  cotton  bananasand tea  are exported to several markets  notably theEuropean Union  the United States of America andCanada. Because of that fact  conditions of marketaccess are of critical importance for defining thetrading opportunities of the least developed countries.While Uganda welcomes the African Growth andOpportunity Act adopted by the United States and theEuropean Union's Everything But Arms initiative  webelieve these positive developments should becomplemented by simplified rules of origin andcoordinated programmes of assistance by the donorcommunity to increase the capacity of least developedcountries to produce and market more. We areencouraged by Canada's unilateral decision to lifttariffs on African exports to Canada and to abolishsubsidies on agricultural products. We urge othercountries to emulate this positive example.The collapse of commodity prices has contributedto a drastic decline in the terms of trade of the leastdeveloped countries. This matter deserves urgentattention by the international community if the leastdeveloped countries are to be fully integrated into themultilateral trading system. We call upon the internationalcommunity to implement fully the provisions of theDoha Declaration in favour of the least developedcountries and  in addition  to provide technical supportto build their capacity in ongoing negotiations.In the short term  aid can be — indeed  it hasbeen — beneficial for the development of developingcountries. In that respect  Uganda would like to appealto the donor countries to make the necessary effort tohonour the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product for official development assistance.We thank those countries which have already reachedor even surpassed that target.I would like to say that Uganda supports theSecretary-General's efforts to reform the UnitedNations system to make it more efficient and effective.Reform of the Security Council is  however  longoverdue. We appeal to all Member States to expeditethe process of reform  including the expansion of theCouncil's membership in its permanent and non-permanent categories.Finally  I would like to reiterate Uganda's fullcommitment to multilateralism and to the principlesand purposes of the United Nations. We are ready tomake every effort to achieve the lofty goals set by theinternational community at the Millennium Summit."
"175",7159,"UKR",57,2002,"﻿It is a great honour andpleasure to congratulate the representative of the Groupof Eastern European States on his election to the highpost of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. On behalf of the delegation ofUkraine  let me wish him success and assure him of oursupport. I would like to address words of respect andgratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Han Seung-soo.I would like to take this opportunity to conveycordial congratulations to a new  welcome Member ofthe United Nations  the Swiss Confederation. We lookforward also to welcoming the Democratic Republic ofEast Timor as a Member of the United Nations shortly.18We consider the joining of the United Nations by thoseStates a truly historic event which testifies to theviability of our great family of nations.The first days of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly began with a commemoration of thevictims of the horrible terrorist acts of 11 September2001. Over the past year we have repeatedly reflectedon whether those events would remain a tragic momentin history  or whether they would prove to be a turningpoint. We have been searching for an answer to aquestion representing the most difficult challenge tohumankind: how to preserve the fundamental right ofevery person — the right to life.For Ukraine  “terror” and “terrorism” are not justwords. For decades  the Ukrainian people lived underthe oppression of terror  which was raised to the rankof State policy. Next year Ukraine will commemoratethe seventieth anniversary of the induced famine whichin 1932 and 1933 took the lives of over 7 millionUkrainians. That most tragic event in our modernhistory  caused by the totalitarian regime  was a brutalact of genocide against the Ukrainian nation. At thattime the world failed to respond to our tragedy. Nor didit recognize early enough the face of fascism: certainpoliticians and certain States thought that that evilwould bypass them. The consequences of that inactionturned out to be enormous.Today  at the beginning of a new millennium  Iam confident that each of us would like to rely uponthe encouraging momentum of change which has takenplace in the international arena  and to rely upon theunifying force with which the world responded to theevents of 11 September 2001. In the face of thechallenge of terrorism  the international communitydemonstrated its determination and resolve. Tangibleresults have been achieved by the antiterrorismcoalition.We regard the fight against terrorism as one of theaspect of a broad and long-term process ofcomprehensive international action aimed at abolishingthe philosophy of hatred and intolerance  which isexacerbated by conflicts in various regions of theworld.The need for a new philosophy is particularlyacute on the security front: success of the internationalpresence in Afghanistan  the completion of thepeacekeeping mission in East Timor and normalizationin the Balkans are taking place alongside the dramaticdevelopments in the Middle East  the so-called frozenconflicts in the post-Soviet space  which remainunresolved  and persistent security problems in Africa.In this context  the United Nations has no right to limititself to passive observation and uninvolved analysis.At the Millennium Summit  the President ofUkraine  Leonid Kuchma  put forward an initiative ondeveloping a comprehensive United Nations strategyfor conflict prevention. We hope that ongoingdiscussions in the United Nations on therecommendations made by the Secretary-General onthis issue will contribute to a real shift from a cultureof reaction to a culture of prevention.The United Nations is capable of utilizing itsconsolidating force to strengthen the legal basis ofinternational relations. We highly value the UnitedNations contribution to this process that brought intoforce the Rome Statute and led to the establishment ofthe International Criminal Court. Today  it is highlyimportant to ensure the effectiveness of the Court andto preserve the integrity of its Statute.Another priority task in this sphere is to concludethe elaboration of a comprehensive convention oninternational terrorism. This year Ukraine became aparty to the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings and the EuropeanConvention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Upon thecompletion of relevant domestic procedures on theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism  Ukraine will be a party to all12 universal instruments against terrorism.A number of tasks facing the internationalcommunity in the social and economic spheres arefurther defining the role of the United Nations as aunique forum for dialogue among developed countries countries with economies in transition and developingnations.As a member of the Economic and SocialCouncil  Ukraine stresses the need for reform of theCouncil and for strengthening its coordinating role.That process would  inter alia  significantly strengthenthe Organization's potential to ensure consistent andeffective implementation of the provisions of theMillennium Declaration  the Monterrey Consensus andthe outcome of the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  held in Johannesburg.19At the Johannesburg Summit  the President ofUkraine proposed the formulation of innovativefinancial stimulation mechanisms for developingcountries and countries with economies in transition  inparticular through debt-for-sustainable-developmentswaps. In our view  such steps would have a positiveimpact on nations' rates of economic growth andecologically responsible development.On 31 December 2001 Ukraine concluded itstwo-year term of membership of the Security Council.As a member of the Council  our country strived tomake practical contributions towards finding solutionsto critical security problems in many regions of today'sworld. Our country's position of principle is still thatthe Security Council is the only organ with thelegitimate right to decide on the use of force  inaccordance with the United Nations Charter. At thesame time we consistently stand for increasedtransparency in the Council's work  and we hope thatprogress on internal changes will allow the process ofcomprehensive and long-awaited reform to start.An important element of Ukraine's participationin United Nations efforts in the sphere of peace andsecurity will continue to be its contribution topeacekeeping activities of the Organization. We believethat the key role played by United Nationspeacekeeping operations and the personal contributionmade by each peacekeeper deserve adequaterecognition by the international community. I amconfident that everybody present in this Hall will shareour view. At the current session of the GeneralAssembly  Ukraine will present a draft resolutionproposing annual observance of an International Day ofUnited Nations Peacekeepers as a way to pay tribute tothe memory of fallen peacekeepers and to honour theparticipants in ongoing and past missions. We hope thiswill be unanimously supported.Ukraine views positively the advancement of thestabilization process in the Balkans  in particular inBosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo. Ukraine holdsto a consistent position concerning the territorialintegrity and inviolability of the borders of the BalkanStates  and it fully supports the active involvement ofEuropean actors in an effort to further normalize thesecurity situation in the region.In contrast to a promising assessment of thesituation in the Balkans  we are compelled to voice ourregret over the absence of progress in the settlement ofother problems which are of particular interest toUkraine. Among them is the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.The absence of confidence between the Georgian andthe Abkhaz sides stands in the way of a renewal ofpolitical dialogue. As host country to the third meetingof the sides on confidence-building measures  whichwas held in Yalta in March 2001  Ukraine stands readyto take practical steps  in cooperation with the UnitedNations and other interested States  in order to renewthe spirit of Yalta.Speaking of the situation in Georgia  I cannot failto mention that Ukraine is deeply concerned at thesituation related to developments in the Pankisi valley.Ukraine believes that the existing misunderstandingscan be resolved only through peaceful means  incompliance with the norms and principles ofinternational law. We call upon the parties to employall available political and diplomatic mechanisms toarrive at a mutual understanding and to take advantageof every opportunity to achieve détente in the currentsituation. Ukraine unconditionally supports thesovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.The situation in the Middle East also remains asource of deep concern for Ukraine. It is quite obvioustoday that the parties have become trapped in a cycle ofviolence  which contradicts the true aspirations of bothpeoples and breeds yet more hatred and desperation.We fully support the efforts of the internationalcommunity  in particular the Quartet and the countriesof the region  aimed at assisting the parties in findingpeaceful ways to settle the conflict. Ukraine  for itspart  strives to contribute in every possible way to apeaceful settlement. In April this year  during his visitto the region  President Leonid Kuchma presentedUkrainian proposals in the framework of internationaldiplomatic efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement of theMiddle East conflict; these envisage a range of parallelsteps in the security  economic and political spheres. Ishould like to take this opportunity to confirmUkraine's readiness to offer a venue on its territory andto provide all appropriate conditions for the conduct oftalks on this issue. The achievement of a final  just anddurable peace in the Middle East is not possiblewithout the resumption of peace negotiations on theIsraeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese tracks.The development of the situation concerning Iraqcannot fail to cause serious concern. We rely on thepotential of the United Nations to solve this problem.The resolutions of the Security Council should be fullyimplemented. We expect that the new round ofnegotiations between the United Nations and Iraq willhelp to find ways to resolve this issue.Today  the world looks with hope to theunprecedented integration process on the Africancontinent. We hope that the birth of the African Unionwill strengthen the spirit of African brotherhood andunity in responding to the numerous challenges thatconfront the continent: armed conflict  poverty and theHIV/AIDS pandemic. Ukraine welcomes the AfricanUnion's establishment and its far-reaching plans torevitalize the continent. We hope that the NewPartnership for Africa's Development will unite thenations of the world in a global partnership in supportof peace  stability and development on the Africancontinent. For its part  Ukraine is ready to continue tostrengthen its cooperation and expand its economic tieswith the countries of a united Africa  including in theframework of the new global partnership for thedevelopment of the continent.Ensuring the proper implementation of theprinciples of the supremacy of law  the creation ofconditions for economic growth and the effectivefunctioning of the institutions of an open society aregoals that remain fundamental in Ukraine's nationalpolicy. The President of Ukraine has launched aprogramme of political reforms to ensure a transition toa parliamentary-presidential form of governance. Thatprocess should bring about the further democratizationof our society and should lead to consolidation of alldomestic resources in order to achieve Europeanstandards and to strengthen concord in Ukrainiansociety. Our determined strategic goal is to become amember of the European Union and of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization  which should finallyensure the indivisibility of the European political economic and security space. Our course of action isaimed at making Ukraine a pillar of political stability economic prosperity and cultural renaissance.Here  I cannot fail to mention a tragic problem forUkraine that is related to the consequences of theChernobyl disaster. Our country must address —virtually on its own — a complex set of technological social and economic problems connected to themitigation of that disaster's consequences as well as tothe closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in2000. We expect that our efforts will be supported byconcrete action on the part of the internationalcommunity  in particular through the implementation ofthe new United Nations strategy for Chernobyl.Guided by the aspiration to achieve practicalresults  we are also determined to solve a broad rangeof other problems that have an important place on theagenda of the world forum. Undoubtedly  the fightagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic is one of the mostchallenging of these. I should like to inform theAssembly that a regional conference for the countriesof Eastern Europe and Central Asia will be held inUkraine in November this year with the support of theUnited Nations and of other international partners.I am confident that  a year after the 11 Septembertragedy in the United States  each of us realizes theparticular significance of the tasks facing the UnitedNations. Looking ahead to the new challenges  we hopethat  in the cause of protecting civilization's values  weshall be guided by our wisdom  which will allow us toavoid tragic scenarios and to protect the rights of everyinhabitant of the planet  including every new humanbeing who comes into the world even as we speak inthis debate: the right to life  the right to dignity  theright to this world."
"176",7206,"URY",57,2002,"﻿Theprofound and dizzying change that took place in theworld during the last decade  with the end of the coldwar and the acceleration of the process ofglobalization  did not bring with it the idealinternational society for which we had hoped  andworld peace now seems as elusive as ever. That is thegreat challenge the Organization must face as we beginanother session of the General Assembly  whoserelevance as a coordinating body for the internationalcommunity is again being put to the test.The events of September 2001 radically changedthe perception of security in the world. The main threatto international peace and stability now comes in theform of organized multinational clandestine groupswhich  having wide access to weapons and financialresources  seek to sow terror with a total lack of basichuman feeling.Despite its cultural and religious diversity and thediversity of its political systems  and notwithstandingthe marked differences in levels of development  theinternational community reacted to terrorism with adeep and resolute sense of solidarity  which is reflectedin its decision to combat it vigorously within theframework of international law  through the relevantconventions and fulfilment of the obligations stemmingfrom the Security Council  based on the principles ofthe Charter and on respect for human rights. In facingthat scourge  we must not forget what the President ofUruguay  Jorge Batlle  said in his address to theGeneral Assembly last year in reference to terrorism:to fight it  it will also be necessary to moveagainst other enemies of peace  such as povertyand underdevelopment  to give to every persongood reason to live and to make all of usguardians of humankind  which is a commongood from which no one must feel excluded  andfor which we must fight unwaveringly'.(A/56/PV.44  p. 19)It must also be borne in mind that that ubiquitousand anonymous enemy  terrorism  invokespolitical pretexts related to unresolved conflicts. In thatregard  Uruguay reiterates its confidence that thePalestinian authorities will show proof of their peacefulaspirations through their acts. At the same time  we callon the Government of Israel to make all the effortsnecessary to return to the negotiating table  as the onlyway to achieve lasting peace.We retain our optimism in the face of all thosechallenges. We wish to highlight two positivedevelopments that demonstrate that the internationalcommunity is moving in the right direction: the first isthe establishment of the International Criminal Court(ICC)  which will contribute to the maintenance ofpeace by preventing  deterring and punishing the mostserious international crimes that individuals cancommit.My country  Uruguay  by signing and ratifyingthe Rome Statute  indicated its willingness tocontribute to the important process of the developmentand strengthening of international law through theestablishment of permanent legal institutions.Secondly  the world has this year laid thegroundwork for the management of the broad spectrumof the positive and negative effects of globalization.The recent Summit on Sustainable Developmentrepresents the culmination of a process thatcomplements the results of the Monterrey Summit onFinancing for Development and the MinisterialConference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) held at Doha  which will enable the internationalcommunity to coordinate its efforts to eradicate povertyand to promote global development by increasing21development assistance and liberalizing trade in asustainable manner.The overall conclusion to be drawn from theseconferences is clear. If the developing countries are notgiven equal opportunities and conditions  both withrespect to the elimination of subsidies and unfair tradepractices and with respect to market access  then thosecountries  the particularly small and developingcountries  will continue to suffer the negative effectsof globalization without enjoying its benefits  therebyaggravating the political  social and economic situationin the vast majority of States in the internationalcommunity. This is the path to deadlock.Uruguay  with its firm commitment tomultilateralism  belongs  at the regional level  to theSouthern Common Market (MERCOSUR)  togetherwith Argentina  Brazil and Paraguay  as well as Boliviaand Chile. MERCOSUR  which is now a decade old it has been in existence since the AsunciÛn Treaty of1991  has established itself as an effective actorwithin the international community  going beyond thedimension of an economic project to play an active roleas a stabilizer of democracy in the region  thusconsolidating the rule of law and full respect forfundamental freedoms and human rights.It is therefore as a member of MERCOSUR thatUruguay has opted for an ambitious policy of tradeliberalization characterized by the principle oftransparency. It hopes that the other trading blocs in thedeveloped world will apply the same principles andavoid the duplicity inherent in advocating the need topromote free trade on the one hand  while at the sametime protecting one's markets with discriminatorypractices. We therefore ask for reciprocity from ourtrading partners.We must not forget that this is the reason why weare now facing increasing difficulty in achieving ourdevelopment goals. Uruguay  like many other countriesin other regions of the world  is experiencing aneconomic and financial crisis that was completelyunavoidable as a result of the severe impact ofregional  extra-regional and external factors. This wasattributable to our increasing dependency on foreigntrade  to the fall in the international prices of ourproducts  to the implementation of subsidies and toother protectionist measures by the developedcountries  and to the rapid spread of the crisis in thefinancial systems of the main exporting markets.To this we must add another tragic irony. Ourexport products  which are mainly agricultural  cannotcompete with similar goods from other countriesbecause of their higher cost  which results from the factthat Uruguay fulfils all of its international obligationsin the labour and social fields  particularly with regardto child labour  the work of women  the minimumwage  social benefits and working conditions.Nevertheless  the developed countries preach respectfor human rights  the strengthening of social securityand the fulfilment of those obligations  while at thesame time purchasing products that are produced atlower cost  in violation of international legalobligations.The phenomenon of globalization  which hasdeveloped thus far without a proper cooperationframework  appears to be the cause of many of theseproblems. We continue to believe that it is within thisOrganization that we must continue to explore waysthat will lead to a political solution to the principalproblems that we all face.On the one hand the United Nations is theobvious body to manage the impact of globalization. Inthis process of constant change  which is accelerated no doubt  by the technological advances of the so-called information society  we recognize thepotential that information technology innovations havefor the development of democracy and the economy aswell as social progress  and we note with great interestthat the World Summit on the Information Society willbe held next year.Furthermore  we must bring to life once again thetrue purpose and meaning of international economiccooperation. True solidarity is reflected not only in theundertaking of commitments at international summitsand conferences. It is expressed above all in thefaithful discharge of these commitments by each State in particular developed countries. This is the only wayin which developing countries can move beyond theirlow levels of progress and achieve sustainabledevelopment.All of this requires the introduction of changes inthe organs and in the procedures of the United Nationsin order to ensure better representativity in its structureand to enhance the efficiency of its functioning. Thereform of the Security Council and the revitalization ofthe General Assembly are tasks that are still pendingand which we must continue to pursue.22Uruguay has confidence in multilateralmechanisms for preserving and building internationalpeace and security. It is a signatory to the SanFrancisco Charter and since 1952 has contributedtroops to 13 United Nations peacekeeping missions.We take pride in the fact that the more than 1 500members of our military and police forces currentlyparticipating in peacekeeping operations represent thisfirm commitment and our belief in this Organization.Therefore Uruguay shares in its entirety theeloquent and passionate advocacy of multilateralismreflected in the Secretary-General's statement last weekin this very Hall. Like Mr. Kofi Annan  the people andthe Government of Uruguay reaffirm their genuinecommitment to multilateralism  deeply rooted in ourspirit and based on principle  on tradition and onconviction.The most recent political developments  in termsof the crisis posed by Iraq  is in our view proof of theneed for balance which can be achieved only within theframework of mutilateralism.In conclusion  I should like to warmly andsincerely congratulate you  Sir  on the manner in whichyou have been accomplishing your work  which weknow will be successful. We also welcome the two newMembers who are joining the Organization  theSwiss Confederation and Timor-Leste. We know thatunder your leadership  this will be a fruitful andsuccessful session of the Assembly."
"177",7253,"USA",57,2002,"﻿We meet one year and one dayafter a terrorist attack brought grief to my country andbrought grief to many citizens of our world. Yesterday we remembered the innocent lives taken that terriblemorning. Today we turn to the urgent duty ofprotecting other lives without illusion and without fear.We have accomplished much in the last year — inAfghanistan and beyond. We have much yet to do — inAfghanistan and beyond. Many nations representedhere have joined in the fight against global terror  andthe people of the United States are grateful.The United Nations was born in the hope thatsurvived a world war — the hope of a world movingtowards justice  escaping old patterns of conflict andfear. The founding Members resolved that the peace ofthe world must never again be destroyed by the willand the wickedness of any man. We created the UnitedNations Security Council so that  unlike the League ofNations  our deliberations would be more than talk  ourresolutions would be more than wishes. Aftergenerations of deceitful dictators  broken treaties andsquandered lives  we dedicated ourselves to standardsof human dignity  shared by all  and to a system ofsecurity defended by all.Today  these standards  and this security  arechallenged.Our commitment to human dignity is challengedby persistent poverty and raging disease. The sufferingis great  and our responsibilities are clear. The UnitedStates is joining with the world to supply aid where itreaches people and lifts up lives  to extend trade andthe prosperity it brings  and to bring medical carewhere it is desperately needed.As a symbol of our commitment to humandignity  the United States will return to the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO). This organization has beenreformed  and America will participate fully in itsmission to advance human rights  tolerance andlearning.Our common security is challenged by regionalconflicts — ethnic and religious strife that is ancient but not inevitable. In the Middle East  there can be nopeace for either side without freedom for both sides.America stands committed to an independent anddemocratic Palestine  living side by side with Israel inpeace and security. Like all other people  Palestiniansdeserve a government that serves their interests andlistens to their voices. My nation will continue toencourage all parties to step up to their responsibilitiesas we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to theconflict.Above all  our principles and our security arechallenged today by outlaw groups and regimes thataccept no law of morality and have no limit to theirviolent ambitions. In the attacks on America a yearago  we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies.This threat hides within many nations  including myown. In cells and camps  terrorists are plotting furtherdestruction and are building new bases for their waragainst civilization. And our greatest fear is thatterrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitionswhen an outlaw regime supplies them with thetechnologies enabling them to kill on a massive scale.In one place  in one regime  we find all thesedangers  in their most lethal and aggressive forms —exactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nationswas born to confront. Twelve years ago  Iraq invadedKuwait without provocation. And the regime's forceswere poised to continue their march to seize othercountries and their resources. Had Saddam Husseinbeen appeased instead of stopped  he would haveendangered the peace and stability of the world. Yet this aggression was stopped by the might of coalitionforces and the will of the United Nations.In order to suspend hostilities and to sparehimself  Iraq's dictator accepted a series ofcommitments. The terms were clear to him  and to all.And he agreed to prove that he is complying with everyone of those obligations. He has proven instead onlyhis contempt for the United Nations and for all hispledges. By breaking every pledge  by his deceptionsand by his cruelties  Saddam Hussein has made thecase against himself.In 1991  Security Council resolution 688 (1991)demanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once therepression of its own people  including the systematicrepression of minorities  which the Council said “threaten[ed] international peace and security in theregion”.This demand goes ignored. Last year  the UnitedNations Commission on Human Rights found that Iraqcontinues to commit extremely grave violations ofhuman rights and that the regime's repression is allpervasive. Tens of thousands of political opponents and7ordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrestand imprisonment  summary execution  and torture bybeating  burning  electric shock  starvation  mutilationand rape. Wives are tortured in front of their husbands;children in the presence of their parents; and all ofthese horrors are concealed from the world by theapparatus of a totalitarian State.In 1991  the United Nations Security Council through its resolutions 686 (1991) and 687 (1991) demanded that Iraq return all prisoners from Kuwaitand other lands. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke thispromise. Last year the Secretary-General's high-levelcoordinator for this issue reported that Kuwaiti  Saudi Indian  Syrian  Lebanese  Iranian  Egyptian  Bahraini and Omani nationals remain unaccounted for — morethan 600 people. One American pilot is among them.In 1991  the United Nations Security Council through resolution 687 (1991)  demanded that Iraqrenounce all involvement with terrorism and permit noterrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Iraq's regimeagreed. It broke this promise. In violation of SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  Iraq continues toshelter and support terrorist organizations that directviolence against Iran  Israel  and WesternGovernments. Iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted formurder. In 1993  Iraq attempted to assassinate the Emirof Kuwait and a former American President. Iraq'sGovernment openly praised the attacks of 11September. Al-Qaida terrorists have escaped fromAfghanistan and are known to be in Iraq.In 1991  the Iraqi regime agreed to destroy and tostop developing all weapons of mass destruction andlong-range missiles  and to prove to the world it hasdone so by complying with rigorous inspections. Iraqhas broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge.From 1991 to 1995  the Iraqi regime said it hadno biological weapons. After a senior official in itsweapons program defected and exposed this lie  theregime admitted to producing tens of thousands oflitres of anthrax and other deadly biological agents foruse in Scud missile warheads  aerial bombs and aircraftspray tanks. United Nations inspectors believe Iraq hasproduced two to four times the amount of biologicalagents it declared and has failed to account for morethan three metric tons of material that could be used toproduce biological weapons. Right now  Iraq isexpanding and improving facilities that were used forthe production of biological weapons.United Nations inspections also reveal that Iraqlikely maintains stockpiles of VX  mustard and otherchemical agents  and that the regime is rebuilding andexpanding facilities capable of producing chemicalweapons.And in 1995  after four years of deception  Iraqfinally admitted that it had had a crash nuclearweapons programme prior to the Gulf war. We knownow that  were it not for that war  the regime in Iraqwould likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no laterthan 1993.Today  Iraq continues to withhold importantinformation about its nuclear programme: weaponsdesign  procurement logs  experiment data  anaccounting of nuclear materials and documentation offoreign assistance. Iraq employs capable nuclearscientists and technicians. It retains physicalinfrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iraqhas made several attempts to buy high-strengthaluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclearweapon. Should Iraq acquire fissile material  it wouldbe able to build a nuclear weapon within a year. AndIraq's State-controlled media have reported numerousmeetings between Saddam Hussein and his nuclearscientists  leaving little doubt about his continuedappetite for these weapons.Iraq also possesses a force of Scud-type missileswith ranges beyond the 150 kilometres permitted by theUnited Nations. Work at testing and productionfacilities shows that Iraq is building more long-rangemissiles that can inflict mass death throughout theregion.In 1990  after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait  theworld imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Thosesanctions were maintained after the war to compel theregime's compliance with Security Council resolutions.In time  Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buyfood. Saddam Hussein has subverted that programme working around the sanctions to buy missiletechnology and military materials. He blames thesuffering of Iraq's people on the United Nations  evenas he uses his oil wealth to build lavish palaces forhimself and to buy arms for his country. By refusing tocomply with his own agreements  he bears full guilt forthe hunger and misery of innocent Iraqi citizens.In 1991  Iraq promised United Nations inspectorsimmediate and unrestricted access to verify Iraq'scommitment to rid itself of weapons of mass8destruction and long-range missiles. Iraq broke thatpromise  spending seven years deceiving  evading andharassing United Nations inspectors before ceasingcooperation entirely. Just months after the 1991ceasefire  the Security Council twice renewed itsdemand that the Iraqi regime cooperate fully withinspectors  condemning Iraq's serious violations of itsobligations. The Security Council again renewed thatdemand in 1994 and twice more in 1996  deploringIraq's clear violations of its obligations. The SecurityCouncil renewed its demand three more times in 1997 citing flagrant violations  and three more times in1998  calling Iraq's behaviour totally unacceptable.And in 1999  the demand was renewed yet again.As we meet today  it has been almost four yearssince the last United Nations inspector set foot inIraq — four years for the Iraqi regime to plan and tobuild and to test behind the cloak of secrecy. We knowthat Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murdereven when inspectors were in his country. Are we toassume that he stopped when they left? The history  thelogic and the facts lead to one conclusion. SaddamHussein's regime is a grave and gathering danger. Tosuggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. Toassume this regime's good faith is to bet the lives ofmillions and the peace of the world in a recklessgamble. And that is a risk we must not take.We have been more than patient. We have triedsanctions. We have tried the carrot of oil-for-food andthe stick of coalition military strikes. But SaddamHussein has defied all those efforts and continues todevelop weapons of mass destruction. The first time wemay be completely certain he has nuclear weapons iswhen  God forbid  he uses one. We owe it to all ourcitizens to do everything in our power to prevent thatday from coming.The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to theauthority of the United Nations and a threat to peace.Iraq has answered a decade of United Nations demandswith a decade of defiance. All the world now faces atest and the United Nations a difficult and definingmoment. Are Security Council resolutions to behonoured and enforced or cast aside withoutconsequence? Will the United Nations serve thepurpose of its founding  or will it be irrelevant?The United States helped found the UnitedNations. We want the United Nations to be effectiveand respected and successful. We want the resolutionsof the world's most important multilateral body to beenforced  and right now those resolutions are beingunilaterally subverted by the Iraqi regime. Ourpartnership of nations can meet the test before us bymaking clear what we now expect of the Iraqi regime.If the Iraqi regime wishes peace  it willimmediately and unconditionally forswear  discloseand remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction long-range missiles and all related material.If the Iraqi regime wishes peace  it willimmediately end all support for terrorism and act tosuppress it  as all States are required to do by SecurityCouncil resolutions.If the Iraqi regime wishes peace  it will ceasepersecution of its civilian population  including Shia Sunnis  Kurds  Turkomans and others — again  asrequired by Security Council resolutions.If the Iraqi regime wishes peace  it will release oraccount for all Gulf war personnel whose fate is stillunknown. It will return the remains of any who aredeceased  return stolen property  accept liability forlosses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait and fullycooperate with international efforts to resolve thoseissues  as required by Security Council resolutions.If the Iraqi regime wishes peace  it willimmediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-foodprogramme. It will accept United Nationsadministration of funds from that programme  to ensurethat the money is used fairly and promptly for thebenefit of the Iraqi people.If all those steps are taken  it will signal a newopenness and accountability in Iraq. And it could openthe prospect of the United Nations helping to build aGovernment that represents all Iraqis — a Governmentbased on respect for human rights  economic libertyand internationally supervised elections.The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqipeople. They have suffered too long in silent captivity.Liberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and agreat strategic goal. The people of Iraq deserve it. Thesecurity of all nations requires it.Free societies do not intimidate through crueltyand conquest  and open societies do not threaten theworld with mass murder. The United States supportspolitical and economic liberty in a unified Iraq.9We can harbour no illusions  and that is importanttoday to remember. Saddam Hussein attacked Iran in1980 and Kuwait in 1990. He has fired ballisticmissiles at Iran and Saudi Arabia  Bahrain and Israel.His regime once ordered the killing of every personbetween the ages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdishvillages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many Iraniansand 40 Iraqi villages.My nation will work with the Security Council tomeet our common challenge. If Iraq's regime defies usagain  the world must move deliberately and decisivelyto hold Iraq to account. We will work with the SecurityCouncil for the necessary resolutions. But the purposesof the United States should not be doubted. TheSecurity Council resolutions will be enforced  and thejust demands of peace and security will be met  oraction will be unavoidable  and a regime that has lostits legitimacy will also lose its power.Events can turn in one of two ways.If we fail to act in the face of danger  the peopleof Iraq will continue to live in brutal submission. Theregime will have new power to bully  dominate andconquer its neighbours  condemning the Middle East tomore years of bloodshed and fear. The region willremain unstable  with little hope of freedom  andisolated from the progress of our times. With every stepthe Iraqi regime takes towards gaining and deployingthe most terrible weapons  our own options to confrontthat regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regimewere to supply these weapons to terrorist allies  thenthe attacks of 11 September would be a prelude to fargreater horrors.If we meet our responsibilities  if we overcomethis danger  we can arrive at a very different future.The people of Iraq can shake off their captivity. Theycan one day join a democratic Afghanistan and ademocratic Palestine  inspiring reforms throughout theMuslim world. These nations can show by theirexample that honest government  respect for women and the great Islamic tradition of learning can triumphin the Middle East and beyond. We will show that thepromise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in ourtime.Neither of these outcomes is certain. Both havebeen set before us. We must choose between a world offear and a world of progress. We cannot stand by anddo nothing while dangers gather. We must stand up forour security and for the permanent rights and hopes ofmankind. By heritage and by choice  the United Statesof America will make that stand. Representatives to theUnited Nations have the power to make that stand aswell."
"178",7276,"UZB",57,2002,"﻿Atthe outset  allow me to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan onhis election as President for the current session of theGeneral Assembly. I would also like to expressappreciation to Mr. Han Seung-soo for his excellentorganization of the work of the previous session of theGeneral Assembly.A year ago the world confronted acts of terror unprecedented in scale and barbarity. We all rememberthe 11 September 2001 events in the United States andmourn the lives lost.The events of last autumn  first of all  show thatsecurity threats are taking on new and dangerousforms. The phenomenon of terrorism has become morecomplex. At the current stage the world has to contendwith organized international terrorism.The United Nations devotes much attention to thefight against international terrorism. We welcome theUnited Nations Security Council resolution 1373(2001)  which stipulates the establishment of theCounter-Terrorism Committee to coordinate andincrease the efficiency of the internationalcommunity's efforts to fight this most dangerous threatof the twenty-first century.I would like to recall in this regard thatUzbekistan strongly urged establishment of such acommittee within the United Nations as early as 1999.Uzbekistan is one of the few countries that areparties to all twelve conventions on combatingterrorism. We sincerely hope that the appeal bySecretary-General Kofi Annan to the United NationsMember States to join and ratify these documents willbe followed and put into practice.Uzbekistan supports the international counter-terrorism coalition as a matter of principle and standsready to make its contribution to enhance global andregional stability.17The events of 11 September made the world faceup to the situation in Afghanistan and  one can say opened the eyes of the international community to thefact that terrorism has no borders and only throughjoint efforts we can defeat this perilous challenge tohumanity. In a strict and  I would say  categorical waythe events of 11 September reminded everybody thattwenty years of war turned Afghanistan into a breedingground and hotbed of international terrorism thatthreatened not only neighbouring countries and nations but all of humanity.We are gratified today by the positivedevelopments in that country; we welcome theconvening of the Loya Jirga  and the transitionalGovernment led by President Hâmid Karzai.At the same time  despite the successfulcompletion of the military phase of the counter-terrorist operation in Afghanistan  today there can beno room for complacency.First  huge amounts of weapons accumulatedduring the long years of war in Afghanistan still remainin the possession of armed groups there. In this contextthere can be no justification for the attempts of certainStates to supply ever more weapons to this long-suffering land.To ensure stability and prevent militaryconfrontation it is important to resolve the problemsrelated to the reduction and collection of the hugeamounts of weapons accumulated in Afghanistan.Clearing the Afghan territory of weapons arsenalsbelonging to criminal groups will also reinforce theactivities of the United Nations and regionalinstitutions to thwart the illicit arms trade.Secondly  the post-war dislocation  economicdisaster  as well as the lack of resources to rebuildAfghanistan  may become a catalyst for social unrestthat could be used by certain armed groups inside andbeyond Afghanistan to create a new round of militaryconfrontation.Thirdly  there are still various groups in theterritory of Afghanistan  including remnants of theTaliban  that are capable of conducting subversiveactions and guerrilla warfare. Confrontation continuesamong various warlord-leaders of different ethnicgroups.Fourthly  the situation on drug trafficking remainsalmost unchanged. Afghanistan is still the world's mainsupplier of opium and heroin. According to manyinternational experts  the removal of the Taliban regimedoes not yet mean the elimination of the criminalnarcotics business in Afghanistan. Today the wholeworld is seriously concerned about this problem. Thereis an urgent need for adequate measures and assistanceon the part of the entire international community  aswell as the active support of the Afghan authorities tocombat narco-aggression.The number of drug addicts in the world runs intothe hundreds of millions of people. Proliferation ofdrug addiction undermines both the health of livinggenerations and the gene pool of nations. This affectspeople in both the developed and developing countries.The Republic of Uzbekistan  making great efforts tofight drug production  abuse and trafficking  fullysupports the measures undertaken by the UnitedNations and the international community to confrontthese threats.I would like to underline that it is much easierand more effective to fight drug trafficking at thesource. Therefore  we have to block the huge flow ofthe Afghan drugs right at the borders of the CentralAsian States  rather than hunt for grammes andkilogrammes in Europe and other developed countries.In this regard  it is advisable to shift fromnumerous counter-narcotics programmes of smallefficiency to the concrete solution of this acuteproblem by allocating the United Nations-controlledresources and means to nip the narcotics trafficking atthe source.Today the attention of the entire internationalcommunity is riveted on the issue of Iraq. In this regardwe support the statement of United States PresidentGeorge Bush delivered in the United Nations from thisvery rostrum.The measures towards resolution of the currentsituation proposed by the President of the United Statesdeserve thorough consideration and may be taken as abasis for the elaboration of the position to be taken bythe United Nations Security Council.Uzbekistan attaches great significance to thestrengthening of the global process of non-proliferationof weapons of mass destruction. Our country hasalready received credit for its activity in this field. Thestrategy of Uzbekistan in ensuring security is based onthe country's participation in the United Nations-led18processes of disarmament and arms control andreduction.Uzbekistan fully supports the principle ofindivisibility of security and in this context  as aninitiator of the nuclear-weapon-free zone in CentralAsia  acknowledges responsibility for strengthening thenuclear non-proliferation regime and takes active partin the elaboration process of international instrumentsin this field.Uzbekistan proposes to sign the practicallyfinalized and agreed draft of the document on thenuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia inKazakhstan in the city of Semipalatinsk  the former sitefor hundreds of nuclear tests  in the presence of UnitedNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan during hisupcoming visit to the Central Asian region.The Republic of Uzbekistan supports proposalsmade by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the UnitedNations reforms. This is necessary for an appropriateadaptation of this Organisation to the dynamic changesin the international arena. Uzbekistan is one of thoseStates that considers the United Nations SecurityCouncil reforms to be part of the evolution of the entireUnited Nations system.The current structure of the Security Councilreflects the realities of a past era. The world haschanged since then. We believe that Japan andGermany have a legitimate right to permanentmembership in the Security Council. All necessarygrounds for this are present.In conclusion  I would like to recall that it hasbeen ten years since Uzbekistan became a UnitedNations Member  and it is very gratifying to see theUnited Nations family expanding. We congratulateSwitzerland and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on their decision to become fully-fledged partiesto the multilateral cooperation and dialogue of theUnited Nations. It should mean that the idea of peaceand noble principles of the global security system arethe order of the day."
"179",7323,"VCT",57,2002,"﻿On behalf of the Government and the people of SaintVincent and the Grenadines  I am pleased to offer ourmost heartfelt congratulations to President Jan Kavanon his assumption of the office of President of thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Let mealso express our appreciation and thanks to theoutgoing President  Mr. Han Seung-soo  for theexcellent manner in which he conducted the affairs ofthe fifty-sixth session as President.I should also like to take this opportunity towelcome our newest member — the SwissConfederation — into the United Nations  and we lookforward to the admission of East Timor to the family ofnations before the end of this month.Let me first of all pay my respects to thisOrganization  the United Nations  and to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. Since the onslaught of theterrorist attacks in September last year  the world hasbeen focused once again on the unique role of theUnited Nations as never before  as the nations cametogether to fight the scourge of terrorism. Just lastweek  President Bush used his address to this forum toinvoke the special and unique assistance of the UnitedNations to deal with the problems related to Iraq. Theworld breathed a sigh of relief when it heard thewelcome decision by Iraq to readmit the UnitedNations weapons inspectors  without conditions  intoIraq. We hope that this decision will be efficacious inresolving this problem  which could have unforeseenconsequences for the whole world. In general  wesupport the collective judgement of the United Nationsrather than any rash unilateral action by any one or twoMember States.We have also witnessed the tangible results of thesupport of the United Nations for East Timor in itsstruggle for independence and for Afghanistan in itsstruggle for liberation  peace and stability.I say without hesitation or equivocation thattoday the world needs the United Nations more thanever before.Holding the attention of all of us at this time areongoing activities associated with the war on terrorism.We were all engaged in a solemn commemoration ofthe sickening events of 11 September just last week  onthe occasion of the first anniversary of the brutalterrorist attacks on the United States of America.We — the whole world — must commit ourselves toensuring that such events will never happen again. Weapplaud the work done by the Counter-TerrorismCommittee established by the United Nations to securecompliance with Security Council resolution 1373(2001).Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has alreadycontributed to this effort by implementing a range ofmeasures to combat terrorism and assist the globaleffort. We recognize the links between terrorism andinternational criminal activities such as drugtrafficking  money-laundering and organized crime. Wepledge to do whatever is in our power to combat thesethreats.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  like many ofthe poorer nations of the world  is crippled by externaldebt. The burden of this debt means that areas ofcritical importance to our development  such aseducation  poverty reduction and social development are deprived of the resources that are desperatelyneeded for the advancement of our people.The pursuit of sustainable development remainscentral to the efforts of our people to create a better lifefor themselves. To this end  my country had greatexpectations from the International Conference onFinancing for Development  held in Monterrey Mexico  and also from the just-concluded WorldSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg South Africa. While these conferences enabled someattention to be focused on the urgency of thedevelopment agenda that must be addressed  and somelevel of consensus was achieved with respect to theaction required  we must lament the reluctance of somedeveloped countries to give more meaningfulexpression to their stated commitments.Mere recognition and articulation of the problemswill not suffice. Actions  not words  are needed tochange the situation. This requires the will and therequisite resources to effect the changes required. Wetherefore call on those members of the internationalcommunity to give reality to their words by putting inplace the necessary arrangements and the financingthrough which we all can manage the critical problemsof sustainable development. Let us remind theinternational community of its commitment to meeting5the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of grossdomestic product for official development assistance.My country  like others in the Caribbean and inAfrica  is threatened by the scourge of HIV/AIDS. As amatter of fact  my country has the second-highest percapita ratio of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean Community(CARICOM). We are in danger of losing a wholegeneration of our young people to this dreaded disease.We lack the resources to procure the necessarytreatment and proper care for those affected. We mustall work together — developed and developingcountries — to eradicate this and other diseases such asmalaria and tuberculosis. We must make sure that theGlobal Fund to fight these diseases has the necessaryresources to do its work effectively.Six years after the completion of the UruguayRound of trade negotiations and the creation of theWorld Trade Organization (WTO)  my country has hadto endure the ravages of the imbalances of economicpower in the world. The constraints imposed by oursmall size and vulnerability must now be evident to all.As we deploy our limited human resources to engage innegotiations at three distinct and separate levels — theWTO  the European Union and the Free Trade Area ofthe Americas — we urge that due recognition be givento the need for flexibility in trading arrangements forcountries such as mine. We would also like to see arealistic assessment of special and differentialtreatment in the continued architecture of the globaltrading and economic arrangements. Our ability tosurvive is effectively compromised if there is noflexibility in these negotiations.We welcome the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment. We commend the African countries thatcame together to create this bold and imaginative newinitiative. Africa needs the help of the United Nationsand in particular that of the donor countries. But Africaalso needs to help itself by committing itself to peace democracy and good governance  which requires theeradication of corruption in public life. We welcomethe efforts being made to end strife and war and tocreate a climate of stability and peace in Angola  SierraLeone  the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of theCongo.As we view the international scene  we aretroubled by the widespread and corrosive nature ofcorruption in public life in many countries. The effectsin the developing countries are more debilitating.Corruption distorts the economies of those countries since  in effect  resources are taken from the poor andgiven to the rich. My country  as part of its war againstcorruption in public life  has recently ratified theOrganization of American States (OAS) Conventionagainst Corruption  which requires  among otherthings  the criminalizing of illicit enrichment by publicofficials and integrity legislation requiring adeclaration of assets by certain public officials. Ihumbly suggest that the United Nations recognize thepervasiveness of corruption in public life and itsconsequent damages and take steps to approve andpromote a United Nations anti-corruption convention.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has a very specialand beneficial relationship with the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan  which we value. It represents a test offriendship  loyalty  reciprocity and shared values in ourrelationship. The Republic of China on Taiwan  the17th largest economy in the world  is a country of 23million people that has made tremendous strides withina few years to become one of the most economicallyadvanced countries in the Far East. It is a country thatpractices and promotes human rights. It has aGovernment that is democratically elected by the freeand unfettered expression of its citizens.We strongly support Taiwan's rights to be aMember of this body of nations. We cannot understandhow the exclusion of Taiwan  which is a peace-loving responsible  democratic and progressive country  cansit comfortably on the collective conscience of theMember States of the United Nations. The UnitedNations has a role to play in relations between Taiwanand the People's Republic of China. The UnitedNations should play a facilitating role by providing aforum for reconciliation and rapprochement betweenthe two sides. But — and I cannot stress this point toostrongly — the United Nations cannot play such a roleif it continues to exclude Taiwan. We shall continue tosupport the legitimate aspirations of the 23 millionpeople of Taiwan  who remain voiceless in thisAssembly  to membership in this body and its agencies in accordance with the United Nations principle ofuniversality.The Government and people of Saint Vincent andthe Grenadines also share friendship with the peopleand Government of Cuba. We support the worldwidecall  as expressed in United Nations resolutions  forending the economic  commercial and financialembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba6some 42 years ago. Indeed  such a call has been madeby the Congress of the United States so as to facilitatethe freedom of movement of United States citizens toCuba.We uphold the right of peoples to self-determination — a principle very dear to our peopleand Government. It is highly improper andunacceptable to the vast majority of the nations of theworld that one country impose such suffering onanother without any justifiable reason. We call on theUnited States to heed the voices of its citizens  theCongress and the rest of the world and to engage Cubain a meaningful dialogue for the mutual benefit of bothcountries.Over the past year  we have watched withgrowing concern the escalation of tension and violencein the Middle East. We are sensitive to the fact thatefforts against international terrorism have made thelessening of tensions and the resolution of the problemsin the Middle East all the more difficult. We supportthe plan for two States — Israel and Palestine — livingas neighbours within secure borders that are recognizedby each other and the international community. Onceagain  we call on both sides to abide by the variousSecurity Council resolutions on the dispute. We supportthe efforts of the Quartet and call upon them tocontinue their peace-making efforts with urgency. Theyhave our unqualified backing. In the meantime  weurge restraint and the use of common sense in thesearch for a full solution to the problem. We remind allsides that the greatest use of power is restraint in theuse of that power. We urge the world community tomake sure that all resolutions of the United Nations areenforced fairly  even-handedly and with equity on allStates in conflict in the area and to avoid theappearance of selective  capricious or arbitraryenforcements where it suits the interests of someStates.In South Asia  we trust that there will be a de-escalation of tensions in the Kashmiri conflict. Therisks and the perils would be too great for the wholeworld if the two major countries involved in thatconflict engage in an all-out war  resorting to nuclearweapons.We place our support behind every effort torevitalize the work of the General Assembly so that itscollective energy and wisdom can again be brought tobear with great weight to resolve the gravest tensionsimpacting the world community. The GeneralAssembly needs to be more dynamic in order to reflectthe will of all its Member States. We also support theneed for a reform of the Security Council to givecognizance to the world situation as it exists today andnot as was the norm after the Second World War. Wefully support the call for an increase in the membershipof the Security Council and would work for the moremeaningful participation of developing countries in theSecurity Council to reflect the universal nature of theUnited Nations.My country is a small island developing State. Assuch  we are extremely vulnerable to physical andeconomic shocks. We are pleased with the recognitiongiven to the unique problems of small islanddeveloping States in the outcome of the World Summiton Sustainable Development  and we look forward toreal progress in the implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action  leading up to the conference inMauritius in 2004. We continue to face the threat to ourregion and our oceans by the passage of hazardousnuclear waste through our waters. The worldcommunity must understand just how fragile ourecosystems are. We must reduce the risk by ending thatpractice  and thus we call on the guilty parties torespect the Caribbean Sea as a special zone foreconomic development within the context ofsustainable development.I have taken this opportunity to focus our effortstowards increasing sensitivity in the internationalcommunity to the concerns of our small islanddeveloping State. Our perspective is informed by ourhistory and our experiences. Many are the challengesthat confront us in a world of globalization and tradeliberalization. We make our special plea for specialconsideration  without which we could become totallymarginalized. The aspirations of our people are thesame as those of other lands. We desire peace  stability democracy  respect for human lives and economic andsocial uplifting. We intend to work hard to achievethose goals. Our people have come through slavery indentureship  colonialism and imperialism  and wehave survived. With the support and goodwill of thedonor countries  with our hard work and with the helpof the Almighty  we intend to succeed."
"180",7370,"VEN",57,2002,"﻿Theheroic people of Venezuela and its revolutionaryGovernment greet all peoples and all Governments ofthe world represented in the General Assembly of theUnited Nations.I must begin by underlining the intense activitythat Venezuela has undertaken within the framework ofthe agenda of the United Nations this year of 2002. Forthat reason  we made the effort to come here to thismost timely session of the General Assembly.Venezuela began the year by assuming in Januarythe presidency of the Group of 77 and China. Wecoordinated and managed that very important group ofcountries of the world  primarily the countries of thethird world. First  we coordinated the preparations documents  agreements and dialogues leading up to theMonterrey Summit  where we attended  speaking onbehalf of the countries of the South and especially onbehalf of the countries of the Group of 77 and China.Venezuela then continued that effort by coordinatingour Group in preparation for the importantJohannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development held a few days ago. The discussions at theJohannesburg Summit are still fresh in our minds.This year  the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuelaalso held the presidency of the Group of 15  anotherimportant group of developing countries fighting forgreater scope in the political  economic and socialdomains.Finally  Venezuela has had a very intense agendaat the United Nations during this year of 2002  and inthe remaining months we wish to finish the year withan even greater intensity  making proposals coordinating actions and seeking decisions to completeand contribute our modest effort in the search for thesolutions  goals and objectives set out in this Hallduring the historic Millennium Summit of 2000.Thus we come once again to this Hall to ensurethat the world hears the voice of millions of men women and children who fight daily for their life anddignity by striving towards justice in the homeland ofSimÛn Bolvar.To begin  I would say that this session of theGeneral Assembly is meeting amidst the suffering and2mourning afflicting the people of the United States  thepeople and city of New York and all peoples of theworld  on this first anniversary of the heinous acts of11 September. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela from the soul of its heroic people and from the heart ofits revolutionary and democratic Government  prays toGod our Lord for the eternal peace of the victims ofthose horrible events. It also reiterates its sentiments ofsolidarity and condolences to their families. It affirmsits condemnation of those who planned and carried outthose terrorist actions. We also offer our efforts in thefight against the scourge of terrorism in the world in itsmost diverse facets and manifestations. However  at thesame time  Venezuela stresses the necessity ofrecognizing the complexity of the alarming situation inthe world today. The direct condemnation of terrorismmust necessarily be accompanied  for ethical andmoral reasons  by an equally forceful condemnationof the causes and processes that have transformed theworld into an infinite sum of marginalized individualsand a reign of injustice  inequality and poverty. It iswritten in the Bible  which contains God's words  thatthe only path to peace is justice.The resolute repudiation of terrorism must also beaccompanied by an unreserved political resolve on thepart of the leaders of the world to acknowledge  forexample  that today's international economic systemfuels a process in which the perverse doctrine ofunbridled neoliberalism leads to greater poverty inequality and despair among the poor peoples of ourearth.For example  17 people die of hunger everyminute in the world. If we were to fulfil all thecommitments undertaken to combat poverty  it wouldtake us 130 years to eradicate it from the planet according to figures cited in the most recent report ofthe United Nations Development Programme.The condemnation of terrorism must go hand inhand with a decision-making process that will make itpossible to make greater headway in the war  thewar  I stress  against poverty. For that reason Venezuela has consistently advocated  first atMonterrey and then  more recently  at Johannesburg that an international humanitarian fund should becreated whose resources might come  for example from a percentage of global military expenditure. Itcould be funded by a percentage of the immenseresources  those billions and billions of dollars  thatwe  the developing countries  the poor countries annually transfer to the developed world through theperverse mechanism of external debt  or eternal debt I should say.I am sure that the countries of Africa and Asiacan tell the same story as we in Latin America do. Inthe last 20 years of the twentieth century  LatinAmerica paid off more than twice the amount of itsexternal debt. But now it turns out that we owe morethan when we began this whole perverse process.It seems only fair to me that  given the situationthat faces the world and the bleak path that we arefollowing  this issue must be debated. Why not transfera portion of this eternal debt' to an internationalhumanitarian fund  a fund that could also befinanced by monies confiscated from drug traffickers who do so much harm in the world  and from corruptindividuals who have walked off with billions ofdollars from poor countries.Venezuela has a list that it will provide to thepolice forces of the world. It will assist them in gettingback billions of dollars and in transferring them to aninternational fund. Such a fund could also be financedthrough a tax that could be levied  quite justly  onmajor speculative capital transactions. There could beother possible sources as well; of course  this wouldrequire a very high-level political decision at the globallevel.Today  faced with the world's tragedy  Venezuelainsists on this idea  and we ask the United Nations toengage in a debate on this issue. In Johannesburg  forexample  I recall that we began very interestingdiscussions in a number of round table meetings inwhich Venezuela participated. We discussed this topic and I was very gratified to see a consensus emergeamong the heads of State and Government presentthere. I was very pleased with the support expressed forthat idea by the President of brotherly Brazil  FernandoHenrique Cardoso  who  during the Johannesburground tables  commented on the need to createinstruments such as this  given that today'sinternational financial agencies are not adequatelyequipped to combat poverty  a scourge that besets allof humankind.President Cardoso referred to the Marshall Plan which was put into effect to assist Europe in the post-war period. I think that today we would need hundredsof Marshall Plans around the world to save thecountries of the third word from hell and from death.3But just as we condemn global terrorism and itscauses  I have come to the Assembly also on behalf ofthe valiant people of the Bolivarian Republic todenounce out loud other kinds of terrorism and otherkinds of causes. In Venezuela  we have seen thebeginning of a process of planned  systematicterrorism  which erupted in violence and blood also onthe eleventh  11 April  not 11 September  this year that is  five months ago. On that day  a fascist putschoverthrew the legitimate Government that I amprivileged to head  and installed  for an extremely briefperiod  a dictatorship that filled with fear the streets cities and villages of our beloved Venezuela.What were the causes of that bloody terroristcoup d'état  which resulted in the loss of dozens ofhuman lives and wounded hundreds of people  who arestill recovering from their very serious injuries? Quitesimply  what we had was a democratic Government a legitimate Government elected by the people; aGovernment that has committed itself to revolutionarydemocracy and to political  economic and socialchange; a Government that has very resolutely and veryseriously undertaken to put into effect the principles ofthe United Nations; a Government that has undertakenthe task of carrying out social actions that willtransform society in order to bring justice and equalityto our people; a Government that has doubled thebudget for education in less than three years; aGovernment that has doubled the health-care budget; aGovernment that has reduced by 10 per cent infantmalnutrition; a Government that has increased by 10per cent its people's access to drinking water; aGovernment that has reduced infant mortality from 21per 1 000 to 17 per 1 000; a Government that hasincreased by 30 per cent children and adolescents'access to free and compulsory public education. This isa Government that has had to deal with the wildneoliberal privatization of health and education  aGovernment that began by reducing poverty andmarginalization in a country that is full of wealth buthas been governed by senseless elitists who werecompletely insensitive to people's needs. AGovernment such as this was overthrown by a fascistalliance among privileged sectors  factions instigating acoup d'état using media terror.There is an issue in today's world that needs to bediscussed in the world but few dare to do so; I wouldlike to be bold enough to discuss it. This issue is theuse of mass media in the world. Venezuela is a goodcase to be studied. Mass media  exploiting the freedomof expression and the freedom of the press  supportedthe putsch and manipulated society. The most appallingthing was that  when the people reacted against thedictatorship  the popular reaction was silenced andbroadcasting was stopped and nobody knew what washappening in Venezuela. I think this is a special case ofethics in media communications that deserves to bestudied.A little while ago  a great intellectual and LatinAmerican writer  the Uruguayan Eduardo Galeano author of Open Veins of Latin America spoke of thequestion of mass media around the world and said thisgreat truth: Never have so few deceived so many.' Weneed to tackle this with courage as we face thebeginning of this century. The elitist perpetrators of theputsch used the mass media and think they cancontinue to use them. They used police terrorism andmilitary terrorism and achieved a very powerfulalliance that was successful in overthrowing theGovernment and succeeded in taking me prisoner andkeeping me incommunicado for many hours on aCaribbean island. This fascist coup eliminated theCongress  overthrew all laws and all public branches ofauthority and did away with the judicial branch. Itseized mayors and members of Parliament elected bythe population. However  in spite of all of this  theycould not oppress us. Within a few hours  somethinghappened in Venezuela that has scarcely ever happenedin any country or nation. People began to rush out intothe streets  without weapons  with only the weapons oftheir courage and their hearts and with the BolivarianConstitution in their hands. Millions of men andwomen and young people went out into the streets clamouring for respect for their dignity and  miracleof miracles  in less than forty-eight hours  theGovernment along with patriotic soldiers overthrew thedictatorship  restored the Constitution  rescued thePresident who had been abducted and restoreddemocracy to Venezuela. This was a miracle. Only apeople that is united can achieve this. Only a peoplethat is conscious and active can sweep away suchfascist and terrorist assaults. This was the first timethat this was ever seen in any nation for a very longtime.Mine is a people that has regained its libertarianessence and its liberating essence. A people that  sincethe time of SimÛn Bolvar hardly two hundred yearsago  has worked together with Colombia  Ecuador 4Peru  Bolivia  Panama to achieve the independence ofhalf of the continent of the Americas. This is theVenezuelan people for whom I  once again  reaffirmmy undying love and devotion for their courage anddignity.And here  from this rostrum  on behalf of thispeople  I offer my sincere and warm thanks for all thegestures of solidarity that we received from here  fromthe United Nations  from the Organization of AmericanStates  from Governments and above all  from manycountries of the Americas. Messages came also fromAsia  Europe  Africa and Oceania  because this was aunique situation at the beginning of this century. Thisconstitution is a revolutionary peaceloving anddemocratic document. It was drafted by the peopleitself and is now being defended and promoted by thepeople.In conclusion  following these events we inVenezuela are aware  we know  I realize that manypeople do not yet know  we have experiencedterrorism first hand.A few days ago a video came out  more proof ofwhat was being planned in Venezuela. In that video aninternational journalist made some revelations  statingthat he was called in the morning on the day of thecoup and that  long before the first person fell dead as aresult of shooting by a number of snipers  there weresome foreigners among them  the coup perpetratorswere already recording a message in which they saidthat President Ch·vez had ordered people to be killedand that there had been six deaths. Well before thefiring and the massacre of defenceless people began they had already recorded this message.Ultimately  fortunately  the military and civilianreaction was very rapid  because the terror that hadbeen planned against the Venezuelan people on amassive scale would have meant that terrorist practiceswould be applied against anything that was popular ordemocratic in Venezuela. They expected to repeal theConstitution. But  of course  it was restored withinforty-eight hours because of the peaceful democraticrevolution brought about by the people.We are grateful for the international community'sunequivocal condemnation of the coup d'état  thenightmare  that we experienced for some days inVenezuela. And we reaffirm that our Government  inwhich Venezuelans have placed their confidence in anumber of successive democratic processes  will notengage in a witch hunt  or carrying out summary trialsor executions. As the people say  there is a song theysing in the streets: He's back  he's back  he's back.'With strict adherence to our humanitarian andBolivarian tradition and upholding our nationalConstitution  we came back with our Constitution inour hands on the popular tide that swept the legitimateGovernment back  along with the Constitution  and putan end to the terrorists  the coup d'état and itsperpetrators. For the first time in Venezuela's history victory in a political conflict  and bear in mind thatthis was the overthrow of a dictatorship  meant thatthe Government that returned respected those who hadbeen defeated.We have now engaged in a major nationaldialogue  a national debate. In this we have alsorequested the help of the United Nations through theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) andasked for support from representatives of theOrganization of American States. We have alsorequested support from the Carter Center headed byformer President Jimmy Carter.We are grateful for their support and we reaffirmthat Venezuela will continue to be guided by God andby the hand of its people  with the BolivarianConstitution in its grasp. In doing so we will be joiningthe world to contribute to seek out alternatives to theeconomic models that have unleashed hunger andmisery upon the world. We will continue to make ourmodest contribution  backed by the efforts of millions.We will continue to make a supreme effort to changethe world and to make it viable so that  as soon aspossible in the twenty-first century  justice will beachieved. For  as the word of God has asserted forthousands of years  justice is absolutely the only pathto genuine peace."
"181",7409,"VNM",57,2002,"﻿Mr. President I wish  at the outset  to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan onhis election to the presidency of the fifty-seventhsession of the United Nations General Assembly. Iwould like also to express my high appreciation to hispredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo of theRepublic of Korea for having efficiently presided overthe deliberations of the fifty-sixth session. Viet Namjoins others in welcoming the Democratic Republic ofTimor-Leste and the Confederation of Switzerland toour family of nations.We come to this session with the remembrance ofthe tragic incident of 11 September  when thousands ofinnocent lives were lost in the towering inferno causedby terrorists. Our world has changed a lot since thatday  as Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in hisstatement before this body last week  to the effect thatthe terrorist attacks of 11 September were not anisolated event  that they were an extreme example of aglobal scourge  one which required a broad  sustainedand global response.By adopting Security Council resolution 1373(2001) and General Assembly resolution 56/1  byenacting and carrying out various measures in differentfields  at national as well as regional levels  thecommunity of world countries has sent out a very clearand resolute message: we condemn in the mostcategorical terms terrorism under whatever formsagainst innocent people  and we will take action underthe Charter of the United Nations  because that must bethe way for our fight to be sustained.Fighting terrorism does not simply mean bringingto justice the perpetrators and conspirators  but alsotackling the poverty  injustice  subjugation and illegaloccupation that underlie it. That is to say  whilefighting against terrorism remains high on our agenda other issues  notably the resolution of regional conflictsand the implementation of important developmentgoals set out in the Millennium Declaration  such asalleviating poverty  narrowing the gap between the richand the poor and development gaps within and amongnations  fighting against HIV/AIDS  drugs  organizedtransnational crime  protecting the environment — allthese should not be downgraded or become any lessurgent.Over the past year  besides efforts againstterrorism  the United Nations took the lead inorganizing a series of important internationalconferences  most notably the Monterrey InternationalConference on Financing for Development  the SpecialSession of the General Assembly on Children  theWorld Summit on Food Security and the JohannesburgWorld Summit on Sustainable Development  whereconcrete measures were adopted in the interests of eachand every nation. The United Nations also continued itsimportant work on conflict prevention  peace-buildingin various parts of the world  including its preparationsfor East Timor's independence  and conflict resolutionin Africa and elsewhere. Mention should be made of itsefforts relating to the Peace Agreement between theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. TheUnited Nations and the Secretary-General should becommended for these significant endeavours.Even with those achievements  however  theUnited Nations is expected to do more. TheOrganization must enhance its efforts to help resolveprotracted conflicts  especially those in the MiddleEast  by peaceful means and free from intervention andimposition. In this vein  we reiterate our full supportfor the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people toexercise their inalienable rights to self-determinationand to live in an independent and sovereign State.We welcome the dialogue between theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and theRepublic of Korea and the resumption of talks betweenthe former and the United States  and we sincerelyhope that they will lead to fruitful conclusions. Weagain join other speakers in voicing our concern overthe issue of Iraq  and in welcoming all efforts to defusethe tension. The acceptance by Iraq of the return ofUnited Nations weapons inspectors without conditionsgives us some hope that a military attack will beavoided.In a world of interdependence  we consider iteven more important to uphold the principle of respectfor the sovereignty  territorial integrity and politicalindependence of States. In this regard  an early endmust be put to the blockades and embargoes that fordecades have been causing immeasurable suffering tothe peoples of Cuba  Iraq  Libya and elsewhere.As arms races re-escalate in many parts of theworld  the Conference on Disarmament  for fourconsecutive years  has not been able to start itssubstantive work; we must find a way to break thedeadlock.20Effective measures to limit and mitigate thenegative impact of globalization on developingcountries need to be formulated and implemented toensure equal development opportunities for all nations.International commitments to raising and maintainingofficial development assistance at the level of 0.7 percent of gross domestic product  to building an open equitable multilateral trading system  to removingprotectionism with a view to facilitating access ofgoods from developing countries into developedmarkets  to debt relief  and to implementing numerousprinciples to protect the global environment includingthe principle of common but differentiatedresponsibilities  and so on  must be strengthened andput into action. To accomplish these goals  the UnitedNations and its affiliated agencies and organizations especially the financial institutions need to strengthenthemselves through the ongoing reform process.Viet Nam continues to hold the view that thisprocess should primarily focus on enhancing the role ofthe General Assembly and on making the SecurityCouncil more democratic  representative  transparentand accountable through the expansion of itsmembership in both the non-permanent and thepermanent categories. In that connection  we wish toreaffirm our support for those candidates  such asIndia  Japan and Germany  that have the capability tomake major contributions to the work of that importantbody.In South-East Asia  the countries of theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) aredetermined to strengthen their unity and cooperation inorder to respond to the challenges arising within andoutside the region. The implementation of the HanoiPlan of Action  the Initiative for ASEAN Integrationand the Hanoi Declaration on narrowing thedevelopment gap for closer ASEAN integration hasachieved initial encouraging results.ASEAN has continued to further deepen itsrelationship with its dialogue partners as well as otherinternational institutions and organizations  with a viewto contributing further to peace  stability anddevelopment. Apart from their strong commitment andenormous efforts devoted to the fight against terrorism including the recent signing of the ASEAN-US JointDeclaration for Cooperation to Combat InternationalTerrorism  the ASEAN countries are working closelywith China for the early adoption of a declaration onthe conduct of parties in the South China Sea. This isanother positive development towards building a codeof conduct in the South China Sea  as agreed byASEAN leaders at the Sixth ASEAN Summit  held inHanoi in December 1998  thereby contributing to thepromotion of confidence-building and the resolution ofall disputes by peaceful means.Consistent with its foreign policy ofindependence  sovereignty  openness multilateralization and the diversification of itsexternal relations as well as its desire to be a friend andreliable partner of all countries striving forindependence  peace and cooperation  Viet Nam hascontinued to develop and strengthen its friendships andmultifaceted cooperation with countries in and outsidethe region  and with international organizations.Viet Nam is expediting all necessary procedures to jointhe World Trade Organization soon.The free and democratic general elections held inMay 2002 and the successful conclusion of the firstsession of the new National Assembly  with highlyqualified representatives elected to important State National Assembly and Government positions for the2002-2007 term  constitute important events in thepolitical life of our nation and create a firm foundationfor us to continue the renewal process aimed atbuilding Viet Nam into a strong country with aprosperous people and a just  democratic and civilizedsociety. In striving for those goals  we hope to continueto enjoy the support and cooperation of all countriesand organizations. For its part  Vietnam pledges to doits utmost to contribute to the work of the UnitedNations."
"182",7440,"VUT",57,2002,"﻿In addressing thishonourable Assembly  I first wish to convey thegreetings of the people of the Republic of Vanuatu. Ourfuture will be determined by the nations representedhere today.I also take this opportunity to congratulate you Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. You haveassumed the presidency during a turbulent period ininternational relations  and my delegation pledges itsfull support and cooperation to you  as you guide thisnoble Organization through this difficult time. I alsotake this opportunity to acknowledge with deepgratitude the contributions of your predecessor  who socompetently steered the work of the fifty-sixth sessionof the General Assembly to its conclusion.I acknowledge with much gratitude andadmiration the outstanding leadership and diplomaticskills of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Hisoutstanding wisdom has made it possible for the UnitedNations to maintain its credibility and relevance notonly in maintaining international peace throughout theworld  but also in ensuring that this Organizationcontinues to address the development challengesconfronting the world  including Vanuatu.I am pleased to welcome the Swiss Confederationas a Member of the United Nations. I am lookingforward to the imminent admission of the DemocraticRepublic of Timor-Leste  a nation where Vanuatu washonoured to have participated in the United Nations-administered peacekeeping process.The deeply disturbing events of 11 Septemberwill remain etched in our memories for a long time. Onbehalf of the Government and people of Vanuatu I have the solemn duty of conveying to theGovernment and people of the United States ofAmerica  including the families of the innocent victimsof 11 September 2001  our sincere condolences for themany innocent lives lost on that fatal day of the mostinhuman act of modern history. The barbaric andcowardly acts of 11 September have shaken thefoundations and principles on which this Organizationis built. They have ushered in a new period of globaluncertainty.Terrorism has become the scourge of our time.This complex phenomenon has scarred our planet. Asresponsible members of the international community we must work closely together in order to eradicate it.However  any action of reprisal or punitive measuresmust receive universal support through establishedmultilateral and international structures  beginningwith the United Nations  the most universally2represented organization. It is very dangerous to takeany action outside such mechanisms. We request thatall actions undertaken must  above all  serve thepurpose of guaranteeing justice  peace and security inthe future world.In particular  we call upon the initiators of amilitary action against Iraq to show great wisdom andresponsibility to ensure that their decisions do notcreate a new world order of insecurity  hatred andconflict  defined by cultural  ethnic and religiousdivisions. All actions taken must be consistent with thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charterand established international law.Although the fight against terrorism has takencentre stage  it must not lead us to forget or to neglectdevelopment issues and security concerns inherent tothe developing world  in particular  to the small islandStates. Some resources will inevitably be reallocated tothe growing problem of security  but it must notovershadow the development agenda of the developingworld. It is in that context that my delegation wishes toassociate itself with the statements made by otherPacific island countries in endorsing the Pacific IslandsForum declarations that have been distributed as aUnited Nations document.The recent World Summit on SustainableDevelopment held in South Africa unambiguouslyreminded us that much remains to be done inaddressing the challenges inherent to the world's manydeveloping economies. The environment and thenegative impact of climate change are of extremeconcern  and we urge those countries that have not yetdone so to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as soon aspossible. The ratifications of Japan  the EuropeanUnion  China and Russia have been most welcome.The aggressive policies of developed countriescontinue to marginalize many of the world's very smalldeveloping economies  such as that of Vanuatu.Binding commitments to international declarations andlegislation are the cornerstone of a peaceful and justworld in which justice prevails above all. There mustbe equitable partnerships and cooperation so that wecan all contribute our support and confidence.While small nations  such as Vanuatu  are beingforced to comply with conditions imposed bydeveloped countries  some of those same nationsdecide at the same time to impose policies thatencroach upon national and regional positions.Vanuatu is firmly opposed to the proliferation ofnuclear weapons in all their forms. In that context  myGovernment once more unreservedly condemns theongoing transfer of radioactive materials in the PacificOcean. The flagrant disregard for national and regionalopposition is a clear demonstration of the policies ofthe powerful. That negligence is shameful in the lightof the many ideals and principles espoused by thisOrganization and its various entities. Given the recentadoption of the Pacific Islands Regional Oceans Policyat the Pacific Islands Leaders Forum in the Republic ofthe Fiji Islands  I strongly call on the shipping States torespect the efforts of the Pacific Island countries tosafeguard their principal resource: the sea.The conditions imposed by the powerful withrespect to the initiatives of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) areanother clear demonstration of the game of thepowerful  in which we see the big nations manipulatingthe world order to their own advantage. Thoseabominable policies affect the very boundaries ofnational sovereignty for the benefit of the developedcountries. We must put an end to all this hypocrisy  ifwe  the small nations  are to be treated fairly and asequal partners in the international community.Vanuatu opposes discriminatory policies andlegislation which expose our vulnerability to a veryvolatile global environment. Some of our nationalefforts to stimulate economic growth are being stifledby the enormous pressure exerted by the club of therich  which does everything to ensure that theirposition prevails. Where does that leave us? I muststress this because Vanuatu has done its best to complywith the OECD initiatives  including throughlegislation to prevent money-laundering and to ensuretransparency in financial transactions. Yet  that rich andinfluential organization continues to put forwardfurther demands. We are ready to negotiate within atime-frame that must first suit our economic andpolitical requirements. But the OECD must  in turn  beready and able to provide immediate relief andsolutions. Any decision by the OECD to blacklistcountries such as Vanuatu is premature andunwarranted. It would serve the interests of the OECDalone. Vanuatu is confronted with a dilemma becausethe countries that introduced the tax-haven policyduring the colonial period continue to placeunreasonable demands on our already weak economy.3On that note  I must also mention the complicatedand extreme difficulties that my country is facing as itstruggles through its reform process. Given theestablished millennium priorities  there is still an acuteshortage of financial assistance necessary to effectivelyimplement national development priorities. We havebecome accustomed to receiving plenty of foreignadvice that is  unfortunately  not backed up by realfinancial support. That has placed an extreme burdenon the already scarce resources available in thecountry. I believe that it is important that ourdevelopment partners try to better understand theparticularities and unique characteristics of not onlyVanuatu but also other small and fragile economies ofthe Pacific islands.The existing ban on exports of kava to Europeand the United States is another indication of the unfairand discriminatory policies practised by the powerfulnations. We expect that other countries will  in turn join the ban. However  there is no scientific evidence tojustify those trade sanctions  which have impactednegatively on the economy of Vanuatu. We thereforeseek the support and understanding of the internationalcommunity in order to allow time for the adequatescientific research to be carried out before such traderestrictions are imposed. Kava products exported toEurope and other destinations are mixed with non-kavaproducts. For the moment  it is completely unfair anddiscriminatory to impose such a ban.My Government fully supports the efforts toreform the United Nations system in order to create astronger and more efficient organization. On this issue my delegation endorses the position of otherdelegations on the need to restructure the membershipof the Security Council so that it may better reflect thegeographical representation and the under-representedgroups of Member States without affecting theCouncil's authority.The question of Taiwan must also be adequatelyaddressed here. Resolution 2758 (XXVI)  adopted bythe General Assembly in 1971  resolved the legal andpolitical representation of the People's Republic ofChina as a Member of the United Nations. Therefore any attempt by Taiwan to gain admission to the UnitedNations or to any of its affiliated organs or specialagencies will not be supported by my Government. TheUnited Nations must ensure that it does not becomeinvolved in the conflict between China and Taiwan which is a matter totally within China's purview.I should also like to take this opportunity tomention the problem of West Papua. At the MillenniumSummit  the then-Prime Minister of Vanuatu touchedon the important matter of the principle of self-determination for the people of West Papua. Thequestion of West Papua has always occupied a specialplace on Vanuatu's foreign policy agenda. The Charterof the United Nations espouses the principles thatcontinue to guide the Organization's efforts with regardto self-determination. We are completely convincedthat  if the United Nations is to be consistent in itsdecisions to promote recognition and respect of thefundamental right to self-determination  the question ofWest Papua must be placed on the agenda of theSpecial Committee on the Situation with regard to theImplementation of the Declaration on the Granting ofIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Theclosed-door policy with regard to the pleas of WestPapuans continues to undermine the credibility of theUnited Nations in terms of its ability to address anessential matter. I think it is in the best interests of theinternational community that the question of WestPapua be revisited. We also request that a commissionof inquiry be deployed to verify information onatrocities alleged to have been committed in WestPapua.In conclusion  we must continue to support thepivotal role of the United Nations in efforts to create ajust and equitable world. We must stem the growinggap between the developed and developing worlds inorder to guarantee economic and social prosperity forall — a critical prerequisite to guaranteeing politicalstability  peace and security throughout the world. Theeffective implementation of the United Nations agendafor development  in particular the MillenniumDeclaration and the Monterrey and JohannesburgDeclarations  will advance that process. A morefavourable international environment will assist thedevelopmental priorities of developing countries andwill address the great economic imbalances prevailingtoday. True goodwill  respect  tolerance and equalitywill be necessary if we are to move forward. The roleof the United Nations will be crucial in that process but only if support is forthcoming from its Members."
"183",7472,"WSM",57,2002,"﻿I congratulate you  Sir on your election as President of the General Assembly.Our annual gatherings in this great Hall servewell to reaffirm our commitment to the purposes of theUnited Nations: the commitment to uphold theprinciples of the Charter  to assert fundamental humanrights and freedoms as we seek to improve social andeconomic conditions  and to act together in sovereigntyin the maintenance of international peace and security.The lessons of history require that nations be united incommon effort. There is no other way; not today  inthis interdependent  ever globalizing world. Certainly from the perspective of the very small there is no otherway. Indeed  we cannot see how any one country  nomatter what its size and power  can completely fend foritself.War and conflict divide nations. They rage in toomany places. Global forces operate to degrade theenvironment and spread misery through poverty anddisease and through the illicit trade in arms  drugs andpeople. The entire world community is now seriouslychallenged by the terrible scourges of HIV/AIDS andterrorism. Only through cooperation and multilateralaction can we hope to respond  to takecountermeasures  to find solutions and to giveprotection to all.The monstrous terrorist attacks on the UnitedStates on 11 September 2001 were an assault on valuesthat are fundamental to humanity and to the UnitedNations. On behalf of my country  I want to renew tothe people of the United States our feelings ofsolidarity and total support. The spirit of the UnitedStates was never in doubt. Tested  it has become moreresolute in its purpose and courage. It is that spirit thatprovides global leadership. It is the spirit that unites usall in the struggle against terrorism.Let me reaffirm our strong support for SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and for the Council'saction to implement it. For its part  Samoa has put inplace appropriate policies and domestic legislation  andwe will review our arrangements as necessary  inkeeping with the work of the Counter-TerrorismCommittee.Iraq continues to violate Security Councilresolutions. It has done so for a considerable time far too long. We commend Secretary-General KofiAnnan for his repeated efforts to encouragecompliance. We think there must be full compliancewith obligations pursuant to Security Councilresolutions: compliance without preconditions  withoutdelay.We welcome the broad acknowledgement in thestatements we have heard in this debate that actionsthat need to be taken will be taken within theframework of the United Nations and under theauthority of the Security Council. The news thismorning of the likely return of weapons inspectors is apositive development  and we hope it is one ofcomplete seriousness.Our concern about Iraq reflects in part our veryserious concern about the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction  chemical  biological and nuclearweapons. Those weapons pose an immediate and majorthreat to international peace and security. Theinternational agreements and systems to control thedevelopment and spread of weapons of massdestruction  and to eliminate them  must bestrengthened and implemented.We live in a part of the world where nuclearweapons have been tested and used. Our fear of theconsequences is real. That is why we have theRarotonga Treaty  which declared the South Pacific anuclear-weapon-free-zone. We call on States that havenot yet done so to complete the ratification process ofthe protocols to the Treaty. And that is why wecontinue to object to the transportation of nuclear andother radioactive material through the waters of ourregion.8We are appalled at the suffering of families andcommunities in the Middle East  and we pray forpermanent peace for all. The current situation is athreat of utmost gravity to international peace andsecurity. It calls for efforts of highest priority andurgency to bring an end to the conflict. SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 1397(2001) provide the basis for a settlement. Thoseresolutions should be implemented.My delegation strongly supports the Secretary-General in the ongoing reform of the United Nations.We have all seen good and positive results. Reform tomake the General Assembly and the Economic andSocial Council more effective must continue. Reformof the Security Council calls for particular attention.The issues are sensitive and complex. That is clear.Yet  it is also clear that the Security Council needs toreflect the geopolitical realities of our time. It needs tobe properly representative of the internationalcommunity of today and to be able to functioneffectively and be secure in its authority.We applaud the entry into force of the RomeStatute that established the International CriminalCourt. Samoa has now ratified the Statute. The Courtwill bring to justice those who commit genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes. It is therefore  a major achievement and a significant step inthe protection of human rights and in upholdinginternational humanitarian standards. To that end  theCourt deserves all support to allow it the strength ofuniversality and the rule of law. We need to ensure thatit is not undermined in any way.This has been an especially notable year in theinternational efforts to realize the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. In March  we achieved theMonterrey Consensus. Earlier this month  we agreed inJohannesburg on a Plan to implement sustainabledevelopment in every land. Rightly  the focus is onhalving extreme poverty by 2015. The condition ofutter misery that condemns so many of our fellowhumans worldwide is simply unacceptable. Theoutstanding leadership of South Africa ensured thesuccess of the Johannesburg Summit. We extend toPresident Mbeki  to his ministers and to his othercolleagues our warm thanks and congratulations.In this context  let me also congratulate theleadership of Africa on the establishment of theAfrican Union and the creation of the New Partnershipfor Africa's Development (NEPAD). We have joinedhands with Africa on other issues  including ourendeavours in the context of cooperation between theGroup of African  Caribbean and Pacific States and theEuropean Union  and I give assurance of our closeinterest and support.Speaking in Samoa's capacity as Chairman of theAlliance of Small Island States  let me note ourparticular satisfaction with the provisions in theJohannesburg Plan of Implementation dedicated to thesustainable development of small island States. Wegreatly appreciate the role played by all countries infinding agreement on those provisions. We lookforward to their continuing support as we move toprepare for the agreed international meeting in 2004 toreview the Barbados Programme of Action.Overcoming the well-recognized vulnerability of smallisland States  and the exposure of island countries tothe effects of global climate change  natural disasters environmental damage and global economic shocks isfundamental to long-term sustainability in all smallisland regions.Climate change poses immediate and the mostserious of threats for our communities. Largely by theacts of others  it puts at risk countries like my own thatare least responsible for the causes and least able toadapt. In Johannesburg  we were greatly heartened bythe declarations from many countries  the RussianFederation  China  India and Canada among them  oftheir plans to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. This seriousproblem deserves no less than this type of globalsolidarity and leadership.As I close  let me welcome Switzerland upon itshaving taken up full membership of the UnitedNations. Switzerland's role and its contribution to theOrganization are known to all and are well appreciated.Let me also voice our satisfaction with thesituation in East Timor. It is a success story in everysense: in the determination of its people and in theresponse of the international community. Samoa ispleased to have been able to contribute to the UnitedNations peacekeeping effort in that country; we plan tocontinue doing so. Last month  we welcomed EastTimor as an observer to the Pacific Islands Forum. Welook forward to its joining the United Nations soon."
"184",7518,"YEM",57,2002,"﻿At theoutset  I would like to express to you  Sir  our warmestcongratulations on your election to the presidency ofthis session and to wish you every success conductingthe affairs of this session. Your ample diplomatic skillsare well known. I wish also to thank your predecessorfor his good conduct of the preceding session. I alsowish to extend my thanks to His Excellency theSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan for the quality of30the report that he presented to us on the work of ourOrganization and to wish him further success in thedischarge of his tasks.I am pleased in this connection to convey to youand all the participants in this session the greetings ofHis Excellency President Abdullah Saleh of Yemen and his sincere wish that the work of this session behighly successful  particularly when it is conveningunder grave and internationally importantcircumstances.This fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly of the United Nations is being held while theworld still vividly remembers the terrorist acts and thetragic and terrifying disaster  which befell the UnitedStates on 11 September 2001 and which represented agrave development in terrorist acts. This awakened theinternational community  requiring it to mobilize all itspotential to face that threat to international peace andstability. The proliferation of international terrorismand the exorbitant price it has imposed on manypeoples and States  including my country  has madefighting terrorism an obligation and a responsibility forsafeguarding peace  stability and development.My country was among the first States to sufferfrom terrorism and its harmful repercussions still affectus. We have not hesitated to face that danger. Prior tothe September 2001 events  we drew the attention ofthe international community to the need to unify effortsto combat terrorism and eradicate it before it took root.While doing its best to combat terrorism  mycountry has emphasized the need to convene aninternational conference on terrorism under theauspices of the United Nations so that we can reach aunified definition thereof. We emphasize the need todistinguish between terrorism and the right of peoplesto resist occupation. We need to end the causes thatcreate a fertile climate for fostering terrorism.Israeli violence and terrorism levelled against thedefenceless Palestinian people constitute a genuineobstacle to the achievement of a just andcomprehensive peace and create hotbeds of extremismand terrorism. Such violence impedes internationalefforts and initiatives to solve the Middle Eastquestion  while threatening stability  security andprosperity in the region. It also increases the incidenceof violence and extremism and presages unpredictableconsequences. Consequently  the internationalcommunity must exert the utmost pressure on Israel toimplement Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) 338 (1973) and 1397 (2002)  and General Assemblyresolution 194 (III) of 1948 and to withdraw from alloccupied Arab territories — Palestinian  Syrian andLebanese — and return to the 4 June 1967 borders. Theinternational community must work towardsestablishing a Palestinian State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.We reiterate our position that the Arab peaceinitiative constitutes an integrated framework for theachievement of peace. Peace for Israel will not beachieved unless it withdraws from the occupiedPalestinian territories  helps to re-establish thePalestinian security institutions and grants thePalestinian Authority control over its own territory.We stress that the Palestinian people are solelyresponsible for choosing their leadership andrepresentatives for negotiating a final settlement. Inthis connection  we look forward to the outcome of theefforts led by the United States and the other membersof the “quartet” to solve the Middle East question. Wehope that the United States vision will be transformedinto a time-bound programme that will lay downguidelines to prevent Israel from circumventing anynew agreement  as it did those of Oslo  Camp Davidand Sharm el-Sheikh  through recent statements bySharon.Since the Republic of Yemen is interested in thesecurity and stability of the Middle East  we emphasizethe need for Israel to get rid of its nuclear arsenal andto subject its nuclear facilities to internationalsupervision. Israel should strive to free the Middle Eastregion of weapons of mass destruction.The policy of imposing sanctions on some Araband Islamic countries  Iraq in particular  should betackled to ease the considerable harm done to the Iraqipeople. Here  I emphasize my country's position thatthe sanctions imposed on Iraq should be lifted. Wereject the use of force against Iraq as long as it abidesby international resolutions.Yemen warns of the gravity of using force againstIraq. We also warn of the disastrous consequences forthe region if force is used and if waging war takesprecedence over solving the problem peacefully. Apeaceful approach  such as bringing back the inspectorsand clearing up the doubts about Iraq's possession ofweapons of mass destruction  should be taken. We callfor the lifting of sanctions against Libya  Sudan and31Cuba and for continuing dialogue as a means toachieve fair settlements  to safeguard the rights of theconcerned parties and to respect their sovereignty andsystems of government.Based on our interest in the situation in Somaliaand our endeavours to achieve peace and stabilitythere  we call on the international community tointensify its efforts to bring peace to that country andto support the peace process led by theIntergovernmental Authority on Development  so as topreserve the security  territorial integrity andsovereignty of Somalia. We are ready to contribute tothis international political endeavour.My country is of the view that current efforts toreform and restructure the United Nations  includingSecurity Council reform  should enhance theOrganization's role and achieve broader participationand more equitable representation in the Council  inkeeping with the principles of the sovereign equality ofStates and equitable geographical distribution.Yemen attaches great importance to theMillennium Declaration adopted during the MillenniumSummit. It paves the way to new relations in thetwenty-first century; it calls for encouraging dialogueamong civilizations and for the spread of the culture ofpeace; and it calls on richer States to shoulder theirresponsibility towards least developed countries infacing the challenges of poverty and deadly disease. Infact  we have not seen the implementation of any ofthose principles. We therefore call upon States to abideby the Millennium Declaration and implement it inorder to engender better relations between the rich andthe poor; to remove the spectre of the clash ofcivilizations and races; to enhance the high principlesand values of religions; and to remove the distortedview of the tolerant Islamic religion that has beenpropagated by others.The developing countries are suffering fromdifficult economic conditions due to poverty unemployment  declining living standards  over-population  mismanagement  debt servicing  and soforth  in addition to the burdens imposed by neweconomic policies. For these States to be fullyintegrated into the international economy  they neednew opportunities and support so that they can buildtheir economies and carry out administrative andeconomic structural reforms. They need furtherfinancial assistance and opportunities to compete  aswell as technology transfers on concessional terms.They should also benefit from investments andcooperation  and free trade zones need to beestablished. We should try to implement therecommendations of the Third United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries andcancel the accumulated debts of those countries.My Government is making strenuous efforts toachieve full development  to complete the building ofan infrastructure  and to eliminate poverty. Thus  wehave implemented a programme of administrative financial and economic reform  and have updated theinvestment law to attract foreign capital  with a view tobolstering the service and economic sectors. We havebegun a carefully prepared and well balancedprivatization programme and are making efforts to jointhe World Trade Organization and integrate ourselvesinto world economy.At this session  we look forward to the adoptionof important resolutions that will enhance our jointcampaign to achieve security and stability  welfare andprosperity for our peoples. I am confident that ourconcerted efforts will lead to the success of this sessionand will help us achieve the results we desire.In conclusion  I would like to extend mycongratulations to Switzerland on its admission as aMember of the Organization and to Timor-Leste on itscoming admission. They will make a fresh contributionto the United Nations."
"185",7556,"YUG",57,2002,"﻿It is a great honour andprivilege for me  as the first democratically electedPresident of Yugoslavia in nearly 60 years  to addressthis gathering of world leaders. Against the solemnbackground of yesterday's commemoration and thechallenges that confront us  I would like to share withthe General Assembly my views on developments inSouth-East Europe.Before I begin my remarks  allow me to expressmy deep satisfaction at the election of Mr. Jan Kavanto preside over the fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly. His leadership and experience make himuniquely qualified to guide the extremely importantwork of this body.I also wish to extend my congratulations toSwitzerland on joining the United Nations  and toTimor-Leste on its forthcoming accession tomembership.Nearly two years have elapsed since democracyreturned to Yugoslavia ─ two years of concerted effortsby my country to alleviate the consequences of adecade of civil war  build democratic institutions establish the rule of law  carry out market reforms andfulfil its obligations to the international community.After a 10-year delay  Yugoslavia has joined the largegroup of other European countries in transition that arebuilding their future on the common values of respectfor human rights  democracy  free-market economiesand a commitment to European and Euro-Atlanticintegration.What distinguishes my country from most otherCentral and Eastern European States is that during thatsame decade Yugoslavia experienced the largest armedconflict in Europe since the Second World War. Thedissolution of the former Yugoslavia  the civil warswaged on its soil and the subsequent NATO bombinghave left continuing effects on the well-being of thecitizens of my country  and on that of the citizens ofmost of South-East Europe. Yugoslavia knows only toowell that peace in the region  attained at great sacrifice must never be threatened again.The efforts we have made to that end over thepast two years  and the good political relations we haveestablished with our neighbours  have strengthened myhope that an inter-State armed conflict in our region isunlikely to happen either today or in the foreseeablefuture. There are still threats to lasting peace in theworld and in the region alike. Those threats come fromideological  religious  ethnic and political extremism which fuel hatred and sow fear among our peoples.Organized crime is often linked with thatextremism  and is the lifeblood of terrorism. Eventhough terrorism and organized crime in South-EastEurope are rather specific in their characteristics  thereare many links to leading terrorist and criminal groupsthroughout the world. I am here to reaffirm mycountry's firm commitment to the struggle against thisthreat. I am also confident that the United Nations isthe right place for the coordination of internationalefforts to rid the world of this evil. This struggle willnot be easy but  together  the community of democraticnations can prevail through cooperation and a unifiedresponse to potential threats  regardless of where theymay emanate from.In addition to the security and military measuresthat we undertake  we must also be equally committedto using other methods to eradicate the conditions thatbreed terrorists. We must attack global poverty andinjustice throughout the world with the samecommitment and resolution with which we confrontterrorism. We must reach out to the generation ofyoung impoverished children  who are targets forterrorist recruitment and manipulation  by providingthem with hope through education and economicopportunity.6The stabilization of our region requirescontinuous action not only by the States of the regionbut also by the entire international community. Mycountry has finally undertaken a constitutionaltransformation  with facilitation by the EuropeanUnion  in order to define the relations between its twomember republics  Serbia and Montenegro. This willmake our integration with the rest of Europe easier andquicker. Our success requires the success of ourneighbours. When it comes to Bosnia and Herzegovina Yugoslavia is a fervent advocate of the fullimplementation of the Dayton Accords. In fact  we area guarantor of those Accords.As in all other cases  our goal is to open borders not to change them. We want to promote the flow ofpeople and goods  thus restoring the broken ties thatbound us to each other. I am pleased to see that thispolicy has produced significant results  although I haveto say that slow economic recovery hinders our efforts especially in the area of refugee returns. Yugoslavia  incooperation with Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to do its part in establishing the trust andcooperation between our three States that will benefitour citizens. I am proud that Yugoslavia will host thenext summit of these States  which is scheduled to beheld in Belgrade this autumn.I am saddened that the situation in Kosovo is farless encouraging. Some progress has been made sinceSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999) was adopted and since the United Nations Interim AdministrationMission in Kosovo (UNMIK) arrived in the province.With the enormous help and understanding ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan  a bright spot wasreached through the agreement with SpecialRepresentative Hans Haekkerup on cooperationbetween the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia andUNMIK in November 2001. Unfortunately  Kosovoremains a factor of political instability and a centre fororganized criminal networks that transit our region andstretch from Central Asia to South America. There islittle doubt that these networks cooperate withextremist and terrorist groups in our region andbeyond.Another problem with Kosovo is the desperateplight of the close to 250 000 Serbs  Montenegrins andother non-Albanians who desire to return to theirhomes but who remain displaced  mostly in centralSerbia. Unlike the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina less that one per cent of Kosovo's population ofinternally displaced persons has returned. To makematters worse  the fate of more than 5 000 abductedand missing persons is yet to be uncovered. During thelast two years  Kosovo's instability twice spilled overinto neighbouring areas  first into the Presevo valley insouthern Serbia  and then into the western part ofMacedonia. Regardless of the fact that Serbs and othersparticipate in Kosovo's provisional institutions  this hasnot led to an improvement in the security situation orto the establishment of complete freedom ofmovement. Without immediate and noticeableimprovement in those two areas  a more massive returnof internally displaced persons is unlikely. All of that along with the reluctance of Kosovo Albanian politicalleaders to enter into dialogue with us  makes isimpossible to begin a serious discussion on the finalstatus of Kosovo.Yugoslavia will continue to do its part inestablishing the conditions for a democratic andpeaceful solution to this open issue. To that end  I ampleased that we will upgrade to the ambassadorial leveldiplomatic relations with our neighbour  the Republicof Albania. I am confident that the cooperationbetween our two countries will continue and thatjointly we will be in a better position to find solutionsto outstanding problems.Let me stress that we are fully aware of ourinternational commitments and that we will meet them not because this is demanded of us but because wedesire to establish a democratic society based on therule of law.I believe that  at the conceptual level  the finalpoint I am going to make is the most important becauseit determines everything else. The world mustunderstand that change has truly taken place inYugoslavia and that no authoritarian regime has anychance there anymore. Sometimes there is mistrusttowards my country; this is almost unbelievable. Thereis still prejudice against us  as if nothing has changed whereas actually a great deal has changed  andsubstantially. The political situation is still evolving.There are still disagreements among the variousplayers. But this is perfectly normal for a transitionalperiod. Nothing should serve as a pretext forcontinuing a policy of conditionality towards us  or forattempts to interfere in our internal affairs. Wecontinue often to see how such an approach is usuallycounter-productive  not to mention the time itwastes."
"186",7584,"ZAF",57,2002,"﻿I would like to join in thankingthe outgoing President of the General Assembly for thediligent manner in which he managed the affairs of theAssembly. I would also like to congratulate you Mr. President  for taking over the leadership of theAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. We hope that youwill have a successful tenure in your stewardship ofthis important body.Allow us to also welcome Switzerland and EastTimor to membership of the United Nations.Two years ago  the world's political leaders metat this place and  through the historic United NationsMillennium Declaration  reaffirmed our faith in theUnited Nations Organization and its Charter asindispensable foundations of a more peaceful prosperous and just world. That an unprecedentednumber of heads of State and Government had gatheredat the United Nations to make that commitment tocooperation among the peoples of the world — topeace  prosperity and justice throughout ouruniverse — gave hope to the billions throughout theworld who know the painful meaning of oppression by10another  of war and violent conflict  of poverty andinjustice.None of those who spoke from this podium knewthat a year after they had pledged to use their energiesand talents to provide a meaningful life for all  peace inthis country and the rest of the world would be brutallychallenged by the murderous terrorist attack of 11September. We meet a day after the anniversary of thatfateful 11 September. We have a collective duty toreaffirm our united resolve to create a world free of thefear of terrorism. We have a common task to ensurethat this Organization truly lives up to its obligations todo all the things that make for peace. We have a solemnobligation to give real meaning to the message of hopewe proclaimed in the Millennium Declaration. It maybe that future generations will say that if we havelearned anything at all from the horrendous events of11 September  it is that the General Assembly shoulddedicate its efforts to the accomplishment of thesetasks.In keeping with that perspective  we have come tothe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly toreport that the peoples of Africa have risen to thosechallenges by forming the African Union. Our Union isbased on the principles enshrined in the Charter of theUnited Nations. It results from the transformation ofthe Organization of African Unity  which championedthe cause of the unity and independence of Africa fornearly 40 years. The African Union is Africa'spractical and determined response to its past andpresent  in favour of peace and stability  democracyand human rights  cooperation  development prosperity and human dignity. Its programme for thesocio-economic revitalization of our continent is theNew Partnership for Africa's Development  which musthelp us to eradicate poverty and underdevelopmentthroughout Africa and  within the context of theAfrican Union  end Africa's humiliation as an object ofcharity.Clearly  the objectives of the African Union andthe programme enunciated in the New Partnershipessentially  and of necessity  seek to advance the aimscontained in the Millennium Development Goals.Naturally  the United Nations — as an Organizationseized of the task to address the critical issues of peace human rights and poverty eradication within theframework of sustainable development — will foreverbe central to the success of the African Union and theaccomplishment of the goals of the New Partnershipfor Africa's Development. Accordingly  on behalf ofthe united peoples of Africa  we are honoured andprivileged to commend to this Organization both theAfrican Union and the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment. We are convinced that with the supportof the United Nations  we will transform this into anAfrican century.We are happy that there are encouraging peaceprocesses in Angola  Burundi  the Democratic Republicof the Congo and the Sudan  with the Comoros alreadyhaving held successful elections. We are particularlypleased because these positive developments willcreate the possibility for millions of our fellowAfricans to reaffirm the sanctity of human life andsecurity and to engage in the important tasks ofrebuilding their countries to bring about a better life forall.As part of our commitment to wage a sustainedstruggle to realize the long-deferred hopes of thepeoples of Africa  we have agreed to the establishmentof various institutions  including a peer-reviewmechanism  which must help us ensure that we honourour commitments to democracy  human rights and goodgovernance. I am confident that the United Nations willwork closely with the African Union and that thispremier Organization of the peoples of the world willuse its vast and invaluable experience to ensure that theAfrican Union delivers on the important and pressingduty of achieving sustainable development in each andevery country on our continent.Together  the agencies of the United Nations andthe organs of the African Union must give priority tosuch matters as human resources development andcapacity-building  modernizing Africa's economy dealing decisively with the intolerable debt burden ensuring access of our products to the markets of thedeveloped world  spreading the emancipation andempowerment of women  combating communicableand other diseases — including AIDS  malaria andtuberculosis — and fighting against environmentaldegradation.At the end of August and the beginning of thismonth  the people of South Africa and Africa werehonoured to host the World Summit for SustainableDevelopment. A number of far-reaching decisions weretaken at that important Summit to ensure that we willbequeath to the next generations a better  humane andequitable world based on what we agree are the11inseparable pillars of sustainable development:economic development  social development andenvironmental protection. Delegates from around theworld enshrined the decisions they took in theJohannesburg Plan of Implementation and theJohannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Developmentto ensure that the billions of people who have placedtheir fate on our collective shoulders have a concreteprogramme of action to realize the goals contained inAgenda 21 and other documents adopted by the worldcommunity of nations during the last 10 years.The Johannesburg Summit confronted the starkreality that billions of people across the world are poor and it boldly confirmed the need for us to collaboratefor a shared human prosperity through sustainabledevelopment. We agree that this goal can be achievedbecause we are inspired by the knowledge that theresources needed exist within the global community.Indeed  Member States have already committedthemselves to make available the means necessary forthe implementation of our plans  especially finance technology and capacity-building.It is critically important that we implementeverything we agreed  acting with the necessary senseof urgency. Again  this we will do together  under theleadership of the United Nations  while we continue tostrengthen the multilateral system of global governanceas the only viable international response to all ourchallenges. Fundamentally  this is the only credibleresponse to the challenge of globalization and the needto enhance human solidarity to meet our commonneeds.It has been our privilege to chair the Non-AlignedMovement for the past four years. During that time  theMovement has ensured constant dialogue between thecountries of the North and South  which has advancedthe commonality of interest between States  confirmingthe view that the future of all humanity is interlinked.We are pleased that the views of the Movement havehelped to inform the advance towards a better life forall  to which we have all committed ourselves by wordand deed.In February next year  Malaysia will assume theresponsibility of guiding our Movement as it respondsto the changed and changing global environment. I amcertain that this will add new strength to the Non-Aligned Movement in the interests of all humanity especially the poor of the world. As before  the Non-Aligned Movement is committed to the peacefulresolution of all conflicts  including those pertaining toPalestine and Israel  as well as Iraq  in keeping with theresolutions of the United Nations. These are urgenttasks to which the Organization must respond.In conclusion  let me recall that two years ago inthe Millennium Declaration more than 150 heads ofState or Government resolved that “we believe that thecentral challenge we face today is to ensure thatglobalization becomes a positive force for all theworld's people” (resolution 55/2  para. 5). Throughboth our global and our regional programmes we canand must ensure that globalization indeed becomes avaluable process which will bring about sustainabledevelopment and prosperity for all.From this fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly must surely issue the unequivocal messagethat the peoples of the world are united in their resolveto sustain the message of hope by advancing the goalsof peace  of democracy  of prosperity and ofsustainable development."
"187",7626,"ZMB",57,2002,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on your assumption of thePresidency of the fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly. My delegation is confident that  given yourvast political skills  you will execute yourresponsibility as President of the fifty-seventh sessionof the United Nations General Assembly mosthonourably.My delegation pledges its total support andcooperation to you in the discharge of your importantresponsibilities. You can depend on Zambia's supportand cooperation.May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute toyour predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-sooof the Republic of Korea  for the excellent manner in4which he presided over the fifty-sixth session of theUnited Nations General Assembly.My delegation also congratulates the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for the ablemanner in which he has steered the work of the UnitedNations.We are happy to welcome Switzerland and EastTimor as new Members of the United Nations family.My delegation looks forward to working closely withthe two new Member States.Three days ago  the world commemorated the 1stanniversary of the tragic events of 11 September 2001.The past year has witnessed a global resolve to fightinternational terrorism. My Government wishes to jointhe host country in remembering the tragic events of 11September 2001.My delegation salutes the efforts of the UnitedNations in ensuring that there is peace in the world. Iam pleased to note that there are signs of positivedevelopments in most of the trouble spots where therehave been conflicts.The African Union and the internationalcommunity have to work together as partners inconflict prevention and peace-building. In the pastforty years  Africa has lost too much blood throughconflicts. Zambia is ready and willing to play her partto create in Africa a culture of respect for the rule oflaw and human rights  social and economicdevelopment  and to promote peace and security. Inthis regard we welcome the positive signs towardspeace in Angola  Burundi  the Democratic Republic ofCongo and other conflict areas in Africa.The search for peace is a continuous process. Itherefore appeal to the international community tocontinue extending assistance to bring about peace inthe conflict areas around the world.It is against this background that my Governmentwelcomes the implementation of the Lusaka PeaceProtocol in Angola and the Democratic Republic ofCongo. Since the death of Dr. Jonas Savimbi  theformer UNITA rebel leader  in February 2002  theprospects for peace in that country and the entiresubregion are encouraging.The ceasefire agreement  signed between theAngolan Government and the UNITA military  furtherpaved way for the implementation of the Lusaka PeaceProtocol of November 1994.The full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol isvital for the reintegration of Angola in the SouthernAfrican economy and the promotion of regional peaceand stability. The people of Angola require the moraland material support of the international community tocomplete that process.I would like also to express my country'sappreciation to the United Nations Security Council forthe measures being undertaken to strengthen the UnitedNations Organization Mission in the DemocraticRepublic of Congo (MONUC). I am further gratifiedthat the efforts by His Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire former President of Botswana  to promote internalpolitical dialogue are bearing fruit. I also wish to note with appreciation  that the number of foreign troopsstill on Democratic Republic of Congo soil has beensignificantly reduced.Conflicts have a negative impact on the economiclife of the region. To Zambia  as a host to refugeesfrom Angola  the Democratic Republic of the Congoand other parts of the continent  the recent signs ofpeace are significantly important. My Governmenthopes that these positive signs will result in thevoluntary repatriation of refugees to their countries.Currently  there are 270 000 refugees in designatedcamps and about 120 000 others who aresimultaneously settled in the border areas among thelocal people in Zambia. My Government will continueto require the material and financial support of theinternational community to help in the refugeemanagement effort.Since the thirty-seventh session of the Assemblyof the former Organization of African Unity  held inLusaka in July 2001  Africa has continued to refine itspartnerships with the rest of the world to fosterdevelopment. The vehicle for this effort is the NewPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). I wishto convey my Government's appreciation to the leadersof the Group of 8 for endorsing the NEPAD programmeduring their annual meeting  held in Kananaskis Canada  on 27 June 2002. I note with appreciation thatthe G8 countries considered positively the request bythe four-nation African representatives of Algeria Nigeria  Senegal and South Africa  that they earmarkfor Africa 50 per cent of their projected foreign aidincreases in the coming years. I wish to thank the5European Union  which has supported the NEPADprogramme and remains committed to its pledge ofsupport for the initiative.The past year has seen practical and positivedevelopments in the response of the cooperatingpartners to African trade liberalization initiatives. Inthis regard  I wish to take this opportunity to welcomethe initiative of the United States Government to refinethe scope of the African Growth and Opportunity Actto increase the number of products eligible to beexported to the United States.In the health sector  Africa is experiencing thecatastrophic impact of a combination of the HIV/AIDSpandemic and a series of outbreaks of such diseases asmalaria  tuberculosis and diarrhoea. Unfortunately  mycountry is one of those hard hit in this regard. Althoughmy Government has implemented health reforms thatfocus on ameliorating the situation  far more resourcesare required to address the problem.My Government has taken a decision to acquireaffordable antiretroviral drugs for distribution topeople affected with AIDS. My delegation wishes toexpress its gratitude to our cooperating partners  whohave been forthcoming in providing resources for thiseffort. Early deaths from HIV/AIDS-related illnessesare robbing the country of skilled professionals andcreating large numbers of orphaned children.As members are aware  a combination of naturaland other factors has caused a food shortage and crisisin the southern African subregion. In response to thisimpending catastrophe  on 18 July 2002 the UnitedNations World Food Programme launched an appeal forfood aid in support of the affected areas. In response tothe food shortage  a number of countries andinternational organizations have pledged their support.My delegation pays tribute to the United Nations andother cooperating partners in providing assistance toZambia to mitigate the food shortfall.However  it has come to the Government'sattention that some of the food aid products offered toZambia constituted genetically modified organisms(GMOs). The offer of genetically modified foods hascreated a difficult situation for the Government. While on the one hand  we are determined to procure foodand seed for the mostly rural population that is hardesthit by the food shortage  we have expressed concernover the true impact of GMOs on our people and soil.Due to our low scientific and technological base Government has opted for the procurement of non-GMO food products. It is not my Government'sintention to sacrifice the lives of the Zambian peopleby taking this position. However  given the lack of andoften conflicting international information on thepossible effects of genetically modified products onhumans  I therefore wish to request Members'understanding of Zambia's position on GMOs. In thisregard  my Government has accepted an offer from theUnited States Government for Zambian scientists tovisit America to study first-hand the GMO factor. Theirfindings will help us to map out a way forward and tomake informed decisions and choices.In conclusion  I wish the General Assembly at itsfifty-seventh session successful deliberations of theissues before it. I wish to appeal to all Member Statesto ensure the rapid implementation of decisionsemanating therefrom."
"188",7662,"ZWE",57,2002,"﻿I would like to congratulateMr. Jan Kavan on his assumption of the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I amconfident that his leadership will successfully carry usthrough this session. We extend to his predecessor Mr. Han Seung-soo  our sincere appreciation for theexcellent manner in which he steered the work of therecently concluded fifty-sixth session of the GeneralAssembly.My delegation warmly welcomes Switzerland asa new Member of this family of nations. I would beremiss if I did not pay tribute to the United Nations forits role in ensuring the smooth transition of East Timorto statehood. We believe that the new nation will forsome time continue to require the support of theinternational community in its efforts at nation-building. We look forward to welcoming East Timorinto the United Nations in the near future.Yesterday  the United States and  indeed  thewhole world  commemorated the first anniversary ofthe horrific terrorist attacks on New York andWashington. Terrorism is a threat to international peaceand security. No matter where it occurs  no matterwhom it is directed at and no matter what form it takes the scourge of terrorism must be condemned and dealtwith decisively and in conformity with the ideals andprinciples of the United Nations Charter. The adoptionof unilateral measures by some countries to combatterrorism not only is counterproductive but alsoundermines the mandate and effectiveness of theUnited Nations. In dealing with this scourge  the worldcommunity needs to focus on identifying andaddressing its root causes  such as poverty  the denialof fundamental freedoms and the absence of socialjustice.The United Nations is confronted with a volatilesituation in the Middle East that has the potential toengulf the entire subregion. The Palestinian questionshould be resolved without further delay  as it iscausing untold suffering to the people in the occupied25territories. Israel must withdraw its forces fromPalestinian lands  and the Palestinians must be affordedthe opportunity of having a State of their own. Thecarnage that is going on at present will benefit neitherside. Israel must know that its chances for peace andsecurity lie in having a Palestinian State that will liveside by side with it in mutual respect betweensovereign States.We believe that Palestinians should be left aloneto elect the leaders of their choice  as it is theirdemocratic and sovereign right to do. It is only leadersthus elected who can ensure peace and stability withinthe State of Palestine and between Palestine and all ofits neighbours. We note with concern that somecountries wish to arrogate to themselves the right tochoose or impose leadership in developing countries bysidelining or overthrowing democratically electedGovernments. Not only is this a negation of democracyand democratic principles  but it constitutes outrightinterference in the internal affairs of independentsovereign States  and must be resisted. I say this inrelation not only to other States but also to my owncountry. My people elected me  and that election washeld to have been valid by Africa and its organizations.But Europe said  “No” — and it was Europe thatyesterday was our oppressor and colonialist. Europesaid “No”  but Africa said  “Yes”. To whom do welisten? The whites in Europe or the blacks in Africa?We listen to our own blacks and their judgement; theyare our people. They  and no one else  are the ones whoshould elect us.Zimbabwe welcomes the emergence of peace inAngola — a fellow member of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community — and urges both sides tothe conflict to remain committed to the Memorandumof Understanding signed earlier this year. Theinternational community should urgently assist thatcountry in consolidating the peace  and move on withthe reconstruction and rehabilitation process. This is asmall price to pay in order to give the people of Angolathe peace that has eluded them since the 1950s.We are also pleased that the peace process in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo is moving in theright direction. We would like to recognize the effortsof the Government of South Africa and the UnitedNations in this regard and to call on the United Nationsto take strong measures against those who violate theagreed ceasefire.Let me take this opportunity to announce onceagain that  in view of these positive developments Zimbabwe is in the process of withdrawing itsremaining forces from the Democratic Republic of theCongo. We hope  however  that the Security Councilwill act boldly and without favour in ensuring thatpeace is consolidated in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo and that it will immediately proceed withthe full deployment of the third phase of the UnitedNations Organization Mission in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo.In the same vein  we note that the mandate of theExpert Panel on the Illegal Exploitation of NaturalResources and Other Forms of Wealth in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo expires inDecember 2002. It is our fervent hope that this time thePanel will have the courage to fully expose theeconomic agenda of the countries that invaded theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.We are gathered here to chart the way forwardtowards the creation of a world fit for all of us  to theturn of the century and beyond. We are meeting againstthe backdrop of the crucial summits that were held thisyear  during which landmark decisions were maderegarding sustainable global economic and socialdevelopment. Among these were the MonterreyInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  and the recently concluded WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  held inJohannesburg  South Africa. It is our hope that thedecisions of these conferences will be translated intomeaningful cooperation among development partners.In this context  we welcome the pledges made forincreased development aid and the commitment tosustainable development  which are essential for futuregenerations.Unfortunately  the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment demonstrated beyond doubt theunwillingness on the part of some developed countriesto commit themselves more meaningfully to theseinternational undertakings. They preferred instead tohide behind hackneyed and spurious conditionalitieswhich all but oppose and negate the practice ofdemocracy  good governance and respect for humanrights in the developing world. While we all cherishthese values  we are dismayed that they areincreasingly being used by developed countries thathave checkered democratic credentials and poor humanrights records in order to settle political scores and to26forestall the economic development of countries whoseGovernments they do not like. When we see these samecountries propping up regimes that are blatantlyundemocratic  we cannot but conclude that this wilfulcommingling of issues is just an excuse for doingnothing about legitimate demands that the developmentaspirations of developing countries be addressed. TheUnited Nations General Assembly should express itsdeep dismay at such dishonest attempts on the part ofthose countries and call upon them to stop the abuse ofinternational agreements and shared values and theimposition of their interests upon other  often smallernations.We call for improved global governance throughthe democratization of multilateral organizations  suchas the United Nations  the Bretton Woods institutionsand the World Trade Organization. There is also needfor coherence in global policy-making. In the samevein  the management of the globalization processshould not be left to market forces alone but should beregulated in a way that gives it a humane face andreverses the marginalization of developing countries.In the area of world trade  we call for a levelplaying field in agenda setting and rule making in theWorld Trade Organization. We also need to see greatermarket-access opportunities for goods of exportinterest to developing countries in developed countrymarkets  as well as greater willingness to addressissues of commodity pricing. In addition  we call forthe removal of agricultural subsidies  which havedepressed the competitiveness of products fromdeveloping countries and inhibited their entry into thelucrative markets of the North. In the same vein  mydelegation also calls for the immediate cancellation ofthe debt of poor countries  so that debt-service funds which are crippling the development efforts ofdeveloping nations  can be used to improve thesituation of those countries.The special session on children  which was heldhere in New York in May of this year  did much tobring to the fore the need to address  in a meaningfulway  the rights and development needs of children with a view to enabling them to play their respectiveroles in society. The United Nations should continue toarticulate those needs and foster the creation of a worldfit for children.Since the attainment of independence in 1980 Zimbabwe has made tremendous progress in theprovision of schools and health-care facilities toimprove the quality of life of its children. Regrettably these gains were later to be reversed  as the BrettonWoods institutions demanded that we deprioritizeeducation  health and social welfare in our resourceallocations. Even without the support of thoseinstitutions  we have continued  within our limitedmeans  to place primary importance on thedevelopment of the Zimbabwean child and the welfareof the underprivileged  thereby raising the literacy ratein our society to 87 per cent.Zimbabwe and other countries in Southern Africaare grappling with the effects of the HIV/AIDSpandemic. Our own efforts at combating the scourgeare not enough  and they need to be augmented by thepositive contribution of those countries that have therequisite financial resources and technological know-how.We continue to call on the internationalcommunity and private companies to hasten theirefforts at finding an answer to this pandemic  which isravaging our populations and economies. Affordablebut effective drugs need to be made available  whilesupport should be given to care givers helping thosewho suffer from the disease. Special assistance shouldbe given to the growing number of children orphanedby the pandemic. We hope that the fund set up at lastyear's General Assembly special session on HIV/AIDSwill receive the urgent and meaningful support that itdeserves.As you are aware  my country and most parts ofSouthern Africa  are currently experiencing ahumanitarian crisis as a result of the drought that hitduring the main cereal-producing season earlier thisyear. We commend the efforts being made byinternational organizations and the donor community toprovide urgent food and non-food aid to ourcommunities. We particularly wish to mention theefforts of United Nations agencies in this regard. Wealso welcome additional assistance in programmes thatwill mitigate the effects of future droughts.Finally  my delegation is happy to inform you thatZimbabwe has concluded the fast-track land-redistribution programme that we introduced in July2000 in order to transfer land to the hitherto landlessblack majority. It will be recalled that we had to facevehement protestations  bad publicity andmisinformation from those who did not wish us well.27We remained resolute in the face of powerful forcesdetermined to preserve vestiges of colonial privilege.The primary objective of our agrarian reforms hasbeen to redress the colonial injustice perpetrated byBritain  whereby a minority of British settlers in 1890seized our land and acquired our natural resources butnever paid any compensation to our ancestors.By assuming its independence in 1980 Zimbabwe discarded the colonial yoke for all time and therefore  will never brook any interference in itsdomestic affairs by any foreign Power. I appeal to thisGeneral Assembly to convey to Britain and especiallyto its current Prime Minister  Mr. Tony Blair  thatZimbabwe ceased to be a British colony in 1980 afterPrince Charles  on behalf of the Government of theUnited Kingdom  gracefully lowered the British flag called the “Union Jack”. He should also be informedthat the people of Zimbabwe waged an armedrevolutionary struggle for their independence and standready to defend it in the same way. We want to be leftin peace to carry out our just reforms and developmentplans  as we peacefully interact and cooperate withother countries within the region  the African continentand the international community. We refuse to be anextension of Europe. We are Africans and shall remainso forever. I wish the 57th session of the GeneralAssembly every success."
