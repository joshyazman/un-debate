"1",34,"AFG",59,2004,"Nelson Mandela oncedescribed his countryís transition to democracy as along journey to freedom comprising many milestones each a realization of new opportunities for him and hisnation. We  the Afghan people  started our journey tostability and democracy almost three years ago. I amdelighted to report that  18 days from today  our peoplewill go to the polls for the first time to elect theirPresident  marking the most significant milestone inour journey.As the presidential elections will mark the end ofthe transitional period set forth in the historic BonnAgreement  I would like to outline some ofAfghanistanís achievements over the past three yearsand discuss our challenges.Much has changed in my country  but no changeis more visible than the confidence of the Afghanpeople in the future of our country. We have seen thatconfidence in the return of more than 3.5 millionrefugees who are now rebuilding their lives. We haveseen that confidence in the enthusiasm of families whoare sending their boys and girls to school  rebuildingtheir homes and setting up their businesses. And wehave seen that confidence in the enthusiasm of 10.5million Afghans who have registered to vote in theupcoming elections.Earlier this year  the Constitutional Loya Jirgaadopted an enlightened Constitution establishing ademocratic Islamic republic. It guarantees equal rightsand equal protection for all citizens ó men andwomen. The vision of the Constitutional Loya Jirga isbecoming a reality. Approximately 42 per cent of theregistered voters are women  and women will make upat least 25 per cent of our future parliament. OurConstitution also guarantees freedom of speech andfreedom of the press.During the past year  we enacted the election law established the necessary mechanism to organize andmanage elections and completed voter registration  andwe are now preparing to hold presidential andparliamentary elections. Thanks to the cooperation ofour two brotherly neighbours  Pakistan and Iran hundreds of thousands of Afghans still living in thosecountries will also participate in the election.2In partnership with the international community we have intensified our efforts to rebuild our nationalsecurity institutions. Today  there are 15 000 nationalarmy soldiers and nearly 30 000 national policeofficers providing security to our citizens. We aregrateful to the thousands of International SecurityAssistance Force and coalition troops that are assistingour security forces. We have also taken steps towardsdisarming  demobilizing and reintegrating privatemilitias. Nearly all of the heavy weapons have beencollected from the city of Kabul  and thousands offormer combatants have been disarmed in various partsof the country.We have continued the reconstruction of ourcountry. At the Berlin conference this year  theinternational community renewed its commitment torebuilding Afghanistan. The generous pledges that wereceived in Berlin will be committed to nationalreconstruction and development programmes that willcreate economic opportunities for our citizens and willfurther promote economic growth throughout theregion. Eradicating poverty and meeting theeducational and health needs of our citizens willcontinue to remain among our top priorities. We willcontinue to focus on building our roads to re-establishAfghanistan as the land bridge for transcontinentaltrade. Upon completion of Afghanistanís ring road every major Central Asian capital will be less than 32hours from the Persian Gulf and the port of Karachi.While our achievements are significant  wecontinue to face challenges. Terrorism remains one ofour main challenges. The remnants of terrorismcontinue to attack our citizens and to threaten oursecurity. As long as terrorism continues to exist in ourregion  neither Afghanistan nor our neighbours nor indeed  the rest of the world can be safe. Eliminatingthe remnants of terrorism in Afghanistan and in theregion requires not only continued support from theinternational community  but also strong and sincerecommitment from other countries in the region. To stopthe movement of terrorists across borders  the countriesin the region must cooperate closely.The cultivation and trafficking of narcotics isanother major challenge to Afghanistan and to the restof the world. Drug profits finance terrorism andundermine our efforts to build a healthy and legitimateeconomy. Afghanistan is fully committed toeliminating this menace. However  we cannot succeedwithout the strong partnership of the internationalcommunity.Poverty remains another serious challenge. Eventhough we have made considerable progress over thepast three years  we are still one of the poorestcountries. We still have the second-highest infant andmaternal mortality rates in the world  and we have oneof the highest illiteracy rates. Very few Afghans haveaccess to safe drinking water  and only 6 per cent of theAfghan population has reliable access to electricity.Our achievements have not come without a cost.During the elections for the Constitutional Loya Jirga terrorists did everything to disrupt the process including bombing an elementary school and killingmore than 20 children. During the registration for theelections  terrorists showed their desperation byintensifying their attacks. They bombed vehiclescarrying women registration workers  killed civilianswho carried registration cards and bombed religiousschools  killing children.Those attacks have not stopped our people frompassing one milestone after another. The valuable roleof the international community has been crucial to oursuccess. Nations from different continents withdifferent cultures and religions have come together tohelp rebuild Afghanistan. That is a clear example ofcooperation among civilizations. On behalf of theAfghan people  I thank all the nations that havesupported us with their troops and resources  especiallythe United States of America  Japan  Germany  theUnited Kingdom  Canada  Italy  Spain  France andTurkey. We are most grateful to the United Nations forthe commitment and engagement of United Nationsagencies and employees during the past three years. Weespecially appreciate the personal commitment anddedication of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan;his Deputy Special Representative  Mr. Jean Arnaud;and his Special Representative  Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi whose wisdom and leadership have guided usthroughout the journey.Afghanistan is on the road to recovery from thedevastation of more than two decades of war. Much hasbeen accomplished in the past three years. Yetestablishing a stable  democratic and prosperousAfghanistan requires sustained and collaborativeefforts by the Afghans  by our neighbours and by theinternational community. We  the Afghan people  willdo our share. Working together for a stable and3prosperous Afghanistan not only is a good example ofsuccessful international cooperation  but will alsocontribute to regional prosperity and global security."
"2",73,"AGO",59,2004,"I amoverwhelmed with a great sense of joy at seeingMr. Ping preside over the General Assembly at thisfifty-ninth session. My first words are thus to conveyto him  on behalf of my Government and on my ownbehalf  the most heartfelt congratulations upon hiselection. Our satisfaction springs from the great esteemin which the Angolan people hold your country andfrom the strong ties of friendship and fraternity thatunite us.I would also like to congratulate your predecessorfor the dynamic manner in which he carried out hismandate.53At a time when the world is confronting thehorrors of violence  poverty and hunger  the membersof the Assembly once again have the difficultresponsibility of assessing the implementation of theirdecisions and of seeking new solutions to problemsthat affect millions of human beings — solutions thatwill require a mechanism for international cooperation.The United Nations must remain the pivotalinstrument for States in dealing with new internationalchallenges to peace and security  such as terrorism;hunger; poverty; violations of human rights thatcontinue to deprive millions of human beings of theirfundamental freedoms; the degradation of theenvironment; organized transnational crime  includingdrug trafficking; and HIV/AIDS.The recent difficulties that the United Nations hasconfronted in dealing with situations that haveseriously affected international security have exposedthe limitations of its structure and its operation. TheUnited Nations system must be urgently reformed andadapted to the demands and challenges of the currentsituation  which is characterized by globalization.The main organs of the United Nations lack thebroad democratic character that they need in order toexpress the will of the majority of the Members of theOrganization. Both categories of membership of theSecurity Council should be expanded — on the basis ofequitable geographical representation — so as toreflect the new international order.In the past 50 years  humanity has madeimportant advances in the areas of science andtechnology  economic development  medicine andother fields  which have resulted in improved livingconditions and in an increase in the life expectancy ofvast segments of the world’s population  as well as inthe growth of the world’s material and even spiritualwealth.However  while some countries and continentshave shared in those gains  others continue to bemarginalized — overwhelmed by economic setbacksthat force a significant part of their population to livebelow the poverty line.The aspirations of such people to a world ofsocial justice and the full exercise of their economicand social rights  including the right to development continue to be unfulfilled. In fact  the ranks of the poorhave not stopped growing: since 1990  the number ofpoor people has been growing in sub-Saharan Africa Southern Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean.In the recent summit on hunger and poverty promoted by the President of Brazil  Lula da Silva world leaders highlighted the dramatic situation ofbillions of human beings living mainly in developingcountries who are suffering from hunger  malnutritionand diseases that are easily preventable.This is a reprehensible picture  and we musttherefore make the eradication of hunger and poverty apriority in our national policies and on theOrganization’s agenda. This dramatic situation couldrapidly be reversed by a greater commitment on thepart of the Governments of developing countries and astronger political will on the part of the richestcountries.Furthermore  restrictions on international freetrade have contributed to a deterioration in the livingconditions of people in countries subjected torestrictive economic measures  as is the case in Cuba.We believe that such measures constitute an assault onmoral and humanitarian principles.In spite of the efforts made by developing nationsto improve their economic performance and thewell-being of their populations  the practical results donot measure up to the needs of the developmentprocess. This is partly the result of the imposition ondeveloping countries of policies that do not take theirrealities into account.Some institutions and rich countries arepressuring poor countries to follow the steps taken byindustrialized countries during their economicdevelopment  alleging that developing countries willdevelop faster because of the benefits resulting fromthe implementation of policies that have in the pastyielded positive results.Such guidelines do not come close to meeting thedevelopment needs of poor countries. They fail toplace an emphasis on training institutions at the localand national level; those institutions should  indeed serve as levers for development.Wealthy nations have a moral responsibility tofoster a spirit of partnership  not of inequality anddependence  so as to contribute to the development ofthe less affluent countries and to the establishment ofinstitutions capable of sustaining their integration intothe global economy.54The existing economic disparities between thewealthy countries of the North and the developingcountries of the South is not the result of choice on thepart of the latter. The enrichment of the industrializedworld has been achieved at the expense of theimpoverishment of the Third World through therampant exploitation of its natural resources andworkforce and the imposition of a system ofoccupation and dominance.Today  our countries and peoples are stillsuffering as a result of those policies of exploitationand subjugation  which in some cases have beenworsened by internal conflicts that came about after theend of the period of foreign dominance.It appears to us at times that the internationalfinancial institutions and the rich countries deliberatelyminimize those facts. From our point of view  theextensive hesitation with respect to financial assistanceto developing countries is unjustified. Furthermore some of the imposed preconditions seem to be aresponse more to political interests rather than to therequirements of sustainable economic development.We had until recently called on this body and onthe international community to support the restorationof peace in Angola. That long-sought peace has finallyarrived and it has proved to be irreversible.The success of the peace process ushered in anew phase: the laying of the political groundwork forthe construction of a new society  one based on the ruleof law  tolerance  a market economy  and the existenceof a vibrant civil society. In addition to that politicalprocess  my Government is engaged in economicreform  which is a contributing factor to economic andsocial stability. Were it not for the tremendous simultaneous challenges that we have had to face  thatprocess could have been faster.So far  the Angolan Government has beentackling alone the task of national reconstruction. Thattask involves the rehabilitation of social and productiveinfrastructures  which were almost totally destroyed bythe armed conflict; the social reintegration of nearly100 000 former combatants and their families; theresettlement of more than 4 million internally displacedpersons and more than 400 000 refugees; and a far-reaching effort to reduce the poverty that afflicts mostof the population. This very difficult task can besuccessful only with the full participation of theinternational community.The reservations expressed by certaininternational donors in terms of providing assistance toAngola — overlooking the fact that the internalconflict was quite lengthy and destructive  that itabsorbed a large part of the country’s financial  humanand materials resources  and that it disrupted thecountry — can be justified only by a lack of politicalwill.The reconstruction of Angola urgently requirespartnerships and substantial support comparable to theassistance given to other countries in post-conflictsituations.As a country that is rejoicing in the peace andfreedom for which it fought for 40 years  Angola isconcerned with the instability in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  a country that shares anextensive land border with Angola  and with which wehave fraternal ties. We were particularly shocked bythe massacres of civilians in Gatumba. Theperpetrators of that heinous act  who provoked a newescalation of violence in order to make the peaceprocess unworkable  must be held judiciallyaccountable. That act makes clear  inter alia  that despite the significant efforts made in the context ofthe peace process in the Democratic Republic of theCongo  the situation is still quite fragile.The international community  particularly theSecurity Council and the African Union  must devotespecial and ongoing attention to this issue in order toavoid a collapse of the process.In that context  subregional organizations  thecountries of the region and other bodies involved in thepursuit of lasting peace in that country must cooperate with a view to encouraging the Congolese parties tomeet their commitments under the transitional process.It is crucial that all the countries neighbouring theDemocratic Republic of the Congo reiterate theircommitment to continue to respect the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of the country and not to interferein its internal affairs.The Transitional Government of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo needs the support of theinternational community. My Government is willing  tothe extent of its ability  to supply the necessaryassistance in the process of the consolidation of peaceand stability in that country.55The crisis in Darfur is a thorn in the internationaljuridical conscience. Angola supports the decision ofthe Secretary-General to authorize an investigation. Wehope that the authorities of the Sudan will fullycooperate with the African Union and the SecurityCouncil in their efforts to help bring peace to thepeople of that region. We believe that there now existsa solid basis for resolving that conflict.Having in the past been a victim of terrorism Angola cannot be indifferent to acts of terrorism wherever they may happen. The acts of terrorism wehave witnessed in recent times  and the vile and cruelform they have taken  should not discourage the effortsthat the international community has been making toroot out their perpetrators  but should instead increaseits determination to isolate terrorist groups and stymietheir efforts.We believe  however  that we should reflectfurther on ways to prevent and combat terrorism. Havethe methods used to date been effective in eradicatingterrorism? Is the current system of collective securitycapable of coping with the aggressiveness of theterrorists? Would responses to terrorism based on themultilateral efforts of the United Nations be lesseffective?"
"3",120,"ALB",59,2004,"It is my special pleasure toaddress the fifty-ninth session of the General Assemblyof the United Nations. This universal forum hasenabled the peoples of the world to coordinate andharmonize their efforts in preserving peace andsecurity  in achieving prosperity and upholding thevalues of human civilization.I would like to congratulate you  Mr. President on being elected to preside over this august body andto express my confidence in your successfulleadership.I would also like  on behalf of Albania  to conveyto the Secretary-General our highest appreciation forhis leading contribution to the fulfilment of thehistorical mission of the United Nations and to theaspirations of our peoples for a better world in whichonly peace  democracy and economic prosperity reign.This session of the General Assembly takes placein a milestone year for Europe. Only a few months ago a historic event vitalized the dream of a more unitedand stronger Europe. Ten European countries  sharing acommon aspiration for integration  were admitted intothe European Union.The Albanian Government and society areengaged in an all-round European integration process and they are carrying out necessary reforms with thenecessary political will and drive.Albania is working to strengthen the democraticinstitutions and capacities of its central and localgovernment with a view to bringing its legislation andconditions into line with European Union standards progressively achieving concrete and measurableresults  as previously defined.Determined to make our contribution to regionaland global security  the Albanian Governmentconsiders the country's integration into NATO to beone of its major objectives. The NATO IstanbulSummit last June commended the progress made by mycountry in this regard and encouraged the deepening ofreforms. It welcomed Albania's contribution toregional stability and cooperation and committed toassess our further progress at the next NATO summit which would hopefully mark the start of negotiationsfor our full membership in the alliance. We believe thatthe commitments set up in the framework of theAdriatic Charter are also contributing to meet NATO38standards  to the benefit of regional stability andsecurity.We remain truly convinced that the respect andprotection of human rights and freedoms are the mainpillars of a pluralist democratic society. TheGovernment of the Republic of Albania will continueto constantly demonstrate its commitment to a fullimplementation of the standards enshrined in theUnited Nations and Council of Europe conventions  aswell as the relevant documents of regionalorganizations  such as the Organization for Securityand Cooperation in Europe  in which we are playing avery active role. We will continue to do so in the futureas well. By adopting contemporary legislation and bybecoming a party to other recently adoptedinternational instruments on human rights  Albania hasassociated itself with countries that are enforcing anumber of national strategies and programmes focusingon specific population groups  especially women children  persons in need and minorities  among others.In recent years  the Albanian Government hasstarted to periodically submit reports to the committeesof the six main United Nations human rights treatiesand is taking their recommendations into seriousconsideration. It is our belief that these internationalmechanisms play a significant and important role asguardians of the common human values we havetogether adopted.Albania  as one of the 191 signatory countries ofthe Millennium Declaration  remains fully committedto implementation of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals  which have been properly reflected in a nationalstrategy for social and economic development. Thepattern of our sustained economic growth  which is at 6to 7 per cent for the seventh consecutive year  is a goodsupport base for the whole society to maintain higherstandards of respect for human rights and to fightpoverty and crime. I would like to take this opportunityto thank the United Nations specialized agencies fortheir valuable assistance in support of theimplementation of these objectives nationwide and ona central and local level.The Albanian Government is pleased to note thatan ever-healthier climate of confidence and relations ofbilateral and multilateral cooperation are prevailing inthe South-Eastern European region. The countries ofthe region are fully engaged in a process that will leadus clearly toward Euro-Atlantic integration and at thesame time continually remove us from the extremisttendencies that caused a number of conflicts in the lastdecade. The regional policy of my Government isguided by the motto: 'the more integrated in theregion  the more integrated in Europe.' Inimplementing this policy  Albania is cooperating asnever before with all the countries of the region bymaking borders less relevant  opening up to oneregional market the implementation of free tradeagreements and free movement corridors  andstimulating foreign direct investment. We areespecially cooperating with the common fight againstorganized crime and all kinds of illegal trafficking. Inthe meantime  Albania is reinforcing its bordermanagement and control  guided by the EuropeanUnion and NATO standards.My country will hold general parliamentaryelections by the middle of next year. We are committedto doing all that is required to ensure that the electionprocess is fully compatible with international standardsfor free and fair elections. To that end  we arecommitted to continuing to work with relevantspecialized institutions on elections by fullyimplementing especially OSCE/Office for DemocraticInstitutions and Human Rights (ODIHR)recommendations. For us  the process and standardsare more important than the results of the elections.In the context of strengthening regionalcooperation  my country is committed to a moreenhanced partnership with all regional organizationsand initiatives that serve the promotion of goodneighbourly relations; the strengthening of regionalpeace  security and stability; ensuring political supportfor integration into Euro-Atlantic structures  andattracting financing for national and regional projectsin priority fields such as energy  transportation andtelecommunications.On its path towards European integration  theSouth-East European region is still facing pendingchallenges  such as the future of Kosovo. Albaniagreatly appreciates the recent democratic andintegration developments in Kosovo  thanks to theefforts of the respective peoples and the partnership ofits self-governing institutions with the United NationsInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).Allow me at this point to congratulate Mr. SorenJessen-Petersen  Special Representative for Kosovo ofthe United Nations Secretary-General  in assuming thisvery important duty.39The Albanian Government shares the view thatthe time has come for a rapid and coherentimplementation of the policy of standards of amultiethnic democracy and European status forKosovo. This would be the key to the solution of anumber of other issues. We truly hope that the questionof the final status of Kosovo will reach a final solutionsoon  for the sake of the people of Kosovo and for theenhancement of the Europeanization process of thewhole region.In the meantime  we support all efforts to build ademocratic and multicultural society in Kosovo that isgoverned by the rule of law  ethnic and religioustolerance and cohabitation. Particularly helpful in thisregard would be the further energizing of UNMIKístransfer of authority to the legitimate institutions ofKosovo that are already being anchored to Europeanintegration agendas.We believe that in the upcoming Octoberparliamentary elections  the Albanian and other ethniccommunities of Kosovo will demonstrate their bestvalues  taking a major step toward the consolidation ofmultiethnic democracy in the region. We also hope thatthe Serbian minority in Kosovo will assume itsresponsibilities and  through a free vote  make theircontribution to the European future of Kosovo. Theirparticipation in all levels of the democratic institutionsof Kosovo would further contribute to theconsolidation of peace  stability and the Europeanperspective in the whole region.My Government supports a stimulation of directdialogue between Pristina and Belgrade  both onpolitical and technical issues. This is fundamental inresolving the pending problems and is in accordancewith the spirit of regional and European integration.The tragic terrorist attack one year ago inBaghdad  which took the lives of 22 people  includingUnited Nations Under-Secretary-General Sergio Vieirade Mello  is still fresh in our memories. Such hideousand punishable acts  which continued in the followingdays and months there and in other countries of theworld  such as Turkey  Spain  Russia  Indonesia andothers  show that terrorism is today the biggest threatto international peace and security  to stability and tothe values of world democracy and civilization.In the global effort to combat terrorism  ourcountries have already understood that  first of all  itcannot be identified with one people  one religion  onerace or only certain groups of society. We believe thatthe fight against terrorism will only be successful if wejoin efforts. In that context  we support thestrengthening of international cooperation amongStates and international organizations  in which theUnited Nations has an irreplaceable role.The Albanian Government has been consistentlycommitted to making its contribution as an activemember of the international coalition against terrorism.We have peacekeeping troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.We have signed  ratified and now are implementing 12United Nations conventions and protocols againstterrorism. We are doing the same with the relevantresolutions of the Security Council  cooperating withand presenting regular reports to the Council. TheAlbanian Government salutes the decision of theSecurity Council to play a more active role in the fightagainst threats stemming from the possession andtrafficking of weapons of mass destruction. We supportSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004).Albania has  on the other hand  taken allmeasures for the implementation of the Code ofConduct on the Safety and Security of RadioactiveSources of the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA)  convinced that this international instrument isextremely important to preventing threats stemmingfrom the misuse of radioactive materials. Albania hasalready taken the decision and will soon sign theProtocol Additional to the Safeguards Agreement ofthe IAEA. This year  Albania also joined theProliferation Security Initiative  with its respectivecommitments that will create benefits for all.Peace and stability have not been fullyestablished in certain regions of the world. The UnitedNations and the Security Council are the authoritiesmandated by the Charter to preserve peace and securityglobally. It is only natural that crisis-solving solutionsand initiatives in such hot spots around the globe asIraq  the Middle East  Afghanistan  Sudan and so onremain high on their agenda. We believe that a moreactive engagement of the international community isrequired in finding the most suitable and lastingsolutions for those crisis situations  as is the furtherenhancement of the role and effectiveness of theUnited Nations structures.In that regard  the Albanian Governmentwelcomed the unanimous adoption of Security Councilresolution 1546 (2004) of 8 June on Iraq  approving the40provisional Government of Iraq and transferring to itauthority and sovereignty  the independence andterritorial integrity of Iraq  Iraqi Government control ofthe armed forces and  in particular  the holding ofdemocratic elections in early 2005. The progress madein Iraq is due to the cooperation between the IraqiGovernment forces and those of the Coalition. Wewould wish  however  to see a further lowering oftensions and a full stop to violence. We would wish forincreased security  more stability and the establishmentof a democratic society.That is why we strongly condemn the strategy ofviolence and hostage-taking to achieve political goals sometimes cloaked under a religious veil  and we joinour voice to those of all the international actors thathave called for an immediate stop to those acts. TheAlbanian Government supports the efforts of theUnited Nations to provide the assistance necessary tobuild national democratic institutions in Iraq and to theholding of free and democratic elections early nextyear.My Government also follows with great concernthe developments in the Middle East. Like the wholeinternational community  we hope to see an end put tothe deterioration of the situation in the occupiedPalestinian territories  where violence towards thecivilian population is increasingly claiming innocentlives  especially those of women and children. On theother hand  we condemn any terrorist act against thecivilian population  irrespective of whose name it iscommitted in.The Albanian Government strongly believes thatpeace can and should be achieved only throughdialogue and negotiation. We are convinced that theSecurity Council  the Quartet and the internationalcommunity have the authority and the capacity toestablish a stable peace in Palestine and throughout theMiddle East based on the Security Councilísresolutions and the road map. The internationalcommunity should continue to monitor closely theimplementation of the road map in order to avoid anydeviation from or change  misinterpretation or blockingof it by the parties to the conflict.Current developments and realities in theinternational arena  and the acute problems andchallenges we are all facing ó such as preservingpeace and security  facing the threats and dangers ofterrorism  the fight against poverty and fatal diseases the effects of globalization and environmentaldegradation ó have increasingly sharpened the need torevitalize our Organization. The Albanian Governmentis fully supportive of the efforts of the Secretary-General to reform the Organization  in particular theinitiatives taken regarding the reform of the SecurityCouncil. We join with the voices that call for a strongerUnited Nations and for more efficient organs andmechanisms engaged in monitoring the implementationof obligations by United Nations Member States  inparticular those concerning global security.We therefore think that the time has come to havea more representative  more transparent and moreflexible Security Council that could better reflectcurrent realities. Its enlargement with permanent andnon-permanent members would increase thepossibilities for all States Members of the UnitedNations to contribute to the preservation ofinternational peace and stability. It would be asignificant step towards the completion of UnitedNations reform.My country is willing to contribute further to theactivities of the United Nations  especially in theglobal and regional agendas related to sustainableeconomic and social development and the protection offundamental freedoms and human rights universally.To that end  Albania has modestly presented for thefirst time its candidacy to become a member of theEconomic and Social Council for the period2005-2007. We hope we shall succeed.A few weeks ago  the whole world witnessed thesuccessful conclusion of the Olympic Games inAthens. Gathered around the Olympic torch  sportsmenand women demonstrated how closely nations canstand with one another and how we can get rid ofhatred and conflict from our midst. Let the symbol ofOlympic peace and fraternity help us to build a better more secure world for us and for generations to come."
"4",143,"AND",59,2004,"A decade agoI was elected the Head of Government of my country.It was 1994  a time of hope for the world and for theOrganization of the United Nations. The collapse of thecommunist system and the iron curtain and theappearance of new democracies in the world  combinedwith a positive economic outlook enabled us toimagine a better future for humankind in the twenty-first century.Ten years later  we are living with considerableconcern in a world that is becoming more and moreviolent  in which terrorist attacks are met with amilitary response and those military responses seem togenerate new terrorist attacks. It would seem that weare caught up in a terrible settling of scores and in aspiral of hate  fanaticism and senseless bloodshed.Every day  the media shows images of innocent peopleand soldiers losing their lives in those conflicts. Thestakes continue to rise  yet the cause of world peaceseems increasingly vulnerable. The almostinstantaneous arrival in every home of images of themost dramatic events taking place everywhere is evenbecoming banal.The privilege of being able to come so manytimes to the Assembly on behalf of my country hasproduced in me states of mind that have gone frominitial curiosity and the wish to know and learn to amuch more sceptical phase  by way of periods in whichlarge question marks were placed on the role we are allplaying in this game.We want to be positive and optimistic and not tobetray the heritage of peace  harmony and openwelcome that are the essence of the life of theAndorrans  both women and men. But it must beadmitted that it is becoming more and more difficult tothink in that way and to believe that the principles thatinspired  for example  the founding of the UnitedStates of America  can still prevail.That is because the notion of pre-emptive war hasnow shaken us all. The principle of attacking beforeone is attacked is no new invention. But it had seemedto be a tribal memory or a type of behaviour belongingto other  none too remote times in the history of Europeitself.The big questions are: what justifies a pre-emptive attack? Which country or countries pose asufficient threat to allow taking such a risk? Whyattack one country and not another  perhaps equallydangerous one? Are the sufferings of some peoplemore meaningful than the sufferings of others  andconsequently more deserving of action? Should theconventions of international law be cast aside by36Members of the United Nations  as they are by lawlessterrorists?What I would like to do today is reflect on thethings we can learn from the past that can guide ustowards a more promising and safer future.For countries with a deep respect and admirationfor the history of freedom of the United States — andAndorra counts itself among those countries — it is asource of consternation to note that the doctrine of pre-emptive attack has generated a level of distrust amongGovernments and peoples. After the worldwideoutpouring of sympathy following the terrorist attackson New York and Washington  that changed perceptionis profoundly troubling.Neither can anyone claim that sympathy isenough. Worldwide sympathy was the reaction to theattacks on New York and Washington. We  the peopleof Andorra  were very directly affected by the attacksin Madrid six months ago. Very recently  Russia hasbeen added to the list of disasters. But sympathy alonecannot break the cycle of fear and violence.We need to address the causes of terrorism andcomprehend the forces that give it power in order torespond together in compliance with the rule of law.Tomorrow  my country will deposit instruments ofratification for four conventions against terrorism  andthe rest are scheduled to be ratified in the coming year.Mr. Kazykhanov (Kazakhstan)  Vice-President took the Chair.We cannot allow terrorism to unbind the rule oflaw  since that would mean undoing the tissue ofcivilized behaviour  which serves as a safety net inmodern culture. Instead of isolating one nation fromanother  instead of moralizing and self-serving politicalposturing  instead of giving in to fear  we mustrecognize that our common vulnerability goes hand inhand with a humanity that we also share.Helping every member of the internationalcommunity to realize that what happens to others canalso happen to us creates a basis for tolerance andunderstanding. How much stronger we  all thecountries represented at the United Nations  couldbecome in the fight against terrorism if we truly actedtogether. A Security Council strengthened by acommon will to root out terrorism could do much morethan individual actions supported by a fewGovernments.We must give back to the United Nations its senseof determination and help it to help us all in thecrucially important fight against terrorism. I call inparticular on the States that are permanent members ofthe Security Council to think long and hard about whatthey can achieve together  with the support of all otherUnited Nations Member States  to preserveinternational order and models of civilized behaviour which this Organization represents and which it hastaken humankind so many millenniums of sufferingand progress to achieve.In this context  Andorra would support anincrease — up to 24 — in the number of members ofthe Security Council so as to guarantee a more accuraterepresentation of the reality of today’s world in thatimportant decision-making body.I believe that the energy that feeds the cycle ofviolence is the result of the abstractions behind whichwe hide — abstractions of nation  religion or race. Wehide our vulnerability behind a kind of rigid certaintyor moral righteousness. Ignorance and theunwillingness to recognize differences give rise toxenophobia and racism.There is not much use in wondering now if theresults would have been different  and the dangersfacing us today less severe  if different policies hadbeen applied after the criminal and unforgivableattacks of 11 September 2001; if the peace process inIsrael and Palestine had been more successful; or if wein the United Nations had been able to play a differentrole. Granted  our response  as the United Nations  toother international crises has been imperfect  and weare constantly striving to rectify the way in which weapproach such issues. But the results have beeninvaluable. Our efforts averted worse bloodbaths greater harm to the oppressed and ever more extremetrauma and despair.What good is this Organization if we lack thewisdom and moral strength to attempt to reconcile ourfellow nations? How could we continue to hope forpeace and justice in the world if the United Nationsceased to press forward with its mission?Andorra has never been a wealthy country though its inhabitants have always been free. In thisrespect  we have a privileged history. Other nationshave endured greater privations and fratricidal wars have lost customs and traditions and have had itscitizens flee into exile.37Conscious of the moral debt which we owe toothers  three years ago we proposed to increase ourdevelopment assistance to 0.7 per cent of our budgetfor next year. Although that represents a great effort forus  as a small country  I am happy to inform theAssembly that that commitment will be honoured. I amalso sure that my successor as head of Government willcontinue to increase Andorra’s contribution to theobjectives of development until we reach 0.7 per centof gross domestic product. We will also become amember of the Food and Agriculture Organization ofthe United Nations and help to make its worthymission a reality.We live in a world of limited resources andopportunities. Competition for them is increasing withthe growth of globalization. The worst outcome of theinevitable future competition would be increasinglyviolent demands on the part of one nation or another.Yet the essential issues facing us are not restricted tojust one part of the world; nor can they be defined interms of the advantages or interests of a single nation.Preserving the environment and maintaining a strongglobal economy  dignified standards of living and safeand peaceful political relationships all require aconcerted effort.The task will not be easy. It will require all thecourage  energy  diplomatic talent and communicationskills that we can bring to bear. Our joint task hasnever been as important as in the coming year.Yesterday  I listened carefully to the words of theSecretary-General  who set a very high standard for allin his opening speech. I would like sincerely tocongratulate the Secretary-General for the courage ofhis words. I have heard many impressive speeches inthis Hall over the past 10 years. The Secretary-General’s statement yesterday was the best  by far  ofall of them.Although Andorra joined the United Nations just10 years ago  our country is not a new one. Quite thecontrary — the Principality of Andorra is one of theoldest and most peaceful nations in the world. Ourfrontiers have not changed for centuries  and we havepractised parliamentary democracy for over half of thattime. In fact  we have had uninterrupted peace since1278.In the thirteenth century  during the violent periodof the Cathar heresies  which created upheaval in ourpart of the world  two powerful lords — the Count ofFoix in the north and the Bishop of Urgell in thesouth — managed to overcome religious and politicaldifferences to negotiate an agreement which made theAndorran State possible. Through the 1993constitution  we keep their successors — the Presidentof the French Republic and the Bishop of Urgell — asour heads of State in a personal  joint and indivisiblemanner. The continued existence of Andorra over thecenturies has  indeed  been the result of a skilful andconstant will to negotiate between our people and theirpowerful neighbours.The democratic process which began with thesetting up of the Council of the Land in 1419 wasessential for our survival as a free community.Although conflicts have also threatened Andorraduring its history  mutual understanding has protectedus better than have the high peaks of the mountainswhich surround us or the rigorous winters whichisolate us from the outside world for weeks and weeksat a time. When I read Andorran documents from pastcenturies  I recognize how deeply ideas ofindependence and respect for others have guaranteedour well-being and our security.Given the bloody course of European historyduring previous millenniums  we hold this as aremarkable accomplishment. We have never had anarmy  nor have we produced one single offensiveweapon of any type. Our only weapon has been thewisdom and prudence of our forebears  who had thegood sense to keep out of all neighbouring conflicts.That good sense has been inherited by the newgenerations of young Andorrans — women and menwho are very well prepared for the world of today open to knowledge of new technology and full oflegitimate pride in being members of a small State inwhich they have every chance of being the main agentsof their future  but who are  at the same time perplexed by the growth of new religious fanaticismand exclusiveness and by the return of old fanaticisms which we had considered forgotten.At this  the dawn of a new era  we must pass onto them the trust which we have placed in the UnitedNations and in the supremacy of law over force. Thisour fathers taught us  and this our children must learnif they are to be worthy members of humankind."
"5",188,"ARE",59,2004,"Mr. President  on behalf of the United ArabEmirates  it gives me great pleasure to begin mystatement by congratulating you  Sir  and your friendlycountry  the Gabonese Republic  on your election asPresident of the fifty-ninth session of this Assembly.Given your political skills and experience  we areconfident that you will competently and successfullylead our deliberations on pressing global and regionalissues. We wish you every success in your endeavours.On this occasion  I wish to pay tribute to yourpredecessor  Mr. Julian Robert Hunte  for his wise andskilful management of the activities of the previoussession. It also gives me pleasure to reiterate ourappreciation and gratitude to Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary-General of the United Nations  for hisconsistent efforts to strengthen the leading role of theUnited Nations  especially in resolving the politicalconflicts and economic crises that continue to plagueour world.Notwithstanding the achievements of the lastcentury and their positive impact on the principles ofliberalization  globalization and freedom  recentevents  especially during the last few years  haveincluded  violations of human rights  the outbreak ofterrorist attacks and the eruption of violence andconflicts. These events have  to a great extent  limitedpeoples’ ability to reap the benefits of most of theseachievements. Instead of directing efforts towardssolving the problems related to poverty  the spread ofepidemics  improving sustainable economic environmental and social development mechanismsand strengthening international relations — as outlinedin the Millennium Declaration — the world had todevote a great part of its efforts to further exploringcoordinated measures for combating these gravethreats  which have shaken the underpinnings ofinternational peace and security.Previous experience has shown that regional andinternational multilateral initiatives built on principlesof partnership  justice  transparency and equalityamong peoples and States can address and containglobal challenges. Therefore  we are convinced thatcarrying out the reform needed in the existingstructures of international relations  especially in theUnited Nations system  has become an importantpriority so that its principal organs — the SecurityCouncil  the General Assembly and the Economic andSocial Council — can revitalize their activities andfulfil their responsibilities in terms of maintaininginternational peace and security.Commitment by all countries and governments todischarge their responsibilities in accordance with theprinciples of international law is a key condition forenforcing the rule of law and avoiding potentialeconomic  environmental and security problems.Therefore  the United Arab Emirates  as a Member ofthe United Nations  is committed to meet itsobligations  especially those related to promotingfriendly relations with neighbouring countries cooperation in the security and economic fields andrespect for the sovereignty  national unity andterritorial integrity and the right to self-determinationof all countries.Proceeding from its belief in the value ofdialogue  peaceful negotiations and legal arbitration insettling conflicts and disputes among countries  theUnited Arab Emirates has pursued a firm and peacefulpolicy regarding the question of the occupation by theIslamic Republic of Iran of our three islands: GreaterTunb  Lesser Tunb and Abou Moussa. Theinternational community is now aware of the legal historical and political grounds of this case  as well asall the initiatives  contacts and constant efforts by mycountry at various levels to find a peaceful solution tothis question.The United Arab Emirates is perplexed at theposition of Iran and its constant rejection of allpeaceful initiatives and endeavours by the memberStates of the Gulf Cooperation Council to find apeaceful solution to this important issue. Therefore  theUnited Arab Emirates calls upon the internationalcommunity to urge Iran either to clarify its intentionstowards the United Arab Emirates by enteringunconditionally into serious bilateral negotiationswhich ensure restoration of the three occupied islands their continental shelves and regional airspace andtheir economic zones to the full sovereignty andterritorial unity of the United Arab Emirates  or toaccept referral of this case to the International Court ofJustice for arbitration.44The regrettable developments taking place on thesecurity front in the Arabian Gulf region have createdserious challenges to the international community dueto the sensitive nature of this region and the emergenceof new forms of threats  which include terrorist acts kidnappings and arbitrary killing of hundreds ofinnocent people in various areas in Iraq and othercountries. In this context  the United Arab Emiratesexpresses its strong condemnation of all acts ofviolence in Iraq  which if not contained will lead to anescalation of tension and instability in the entireregion  as well as the world. We also express oursupport to the legitimate endeavours of the Iraqi peopleand their interim Government to completearrangements for a peaceful transition of authority assoon as possible  to exercise their inalienable right todecide their political future and internal affairs  controltheir natural resources  rebuild their nationalinstitutions and maintain security on their borders.We also attach great importance to supportinginternational and regional efforts to help the Iraqipeople to rehabilitate their destroyed institutions  andto the unity and solidarity of the Iraqi people especiallyduring this critical stage  in order to enable them tostart a new phase in which security  stability  good-neighbourly relations and cooperation with allcountries of the world prevail.The United Arab Emirates reiterates its strongcondemnation of all acts of terrorism in the Gulfregion  especially in the fraternal Kingdom of SaudiArabia and other areas where a number of residentialareas were targets of horrific terrorist attacks. TheUnited Arab Emirates declares its full support for thecontinuing efforts and measures taken by thesecountries to combat those inadmissible acts  includingthose by the Government of the Kingdom of SaudiArabia to defeat those criminal terrorist attempts insideSaudi territory.The United Arab Emirates believes thatsettlement of the Middle East question cannot beachieved with the position of a de facto situation ofoccupation  settlement  and siege of the Palestinianpeople  who are now facing the worst humanitariancrisis in their history because of the acts of arbitrarykilling  destruction  starvation and unjustified massdetentions by the Israeli authorities. The United ArabEmirates affirms that continuation of the Israeliaggression will inevitably lead to more violence anddeterioration in the security situation.We therefore recall the historical  political andlegal responsibility of the United Nations and theQuartet  which is now responsible for finding asettlement of the Palestinian question through obligingIsrael  the occupying Power  to unconditionally complywith the terms of the road map and other relevantinternational resolutions  especially those issued by theInternational Court of Justice and the GeneralAssembly that call for dismantling the racist separationwall in the West Bank  as it is considered illegal andnull and void.We also affirm that establishment of acomprehensive  just and lasting peace in the regiondepends on the ability of the international communityto end Israel’s intransigence  on revitalization of thepeace process and on full Israeli withdrawal from allPalestinian and other Arab territories occupied since1967  including East Jerusalem  the Syrian Golan andthe Shab’a farms. It depends also on the establishmentof a Palestinian State with its capital at Al-Quds al-Sharif  pursuant to the relevant internationalresolutions and the fundamentals of the existing Arabpeace initiative  which is based on the principle of landfor peace. In that context  we also affirm theimportance of respecting the wishes of the Lebanesepeople and of not interfering in its internal affairs.Attaining and maintaining balance in the securitysituation in the Middle East and the Gulf region istoday a matter of high priority. It requires acomprehensive  non-discriminatory  confidence-building policy that will lead to the elimination of allexisting arsenals of weapons of mass destruction aspart of an international process of non-proliferation.Here  we look forward to the outcome of the recentvisit of the Director General of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to a number ofcountries in the region  which was aimed at convincingtheir Governments to relinquish the nuclear arsenalsthat pose a threat to neighbouring countries.In that connection  we renew our appeal to theinternational community to take all necessary measuresto compel the Israeli Government to accede to theTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) and to subject all its nuclear facilities to theIAEA international safeguards system  so that a zonefree of weapons of mass destruction can be establishedin the Arabian Gulf and the Middle East regions.45Reports of the Secretary-General on the worldeconomic and social situation reveal that almost abillion people lack food  drinking water  jobopportunities  housing and educational  health andsocial services. The United Arab Emirates has a goodrecord of providing development and relief assistanceto many countries  and we believe that the internationalcommunity should address those challenges as itscommon responsibility  requiring complete fulfilmentof the commitments and pledges made by developednations at United Nations conferences and summits onsustainable development and on financing fordevelopment. Those pledges relate to increasingassistance to developing countries  reschedulingforeign debt  easing restrictions on foreign trade increasing foreign investment and providing access tomodern technologies for peaceful purposes. That wouldenable developing countries to share equally in thebenefits of globalization.Further  we welcome current efforts to set up aglobal fund to end poverty by 2015. Here  we affirmthat there must be progress in negotiations on North-South cooperation and on coordination among regionaland international organizations if we are to put an endto the negative effects of repeated financial andeconomic crises and ensure steady assistance flows andthe stability of commodity markets. Policies andchoices to liberalize world trade and the worldeconomy must be reviewed from a developmentperspective  taking into account the concerns and needsof small countries and developing countries  and theirright to attain development and participate in theinternational decision-making process. This wouldenable their economies to avoid stagnation andmarginalization  and would ensure the implementationof national programmes to diversify nationalproduction  develop human resources and reduce levelsof unemployment  poverty and disease.We hope that our deliberations at this session willhave a positive outcome that will enhance ourperception of our common causes and buttress our jointefforts to create a prosperous world based on the ruleof law and justice  a world in which tolerance  well-being and progress prevail."
"6",235,"ARG",59,2004,"I shouldlike at the outset to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-ninth session and to commend the outgoingPresident  Mr. Julian Hunte  for his work. I should alsolike to express once again our appreciation for theefforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  topromote peace and multilateralism.We have come from the South to renew ourresolve to participate actively in United Nations effortsto promote peace  economic development and theeradication of hunger and poverty. My country isgrateful for the endorsement of the Group of LatinAmerican and Caribbean States to occupy a seat on theSecurity Council for that regional Group as a non-permanent member during the period 2005-2006.There  the Republic of Argentina will reaffirm itswillingness to promote consensus aimed atstrengthening international law and international peaceand security. Those are values that we associate withrepresentative democracy  respect for human rights  afair global trade system  a better distribution of thebenefits of globalization and the democratization ofdecision-making in international organizations.The United Nations must strengthen itself andmove forward in the establishment of valid rules andprocedures to guarantee international peace andsecurity.The report of the High-Level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change could play a key role in thisarea. Its proposals should be properly discussed andagreed upon in order to implement concrete decisionsthat reflect and meet the different perspectives andinterests of all Member States.We are convinced that there is no acceptablealternative to multilateral action. Only throughcollective debate and consensus could a majority ofcountries ensure genuine action. The only legitimacyfor the use of force must come from the decisions ofthe Security Council. Because of this  we supportefforts to provide the Council with greatertransparency  and with the participation of theinternational community in its decisions  without thismeaning increasing the existing privileges orestablishing new categories.27The Council's action should be innovative andexpress the political will of the internationalcommunity  all the while recognizing the fact that theprimary responsibility in avoiding conflicts will alwaysrest with the parties involved.We firmly condemn the acts of internationalterrorism and related crimes that have so deeplymarked the memory of the people of Argentina and ofother nations of the world  making it the maximumpriority. In this war against terrorism  we require theactive participation and cooperation of the entireinternational community  based on respect forinternational law.There is a necessary link between respect forhuman rights and the fight against terrorism. And wemust preserve the balance between necessary defenceand respect for human rights. In order to successfullytackle terrorism  we must ensure legitimacy by havingthe support of international public opinion. Accordingto this logic  the fight transcends the purely militaryand predominantly unilateral reaction.In our view  modern threats to peace come fromboth the criminal action of terrorism and theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction  frommassive human rights violations and the absence ofdemocratic political participation. But stability andsecurity are also affected by hunger and extremepoverty  by social exclusion  by ignorance andilliteracy  by the spread of disease and epidemics andby irreversible damage to the environment.As a result  understanding that peace anddevelopment mutually reinforce each other  we mustwork in a multilateral framework that promotesnational and international economic systems based onthe principles of justice  equity  democracy participation  transparency  responsibility and socialinclusion. Our commitment to peace and to thestrengthening of democracy in the world requiresdecisive action  which makes it possible to combathunger  illiteracy and disease. These phenomenaweaken peopleís autonomy and dignity and make itdifficult for them to exercise their full rights ascitizens.In June 2005  the Third Inter-American Meetingof Ministers of Health and the Environment  which weare preparing  will work on the assessment of ourcompliance with the Millennium Development Goals inthe region and will submit its conclusions to theSummit of Heads of State of the Americas  which willtake place in Argentina in November 2005.We know that the problems that are linked toinequality and poverty cannot be resolved with socialpolicies that are based purely on assistance. Even whenplans and programmes providing assistance are anecessary resource  we should avoid the growth ofsocieties that are divided between those who work andthose who receive assistance. In this framework  it isimportant for work to feature prominently on theinternational agenda  linked to freedom  justice security and protection  taking into account the factthat it is the principal means of social integration.Economic growth is a necessary prerequisite  butit alone is not enough to remedy the high rates ofunemployment  lack of job security and work in theinformal sector besetting our societies. In the recentpast  many of our countries we have experiencedperiods of high growth with low rates of job creation high concentrations of income and a significantincrease in poverty. It is clear evidence of theerroneous nature of the myth that economic growth hastrickle-down effects. Accordingly  it is important for usto pursue active policies that stimulate business andproductive investment and give priority to thegeneration of decent jobs  within a new model thatendows economic change with a strong ethicalcomponent. Decent jobs are a more effectiveinstrument for ensuring material and human progressand should become a goal during the internationalcommunity during the next decade.Institutional conditions that would generate jobsare of a varied nature and depend on the specificcontext of every country. However  in developingcountries  the ability of democratic governments tomeet the legitimate demands of job creation from theirsocieties are impaired by the protectionist measuresthat limit trade  especially in the agricultural sector.The developed world spends more than $300 billion ayear on production subsidies  a figure six times higherthan that of the direct aid given to poor countries. Thepoorest countries lose almost $40 billion a yearthrough loss of exports due to the agriculturalprotectionism of industrialized countries.The world and the attitude of the developedcountries must change if we are to turn things around.No political system or economic plan can besustainable while we have the current critical levels of28poverty and inequality. This is not something that willfavour a particular group of countries; it will promotepeace and security throughout the world.In addition  there is the problem of excessiveexternal indebtedness  the current design of theinternational financial machinery and the role playedby multilateral funding organizations. The 1990s  withits financial excesses at the global level  saw theexpansion of already oversized debts for a largenumber of countries. For the sake of the developmentof these countries and the international financialsystem itself  it is important to emphasize the idea thateconomic growth is the central and decisive variablewhen it comes to capacity to pay and debtsustainability.During the recent international financial crises multilateral funding agencies made a series of mistakesin trying to resolve these problems. The solutionsproposed spread to other countries  and this greatlymagnified the problem of hunger and poverty.Argentinaís case is an example. After havingapplied throughout the 1990s the formulas proposed bythe multilateral financial agencies  the countryexperienced a financial crisis that is still not entirelyresolved. In 2002  the International Monetary Fund(IMF) made a serious mistake in diagnosing theproblem that led to major prognostic errors and poorpolicy recommendations.On the basis of our more recent experience  andbecause of the debt experience  we conclude that wehave to provide greater leeway to national authorities.We need a different relationship with the IMF  onefavouring a solution consistent with the countryíscapacity to pay  sustainable over the medium and longterm and supportive of the principles of equality  socialjustice  the fight against poverty  hunger andunemployment.We must promote the reformulation of fiscalaccounting methods in the majority of countries  and inparticular in the international financial organizations with the aim of excluding investment in infrastructure from current spending in the calculation of surpluses.We know that fiscal surpluses are necessary inorder to stabilize economies and respect obligations tothe international financial community  but it must beunderstood that no surplus is defensible. Whensurpluses are achieved  thanks to the elimination ofinvestment in physical and social infrastructure  thisaffects the possibility of political stability and growth which turns something that was positive for countriesinto an imbalance and a negative for the overallfunctioning of the economy.From the tragedy of excessively indebtedcountries  we conclude that simple formulas whichclaim to be universal and applicable under anycircumstance  at any time and in any place are onlyideological approaches to concrete issues that must beresolved with realism  flexibility and proactiveattitudes.We take responsibility for the adoption of alienpolicies that led us to the worst of all worlds. But it isnot enough for the multilateral lending agencies simplyto acknowledge their mistake in recommending requiring and supporting such policies. What we needis an urgent and drastic structural reform of the IMFthat will enable it to prevent crises and help to resolvethem. From a lender of development funds it hasbecome a creditor demanding concessions. This trendhas to change. Otherwise  we will be confined tostructural reforms of a theoretical nature the results ofwhich will guarantee nothing to anyone  and then aseries of self-critical reviews.Meanwhile  in our countries inequality willincrease because of the implementation of thosereforms. The excluded millions those reforms havecreated will weep and poverty will spread. Mea culpaswill be uttered  and we will see the growth in thenumber of poor people  if we bother to notice them.That is why we say that what is most in need ofstructural reform are the international lending agencies.On another subject  we firmly support UnitedNations peacekeeping operations set up through theappropriate organs. This year we have doubled ourmilitary and police staff in peacekeeping operations;currently Argentina is involved in eight of the present16 operations.The recently created United Nations StabilizationMission in Haiti is of particular importance. It is theonly mission established by the Security Council todaythat is located on American soil. The region has made acommitment to help the poorest country in theAmericas to return to the path of growth and freedomand to guarantee democracy as the best way ofensuring dignity  social and economic development andfull respect for human rights.29In that regard  Argentina reaffirms its position ofprinciple based on universal respect for human rightsand for international humanitarian law. The history ofArgentina explains my Governmentís firm position onan issue that is now part of its identity as a democraticnation.International disputes must be settled throughpeaceful means. The United Nations has established through different resolutions of the General Assemblyand the Special Committee on the Situation with regardto the Implementation of the Declaration on theGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries andPeoples  that the question of the Malvinas SouthGeorgia and the South Sandwich islands is a specialcolonial situation  which must be resolved throughbilateral negotiations between my country and theUnited Kingdom. The decolonization Committee hasexpressed itself repeatedly on this issue  and we greatlyappreciate its work to promote the resolution of thisquestion. We reaffirm once again the constantwillingness of my country to reach a just  peaceful andlasting solution to this sovereignty dispute  which is anissue of great importance for the people of Argentina.We urge the United Kingdom to comply promptly withthe international communityís appeal and to resumenegotiations.In the southern framework  we are committed toprotecting the international communityís interests inAntarctica by ensuring that all activities there arecompatible with the Antarctic Treaty and with itsMadrid Protocol on Environmental Protection. Theestablishment of the Antarctic Treaty secretariat inBuenos Aires is already a reality. We are grateful forthe assistance of those who always supportedArgentina as home of the secretariat  whichundoubtedly will contribute to achieving the mainobjectives of the Antarctic Treaty system.As a peace-loving State committed tomultilateralism  Argentina has always supported thesettlement of disputes through negotiation anddialogue  in keeping with equity and justice. In thatrespect  our country fully supports the achievement ofa stable and lasting peace in the Middle East  based onthe inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to an independent  viable State while at the same time supporting the right of Israel tolive in peace with its neighbours within safe andinternationally recognized borders. We hope that theparties will resume negotiations with a view toresolving their differences and will comply with theirrespective obligations under the road map ó a planwhich Argentina  along with the rest of theinternational community  considers the best way toachieve a lasting and just peace in the region.The Argentine Republic supports the attainmentof the objectives of reducing hunger and poverty andthe provision of safe drinking water and sanitation which were the main topics of the World Summit onSustainable Development  held in Johannesburg10 years after the Rio de Janeiro Conference onEnvironment and Development.The protection of the atmosphere is of specialconcern to us  with respect not only to the ozone layer but to all the action needed to attenuate climate changeand to help adapt to the changes that are already takingplace ó which are at the root of the severe weatherconditions that affect developing countries inparticular. In view of our concern  and convinced of theneed for the prompt entry into force of the KyotoProtocol  we have invited to Buenos Aires the tenthConference of the Parties to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change in order tohelp to give greater impetus to our joint effort to adapt.I hope to be able to welcome and host Governmentdelegations at the high-level segment that I will havethe honour of opening in Buenos Aires.For that reason  we are calling upon theAssembly to show the necessary strength  courage andresolve to create a world of justice and equity and toput an end to the unfair rules often imposed bymultilateral financial institutions  which cause verydifficult problems for many countries and whichincrease poverty."
"7",260,"ARM",59,2004," We wish to extend ourcongratulations to you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. We would also like to thank to Mr. JulianHunte and the Secretary-General for their effortsduring this difficult year.Last year  we expressed our concern about therestoration of sovereignty in Iraq and thereinvigoration of the Middle East peace process. Thisyear  we wish especially to note the critical need to endthe tragedy in Darfur. Armenians  victims of thetwentieth century’s first genocide  know well the long-lasting effects of victimization and homelessness. Thisis no way to begin a new millennium. The benefits ofglobalization should be utilized to overcome thisnewest global crisis.We also comprehend all too well that peace andsecurity abroad and at home are clearly associated with18social and economic dignity today — or with faith intheir possible attainment tomorrow. Neither self-satisfied smugness on the one hand nor self-righteousviolence on the other are solutions to the greatinequalities that exist around the world and within eachof our countries  even the most developed of them.Terrorism  in all its manifestations  affectssecurity and political and economic stability in ourneighbourhoods and throughout our planet. Terrorism from Madrid to Beslan  in all its manifestations  isinexcusable and unacceptable. Cognizant that thesuccess of counter-terrorism efforts is dependent uponcollective measures  Armenia has readily joined theglobal fight against international terrorism. That fightmust go beyond effective regional and internationalcooperation. It must include the very goals of theMillennium Declaration: replacing deprivation  povertyand injustice with universal respect for human rightsand democracy  economic development  equality andsocial justice.In Armenia we have had a year in whicheconomic growth went hand in hand with increasedparticipation in international organizations  particularlyin the United Nations. Our position in the HumanDevelopment Index gives us the confidence to continueon our path of economic development. We will alsowork hard to bolster public-private partnerships. Weare proud that Armenia’s major enterprises are findingways to contribute to art and culture  to invest in publiclife and to become partners in our society’s pursuit ofhappiness and quality of life.In 2005  the international community will reviewthe progress that has been made in the implementationof the global development agenda. It would be mostuseful if we could focus our resources on theimplementation of the agenda rather than on restatingour collective good intentions. In other words  we mustfind the political will to make the political andfinancial commitments necessary to overcome theoutstanding obstacles.The Millennium Development Goals areguidelines for Armenia. To that end  the empowermentof women  the protection of children and the fightagainst poverty are not just goals for us: they arebuilding blocks for a prosperous  healthy and stablesociety. The Government of Armenia has approvednational action plans on the protection of the rights ofthe child  on improving the status of women andenhancing their role in our society and on preventingtrafficking in persons. In addition  a broad anti-corruption strategy  developed with the participationand counsel of the international community  willcomplement the poverty reduction strategy programmethat is already beginning to yield results.We are continuing our effective collaborationwith United Nations bodies on a number of importantissues  including use of information andcommunication technologies to improve governanceand institutionalize public/private interactions. Withdonor community support  focused institution-buildingand good governance  we expect that the human rightsand democratic reforms of the past decade will gobeyond the solid legislative framework that has alreadybeen developed and will take root — psychologicallyand socially — in our society.Armenia  as an active member of the Economicand Social Council and the Commission on HumanRights  will remain involved in internationaldevelopment cooperation. At the same time  we willparticipate in the effort to improve the consultation andcoordination mechanisms that are essential for theeffectiveness of the collective security system and welook forward to the assessment of the High-level Panelon Threats  Challenges and Change.We stand for broader cooperation between theUnited Nations and regional organizations to ensurethe broader involvement and commitment of countriesin decision-making and implementation processes.Reform is necessary within those valued organizationsif we are to effectively address today’s realities andchallenges and resolve tomorrow’s problems. To dothat  we cannot work with yesterday’s mechanisms. Arevitalized General Assembly is indispensable foreffective United Nations action. We would also supportJapan  Germany and India joining countries fromAfrica and Latin America as permanent members of anenlarged and more representative Security Council.In a few short years  Armenia has done away withthe false proposition that we must choose between Eastand West  between the old world and the new. We havedone away with the myth that our neighbours cancontrol the pace of our economic development andshape its direction. Now we want to do away with thevery dangerous notion that yesterday’s adversaries areenemies forever.19Armenia is ready to compromise and collaboratewith neighbours who are ready to join us in makinghistory  not rewriting it. We want to work with anAzerbaijan that understands its place in a rule-basedinternational order  not one whose policies  practicesand statements threaten the fragile peace and stabilityof our region.Azerbaijan was the first to introduce ethniccleansing in the Soviet space  the first to engagemercenaries and international terrorists in its owndefence and the first to discard the “rules ofengagement” in international organizations.Let me explain. The Armenian presence in theregion of the Caucasus has been long and extensive.Indeed  denying or rewriting that history requiressystematic planning  energy and resources.Unfortunately  the Government of Azerbaijan has notspared those resources. Azerbaijan succeeded ineliminating the Armenians of Nakhichevan  whocomprised more than half the population there. Therewere more than 400 000 Armenians living inAzerbaijan during the Soviet period. The pogroms ofSumgait and Baku led to the fact that there are nonetoday. Indeed  the Azerbaijani experiment in ethniccleansing worked.A decade ago  Azerbaijan retained the services ofmercenaries and international terrorists — the samenames we hear today — to fight against the Armenianmen and women who were defending their own landsand homes against aerial bombings and proximateshelling. The terrorists lost  Armenians won.Finally  Azerbaijan’s leadership dismisses theopportunities offered by membership in internationalorganizations to build bridges and seek solutions.Today  Azerbaijan rejects mediation by those who wishto help halt drug trafficking through its territory. Itdismisses efforts by the Council of Europe and othermonitoring groups to come to the region and see withtheir own eyes  at first hand  the destruction ofthousands of irreplaceable historic and culturalmarkers. Azerbaijan squawks about its desire forNATO membership  even as it repeatedly prohibits apartner’s participation in NATO exercises. Worse Azerbaijan not only does not rebuke  it champions theAzerbaijani military officer who decapitated a fellowArmenian officer in a NATO training course inBudapest. It maligns the Minsk Group of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe tohide its own refusal to consider the proposals that havegrown from the discussions and negotiations in whichits own leadership has participated. For more than halfa decade  Azerbaijan has rejected every proposalbefore it from the “common State” proposal in 1998 tothe Key West document of 2001.Armenians prevailed in the military confrontationunleashed by Azerbaijan in response to the peacefuldemands of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh for self-determination. Contrary to the assertion made byAzerbaijan’s President from this podium  Armenianshave occupied those lands for over 2 000 years  and notjust the last 10. Today  Nagorno-Karabakh has reversedthe injustice done by Stalin back in the mid-1920s. It isfree  democratic and tolerant of minorities. Nagorno-Karabakh holds regular elections  has State andsecurity structures  completely controls its ownterritory and has a growing economy.If in the past century Armenians and Azerbaijaniswere forcibly linked together  in the present century —in which we have won the right to our own destinies —we can determine to live together peaceably. If we areserious about becoming full  deserving residents of theEuropean neighbourhood — where borders do notcount  but intentions and tolerance do — we will haveto come to terms with our past  with our history andwith the realities that have gripped our region."
"8",293,"ATG",59,2004,"I standbefore the General Assembly of the United Nationswith an equal measure of pride and humility.Of the more than 190 nations that make up theUnited Nations  Antigua and Barbuda is among thesmallest in population and land mass. In the face ofthese strikingly modest statistics  my humility instanding at this renowned and universally respectedpodium will be readily understood. The fact that21Antigua and Barbuda is accorded the privilege to addressthe United Nations today is obvious cause for pride.On a personal note  I have just completed my firstsix months as Prime Minister in the first term of theparty that was elected to govern Antigua and Barbudaon 23 March of this year. It is  therefore  a particularpleasure and a special personal privilege for me to beafforded this opportunity to take the podium at thefifty-ninth session of the General Assembly.I take this opportunity to express my appreciationto the Secretary-General for the kind sentiments hegraciously extended on the formation of myGovernment. Considering that a single party had ruledAntigua and Barbuda throughout the life of our 23-yearold nation  and for some considerable time prior tothat  my leadership and my Government are still in atender state of infancy. I therefore trust that  should Ibe guilty of any lapse in protocol during my remarks you will blame it on my innocence.The removal of a long-entrenched Governmentmakes 2004 a year of dramatic change and intimidatingchallenge for Antigua and Barbuda. The UnitedNations human development index ranks Antigua andBarbuda in the high development scale. By virtue ofour per-capita income  Antigua and Barbuda isdesignated a middle-income country.Though it is self-evident that all countries are notcreated equal  it is a fundamental purpose of the UnitedNations to ensure a level playing field in the arena inwhich small as well as large nations of the worldengage one another. I say this despite overwhelmingempirical evidence that size and might often come intoplay without subtlety  without apology and sometimeswithout sufficiently vigorous challenge in the affairs ofthe United Nations.The structure of the Security Council dramatizesthe reality that one nation  one vote  still has itslimitations. In this context  we might be tempted toaccept  as Nobel Laureate V. S. Naipul asserts in theopening line of his book  A Bend in the River: “Theworld is what it is”. I submit that the overarchingmission of the United Nations is to defy the status quoand to work unrelentingly to transform the world fromwhat it is into what it can be. The logical andparticularly relevant concomitance to all of this is thata fundamental function of the United Nations is toassist small Member States like Antigua and Barbudato be all that we can be. We recognize that the UnitedNations has been making every conceivable effort tomeet this mandate  most notably so under thestewardship of our indomitable Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan.Not surprisingly  small societies like those of theEnglish-speaking Caribbean have become casualties not beneficiaries  of globalization and of the new worldeconomic order. The United Nations acknowledged thisin the Millennium Declaration. The Declarationconcedes that  while globalization offers greatopportunities  its benefits are very unevenly shared while its costs are unevenly distributed. It recognizedthat developing countries and countries with economiesin transition face special difficulties in responding tothe challenges of globalization.The Millennium Declaration defined the need forpolicies and measures at the global level that correspondto the needs of developing countries and economies intransition and that are formulated and implementedwith their effective participation. It recognized acollective responsibility to uphold the principles ofhuman dignity  equality and equity at the global level.It affirmed a determination to deal comprehensivelyand effectively with the debt problems of low andmiddle-income developing countries through variousnational and international measures designed to maketheir debt sustainable in the long term.Still  the reality confronts us that the views of allother United Nations Member States are outweighed bythose of the five permanent members of the SecurityCouncil.Moreover  the world saw  not all that long ago effective marginalization of the United Nations indefiance of rational concerns  strongly expressed  ofthe general membership of the United Nations. I haveno desire to be trampled underfoot by the elephantsengaged in the historic battle that raged in this forumbefore it moved to its still active theatre in the MiddleEast earlier this year. I am  however  compelled towonder by what process the United Nations appears tohave ruled out a negotiated resolution of the ongoingwar in Iraq as an option.It is lamentable that  in meeting the unique needsof vulnerable small States and microeconomies  theUnited Nations is routinely sidelined in internationaltrading relationships and development processes. TheUnited Nations is not recognized as a key catalyst indefining the world economic order and international22trading arrangements in the twenty-first century. Thatagenda is understood to be directed by entities such asthe World Trade Organization  the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  theFinancial Action Task Force  the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Bank. Two of thoseorganizations are assemblies of a small number ofwealthy nations that do not necessarily attach adequatepriority to the vulnerability of small States andeconomies in transition.We are not all convinced that those organizations whose decisions can well determine the destiny ofsmall States like Antigua and Barbuda — and the nowdesolate Grenada and Haiti — are sufficiently responsiveto the special needs of small Caribbean States.Indeed  the instances in which small countries ofthe Caribbean have been targets of the OECD and themighty United States are vivid in our consciousness.Super Power intervention in traditional arrangementsbetween Europe and the Caribbean for bananas andsugar has been no less devastating  and it has certainlybeen farther reaching than Hurricane Ivan’s savagedemolition of Grenada. The OECD offensive againstwhat were termed “harmful tax jurisdictions” manifestly discriminated against international financialcentres in the Caribbean. Our responses to thischallenge were responsible and effective.We would like to think that the English-speakingCaribbean countries are model nations in the family ofman. We represent a zone of peace in a world shatteredby internecine and international wars. We maintainexemplary parliamentary democracies. With a few sadexceptions  we in the Caribbean change ourGovernments by the ballot  and by no other means.Though we are small  we are overwhelming inhuman worth. The Commonwealth Caribbean gaveBob Marley to the world. We gave Nobel LaureatesArthur Lewis  Derek Walcott and Vidia Naipaul to theworld. We have given our music to the world in theform of reggae  calypso  soca and steel band. We haveenriched the cuisines of the world. We have given thefastest female track athletes to the world. We havecontributed to the standard of academia around theworld through the export of many of our finest minds.We have been blessed with the most desirablebeaches in the world  and we welcome the world toshare our beaches and our incomparable naturalenvironment. Our islands represent green points oflight on a globe convulsed by callous attitudes to theenvironment among certain developed countries  andamong countries in transition  as well.Small though our nations may be  we are mightywarriors in strong and effective alliances with theUnited States  Canada  the United Kingdom and othernations in the war against the international narcoticssyndicates.I deem it my country’s civic responsibility toremind this body of our duty to fulfil our role asoutlined in the preamble of the United Nations Charter to be the central area for harmonizing the actions ofnations in achieving international cooperation insolving issues of a humanitarian nature.Today two nations within the Caribbean region Grenada and Haiti  have been devastated by naturaldisaster. Some 90 per cent of Grenada’s housing stockhas been destroyed. Civil society is in deep trauma.The economy has been wiped out and the Governmentis completely immobilized. This means that there is anineffective authority.More than 1 000 persons have just died in Haitiin the wake of Hurricane Jean  with the figure expectedto double in days. The dead are being buried in massgraves to prevent a health epidemic. Homes and cropshave been destroyed  with floodwater lines onbuildings measuring up to 10 feet high. Survivors inHaiti’s third largest city  Gonaives  are hungry  thirsty andincreasingly desperate. United Nations peacekeepers andaid agencies are stretched to the limit.Grenada and Haiti are now suffering a conditioncomparable to a massive military bombardment.Against this backdrop  I urge the United Nations —every nation  large and small — to intervene in thosetwo Caribbean countries devastated by recenthurricanes. They are certifiable disaster areas.An adequate response from all of us  and evenmore so from the developed countries  to the plight ofGrenada and Haiti would be a quantum leap to recoveryand reconstruction for them and the best option to easethe suffering of their battered and distressed people. Wemust act quickly. We must act now.If I may be so bold  I would like to say that mycountry  Antigua and Barbuda  is a veritable UnitedNations in microcosm. It has become home to arelatively larger proportion of immigrants fromCaribbean countries than has any other Caribbean23State. On any day  on any street in St. John’s  Antiguaand Barbuda’s capital  you will hear virtually everyCaribbean inflection  English and Hispanic. You willalso hear accents from China  Syria  Lebanon  Europeand Africa. Indeed  we are celebrating Antigua andBarbuda’s unique diversity with the construction of aCaribbean Festival Park that will be a permanentshowcase and celebration of the essence of the entireCaribbean region.I have chosen to use this opportunity to urge theUnited Nations General Assembly to petition powerfulnations and agencies of the world for a review of thepolicy of penalizing small States that achieve ameasure of success in the process of guiding theireconomies to growth and their citizens to better lives.Is it not ironic that  only in the area of developmentfunding  achieving “graduation” is rewarded withpunishment? Development funding dries up; technicalaid is more difficult to access when small States beginto show signs of prosperity. The effect of this is reallyto pull out the carpet from under small States themoment they stand up. Small developing States willnever be insulated against external shocks.The international security measures mandated byAmerica’s post-9/11 Patriot Act have inflicted aninordinate financial burden on the small economies ofCaribbean member States. We have been compelled tofinance security infrastructure for which we had noprovisions. With intensified security concerns in theUnited States  Caribbean countries are confronted withincreasing waves of deported felons from the UnitedStates. This carries the risk that  among thesedeportees  there might well be prime recruits fororganized crime and narco-trafficking. Caribbeansocieties are simply not equipped to respondeffectively to those challenges.Among member countries of the Organization ofEastern Caribbean States  Antigua and Barbuda isconsidered to be relatively affluent. The grim reality isthat Antigua and Barbuda is confronted with aneconomy that has been experiencing sustained decline.The country has been accumulating crippling debt. Weare uncovering disturbing levels of unemployment particularly among our young people. This can well placea significant proportion of our youth at serious risk.Many of these concerns are common to smallStates of the Caribbean. Policies and rules are made inorganizations controlled by the powerful few. Thisbrings us to the contradiction that  as small States strive tobe all that we can be  we are penalized for our success.Policy makers in the developed world  donorcountries and multilateral donor agencies should nottake our natural and physical attributes as barometersof our economic and social development.In this age of globalization  where the emphasisis on bigness  being small is definitely a disadvantageof major magnitude. Small economies cannot easilydiversify production. Jobs are concentrated in a limitednumber of industries — namely  agriculture  tourismand services. Tragically  we are now encountering asituation where our unemployed young people areeasily induced into the drug trade.Given that the Caribbean region is a recognizeddrug trans-shipment point between Latin America andthe United States and Europe  the attraction of easymoney and effective marketing to youth by drug donsmake this job opportunity very attractive to the youthof the Caribbean region.My party  the United Progressive Party  campaignedon a platform of transparency  accountability andintegrity in every functional aspect of government  andthroughout the society as a whole. As a demonstration ofmy Government’s seriousness in combating corruption  Itabled anticorruption and integrity legislation in ourParliament during our first six months in Government.My Government and the majority of the people ofAntigua and Barbuda are committed to every optionthat will support our dedication to good governance inour country.I challenge the United Nations to stand by thetenets of the Millennium Declaration  which call forequity among nations  large and small. There is acompelling reason for this call.Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries arecurrently engaged in three separate sets of negotiationsthat will seriously impact the economies of ourcountries and the welfare of our people. To date  therehave been no concessions afforded to the special needsof small States in our negotiations with the EuropeanUnion  on the Free Trade Area of the Americas andwith the World Trade Organization. Not everyoneengaged in these negotiations appears to be insympathy with the fundamental goals of the UnitedNations Millennium Declaration.24If affirmative action is not to be proffered toAntigua and Barbuda and other small States of theCaribbean region and the world  let us at least bespared punitive suspension of whatever specialfacilities enabled us to move our economies forward.Antigua and Barbuda thanks this GeneralAssembly for the opportunity to propose that  inkeeping with the letter and the spirit of the UnitedNations Millennium Declaration  small States  such asthose of CARICOM  should be afforded the promisedopportunity to be beneficiaries of globalization and thenew world economic architecture  instead of leaving uscasualties  as we must now be accurately described."
"9",340,"AUS",59,2004,"Sir  let me begin bycongratulating you on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session  and let me20say how honoured I am to be one of your Vice-Presidents.I want to say also how delighted Australia is towelcome Iraq back to the General Assembly.We  the nations of the world  gathered here at thefifty-ninth session of the General Assembly  facechallenges to international security and prosperity thatare very different from those which existed at the birthof the United Nations. However  the aims of the UnitedNations as set out in the Preamble to the Charterremain as relevant and vital today as they did then:“to save successive generations from the scourgeof war … to reaffirm faith in fundamental humanrights ... to establish conditions under whichjustice and respect for the obligations arisingfrom treaties and other sources of internationallaw can be maintained … and to promote socialprogress and better standards of life in largerfreedom”.Today  the menace of terrorism and the dangers ofproliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)cast their shadow across the globe  threatening not onlyour security  but also the development gains and futureprosperity of all nations.It is this new international environment  this newreality  to which we must all adjust. The UnitedNations is no exception. The United Nations is a vitalinstitution that does great humanitarian work  but itmust strengthen its capacity to deal effectively with theproblems we now face or risk sliding into irrelevance.The Secretary-General himself recognized thislast year when he said that we have come to a fork inthe road  a moment no less decisive than in 1945 whenthe United Nations was founded. And  again this year he stated that if the leaders of the world could notagree on the way forward  history would take thedecisions. The issue he raises for us all is whether we the United Nations membership  can rise to thechallenge and take the steps necessary for theOrganization to fulfil its aims in today’s world.Australia strongly supported last year theestablishment by the Secretary-General of a High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change  and westand ready to contribute to ambitious outcomes. I wantto return to the work of the Panel later in this address.There would be few nations in the roomuntouched by terrorism. As the cowardly attacks inBeslan and at the Australian Embassy in Jakartaillustrate  terrorism will not simply fade away. Inresponse  we  the international community  cannotallow security threats to fester. What is required is newthinking  practical action  and cooperation betweenGovernments. Obviously  the United Nations has aprimary role to play. But Governments and regionalorganizations must also ensure that their resources andinfrastructure can respond to the current environment.This is a responsibility Australia has taken veryseriously. On terrorism  we have fully supported thework of the United Nations  ensuring Jema’ahIslamiyah was listed as a terrorist organization underthe Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) sanctionsregime and promoting compliance with the UnitedNations terrorist asset freezing regime.We have committed energy and resources tobuilding counter-terrorism cooperation in our ownregion  both bilaterally and through organizations suchas the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and theRegional Forum of the Association of South-EastAsian Nations. We are also committed to buildingunderstanding as part of a comprehensive approach.This is evident in the messages we convey to ourregional partners and to Australians — namely  that ourefforts to stop a minority of extremist Muslim terroristsis not a war on Islam; that Muslims are as much thevictims of terrorist attacks and must defendthemselves; and that we must all work to defeatterrorism together.Our cooperation with regional partners hasdelivered results  but as the recent bombing in Jakartaillustrates  terrorism in our own region is not yetdefeated. While Australia’s embassy in Jakarta mayhave been the target of the latest attack  it was as muchan assault on Indonesia as on Australia  and we areparticularly saddened by the loss of innocentIndonesian lives. Indonesia and Australia aredetermined to catch the perpetrators and see justicedone  for the bonds between us cannot be split byterrorists  but only strengthened.Australia’s commitment to a stable and secureregion is particularly reflected in our efforts in thePacific. Since 11 September 2001  we have come toappreciate more acutely the dangers weak and failingStates can pose to security. Of course  not all such21States are home to terrorists  but where instability andvulnerabilities exist  so  too  do opportunities for crimeand the potential for human suffering.When our Foreign Minister  Alexander Downer addressed this forum last year  he noted Australia wasdeveloping regional approaches to confront the dangersof State failure and that with our Pacific Islands Forumpartners we were restoring hope to the people ofSolomon Islands. In just one year  the RegionalAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands has madeexcellent progress in restoring stability and law andconsolidating Government finances  and is nowmoving into long-term governance reform.Australia is also working with other States in ourregion  notably Papua New Guinea and Nauru  toaddress economic management and governance issues.Regional cooperation is being strengthened through thePacific Plan  an initiative of the recent Pacific IslandsForum meeting in Apia  which seeks to enhancecollaboration in areas of governance. I am delighted tosee among us today the Secretary-General of thePacific Islands Forum and welcome him to this Hall.We would encourage the High-level Panel onThreats  Challenges and Change to outline ambitiousproposals for effective collective action to addressfailed and failing States  including more explicitprovision for action by regional and other plurilateralarrangements  as set out in Chapter VIII of the Charter.Iraq is at a critical moment in its politicalevolution. A small minority is bent on destruction andmurder and wants to deny the Iraqi people theiropportunity to express their political will throughelections. This minority also attacks those who areworking to rebuild Iraq’s economy and improve Iraqilives. Increasingly  Iraqis themselves will beresponsible for doing that work  but success willdepend on the resolute support of the internationalcommunity.We cannot allow terrorists to disrupt thedemocratic process in Iraq. Prime Minister Alawi hasemphasized his Government’s determination to holdelections in January 2005 and the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General in Iraq hastold the Security Council that maintaining the electionschedule is his greatest priority. While the difficultsecurity conditions in Iraq cannot be denied  it isimperative that the United Nations fulfil its role underSecurity Council resolution 1546 (2004) and work withIraqis to complete arrangements for the elections ontime.The size of the United Nations presence in Iraqmust be commensurate with the importance andurgency of its task. For its part  Australia remainscommitted to assisting Iraq transform itself. To thisend  we have committed more than $125 million  muchof it directed through United Nations agencies.The situation in Darfur is a humanitarian disaster.Australia is committed to supporting urgentinternational efforts to end this horrific crisis. We havealready committed $20 million in emergency assistancefor the people of Darfur. We welcome the adoption ofSecurity Council resolution 1564 (2004) and applaudthe African Union for agreeing to lead a mission toDarfur. Let me make this very clear: we stand ready tooffer assistance to this mission. The situation in Darfurhighlights the need for the international community todevelop a better framework for responding tohumanitarian crises  and we hope the High-level Panelon Threats  Challenges and Change will come up withclear and workable recommendations on humanitarianintervention.The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction(WMDs) is another urgent concern. Unless we actfirmly and with unity  terrorist groups could one dayacquire WMDs with disastrous consequences. As athreat to international security  the issue of WMDproliferation falls squarely within the SecurityCouncil’s mandate. We welcome the adoption ofresolution 1540 (2004) as a demonstration of theCouncil’s willingness to tackle WMD proliferation including the risk of WMD terrorism. We hope thatwith the adoption of this resolution  the Council willtake a firmer and more active stance on WMD issues.As part of our commitment to combating the riskof nuclear terrorism  Australia will host an Asia-Pacificministerial conference in November on nuclearsafeguards and security. In addition  in the FirstCommittee this year  we  along with Turkey andArgentina  will introduce a draft resolution on theprevention of the illicit transfer and unauthorizedaccess to  and use of  man-portable air defence systems(MANPADS). We hope for a consensus adoption ofthis draft resolution  which encourages States to takeconcrete steps to prevent MANPADS from falling intothe hands of non-State end-users.22Allow me to return to the subject of the High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change. Duringthis address  I have referred several times toit. Australia welcomes the direction of paneldiscussions — as far as we understand them — withrespect to both doctrinal and institutional reform. Wehave contributed actively to the Panel’s work and weencourage the Panel  in its remaining deliberations  towork towards ambitious recommendations on its entireprogramme of work  including Security Councilreform  addressing threats from WMDs and terrorism humanitarian intervention and effective collectiveaction.On the issue of structural reform  we note herethat Australia has advocated expanding the permanentmembership of the Security Council to make it morecompatible with geographical realities  through theaddition of Japan  India  Brazil  an African country andIndonesia. Whatever the final shape of the Panel’sreport  one thing is clear: high-level politicalcommitment will be crucial to bringing bold reformrecommendations to fruition. We would encourage allMember States to give the Secretary-General their fullsupport in considering the Panel’s recommendations.One opportunity to do this will be the 2005United Nations summit of heads of State orGovernment. The summit provides an excellent forum not only to review implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  but also to endorse a reformedUnited Nations that is better equipped to deal with thechallenges it faces.Australia has long advocated the need for UnitedNations reform. Back in 2000 in this forum  the PrimeMinister warned that “In the absence of change and adaptation  theOrganization will wither as the nations of theworld bypass it in favour of ... mechanisms thatare more relevant to their needs” (A/55/PV.20 p. 25).Of course  this warning was before 11 September2001  before coalition action in Afghanistan and Iraqand before the terrorist bombings in Bali  Jakarta Madrid  Istanbul and many other locations. If the need forreform was pressing then  it is critical now. The High-level Panel provides the best prospect for repositioningthe United Nations system to meet contemporarychallenges. This is an opportunity we cannot waste if theUnited Nations — our Organization — is to retain asubstantial role in maintaining international peace andsecurity in the twenty-first century."
"10",387,"AUT",59,2004,"I should like tobegin by congratulating Mr. Jean Ping on his electionas President of the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. He may be sure that Austria will fullysupport him in carrying out his important task.I fully subscribe to the statement made by theMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands onbehalf of the European Union  which expressed theposition of the European Union regarding the variousglobal and regional challenges we face today. I wouldlike to emphasize a few additional points from our ownperspective.Over the past few years we have had to reassesskey concepts of our national and international securityenvironment. With the emergence of new and complexthreats  in particular terrorism in combination with theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction  theinternational community faces unprecedentedchallenges for which it has to find legitimateresponses. Just recently  we witnessed the horrifyingterrorist attack against innocent school children inBeslan. This was only the last of a whole series ofheinous attacks in all regions of the world targetedagainst innocents.Austria is committed to full cooperation withother States and United Nations bodies involved incounter-terrorism and is working to promote the wholerange of United Nations action against terrorism. InVienna  the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimeand its Terrorism Prevention Branch make an importantcontribution by rendering assistance to Member Statesin implementing national legislation required bySecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and inbuilding their national capacity to do so.Austria is convinced that only effectivemultilateralism based on the rule of law can address thenew and complex challenges that the internationalcommunity faces today. We support the efforts of theQuartet in the Middle East peace process  and we urgeIsrael and the Palestinians to implement theirrespective obligations. The road map remains the onlyway forward towards a just  comprehensive and lastingsettlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict leading to twoStates living side by side in peace and security.The United Nations continues to play a key rolein South-Eastern Europe  especially in Kosovo. Wewelcome the recent appointment of Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen as Special Representative for Kosovo. In thatregard  within the European Union  the countries of theregional partnership ó the Czech Republic  Hungary Poland  Slovakia  Slovenia and my country  Austria ópresented concrete proposals with regard to security economic development  decentralization and theprotection of minorities and of religious sites. We areconfident that they can contribute to progress inKosovo.International and regional efforts are essential ifwe are to contain and resolve the various conflicts in28other regions of the world. The dramatic situation inDarfur highlights the need for better harmonization of theinternational efforts of the United Nations  the AfricanUnion  the EU  the League of Arab States  the UnitedStates and other actors. We will have to examinecarefully the results of the current mission to Darfur ofthe new Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocideand the High Commissioner for Human Rights.Such missions and mechanisms are indeed thetools that the United Nations needs if it is to effectivelyaddress emerging crisis situations. Strengthening therule of law  human rights  democratic participation andeconomic development will reduce the chance ofconflicts within societies and among States turningviolent. In order to be a credible player  the UnitedNations must be given the necessary institutionalframework to enact effective strategies at all stages ofa conflict.Austria therefore welcomed the Secretary-Generalís call for reform  in particular his initiative toestablish a High-Level Panel of eminent persons topropose specific measures for institutional innovationby the end of the year. I was happy to meet with themembers of the Panel when it held its meeting inAustria earlier this year.One item on the Panel's agenda is SecurityCouncil reform. Austria  like many other countries  isconcerned about the growing gap between theCouncilís current composition on the one hand  and thechanging political  economic and social reality of thecommunity of nations on the other.It is essential to enlarge and balance themembership of the Security Council  as well as toincrease its transparency. In order for all peoples toidentify with its decisions  we must ensure that theSecurity Council is a body that truly reflects thediversity of the world's cultures and regions by animproved representation of regions such as Africa Asia and Latin America.As you know  Sir  it is my personal vision that  inthe longer term  the European Union should also berepresented in the Security Council. I pointed outduring the general debate last year that that would bethe logical consequence of further European integrationin the field of common foreign and security policy.The United Nations has been at the centre ofAustriaís foreign policy since we became a Memberafter regaining our full independence in 1955. We havealways strongly supported the principles and purposesof the United Nations  and we remain committed to thegoals of the Charter.Austria feels honoured and privileged to host oneof the headquarters of the United Nations. This year we celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the openingof the Vienna International Centre  home to many UnitedNations institutions. The work of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency and the Preparatory Committeeof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban TreatyOrganization with respect to nuclear non-proliferation;the work of the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganization on development cooperation; and thefight against the so-called uncivil society by the UnitedNations Office on Drugs and Crime  contributesubstantially to the international communityís efforts toconfront the worldís new security threats.In this spirit of full and honest commitment to theUnited Nations  I would like to recall that Austria is acandidate for a non-permanent seat on the SecurityCouncil for the term 2009-2010. Our candidature announced over five years ago - in 1999 - is basedon our willingness to contribute actively andconstructively to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. We fully recognize the heavyresponsibility which Security Council membershipentails and we are ready to assume it.Over the past 50 years  Austria has sought tocontribute effectively to the work of the United Nations in particular in the fields of peace and security  humanrights  development  disarmament and internationallaw. We are a significant contributor to United Nationspeacekeeping operations and have traditionally beenamong the largest European troop contributors. Since1963  over 50 000 Austrians have served in more than50 United Nations missions worldwide.Security  as we see it  means human security. It isthe kind of security that all human beings are lookingfor  among them millions of civilians in all parts of theworld affected by armed conflict ó the majority ofthem women and children ó and 40 million peopleliving with the HIV virus. Human security transcendsthe concept of hard threats and soft threats. If we seethose threats through the prism of the human beingsconcerned  it becomes clear that for the afflictedindividual  all such threats - war  hunger  terrorism ordeadly disease - deprive them of their security.29Austria is honoured to chair the first ReviewConference of States Parties to the Anti-personnelMine-Ban Convention in Nairobi later this year  wherethe international community will chart a course for thesolution of the landmine problem in the coming years.The Mine-Ban Convention has become a true exampleof a successful and effective multilateral approach toaddress a global problem. I encourage all States toparticipate at the Nairobi Summit at the highestpossible level.As a member of the Human Security Network  wecooperate with others to promote human security in theworld. To provide one concrete example  Austria -together with Slovenia and Jordan ó initiated andfunded an aid project for traumatized children in Iraq. Iam convinced that applying a human securityperspective to international problems has the potentialof preventing or resolving conflict and promotingpeace and development.We also need to reflect further on how best toensure respect for human rights during conflict  how toincorporate human rights into preventive policies andhow to formulate post-conflict strategies likely toachieve lasting reconciliation and build a firm basis forthe rule of law and good governance. In that respect human rights education is an important element ingetting to the root of conflict and breaking the viciouscircle of human rights violations.Violence between ethnic groups and religiouscommunities has shaken countries across the globe. Inparticular  the disregard for the needs and the rights ofminorities tends to fuel violent conflict. Ourendeavours for the protection of the rights of minoritiesare still highly needed  not the least to ensure thatethnic cleansing or genocide will never happen again.We know that the Secretary-General feels very stronglyabout the need for speed of action to prevent the mostheinous crimes. I share his concerns.The Austrian Government is convinced that it isan essential responsibility of the United Nations and itsMember States to address the root causes of conflict.Global poverty  inequality  competition for scarceresources  environmental degradation and the spread ofinfectious diseases  such as HIV/AIDS  are among theingredients that fuel the outbreak of conflicts bothwithin countries and among States.The Austrian Development Policy has placed aparticular focus on poverty reduction  maintenance ofpeace and the protection of the environment. I ampleased to inform the Assembly that Austria hasincreased its development aid by 35 per cent this year.In the area of environment and sustainable energy  wehave initiated and promoted the Global Forum forSustainable Energy  which aims at providing access toenergy for people in developing countries. We considerissues such as climate change  the decline ofbiodiversity and other forms of environmentaldegradation as essential aspects of our comprehensivesecurity agenda.Let me finally highlight an issue which theSecretary-General made a central theme of his addressto the General Assembly. The key guarantee forcreating and maintaining peace and security in theworld has been and will continue to be an internationalsystem based on the rule of law. This was the very ideaof the founders of the United Nations.I particularly welcome the Secretary-General'spledge two days ago that he will make the UnitedNations work to strengthen the rule of law andtransitional justice in conflict and post-conflictsocieties a priority for the remainder of his tenure.Particularly for smaller and medium sized countries  aninternational order based on the rule of law is ofparamount importance.With this in mind  I would like to announce todaythat I have launched a discourse on the role andfunction of the Security Council in strengthening arules-based international system. As a first step  wewill organize in November a panel of internationallegal experts during International Law Week atHeadquarters  which will analyse the increasing law-making tendency of the Security Council.This is my last speech as Austrian ForeignMinister. As you may know  I have been nominatedCommissioner of the European Union for ExternalRelations and European Neighbourhood Policy. Thisfunction will  of course  keep me in close contact withmany Assembly delegates and with the United Nations.I would therefore like to use this opportunity today tothank all colleagues  members of delegations and  inparticular  the Secretariat  in which I myself had thehonour to work  for the support that has been extendedto me and my staff here in New York over the pastyears. A special and warm expression of gratitude andrespect goes to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. To thePresident of the Assembly  I would like to extend my30best wishes for a successful and constructive fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly."
"11",412,"AZE",59,2004,"I would like to join previousspeakers in congratulating you  Mr. President  on yourelection to the presidency of the fifty-ninth session ofthe General Assembly. I also wish to congratulate yourpredecessor  Mr. Julian Robert Hunte  for hisexemplary stewardship of the Assembly during hispresidency of the fifty-eighth session.At the Millennium Summit  Member Statescommitted themselves to a shared vision of globalsolidarity and common security. We reaffirmed ourfaith in the United Nations and its Charter asindispensable for a more peaceful  secure and justworld. As we have entered the new century we havedone our best to maintain the vital importance ofinternational law  so that all countries may be able tocount on the Organization in their hour of need and sothat  in turn  the United Nations can fulfil what theworld expects from it.Some of our actions sought to protect millions ofinnocent people  especially women and children  whostill fall victim to brutal armed conflicts. Othersendeavoured to establish a more equitable worldeconomy  where all countries must have equal chancesat fair competition.Azerbaijan is making its own contribution to thestrengthening of global and regional security. As an activemember of the global coalition against internationalterrorism  Azerbaijan is faithfully cooperating bilaterally and within multilateral frameworks  tosuppress this evil that continues to bring death andsuffering to innocent peoples. Azerbaijan is among thecountries that have suffered directly from theconsequences of armed conflicts on its territory. Inreality those conflicts are interlinked  and we have noother choice but to face them in cooperation and unity.There should be no room for double standards.Since the very day it became a member of theUnited Nations  Azerbaijan has constantly drawn theattention of the international community to the conflict7between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh and to the occupation by Armenia ofAzerbaijani territories. Azerbaijan expected the UnitedNations to compel the aggressor to move out of its landand to allow the expelled Azerbaijani population toreturn to their homes. I should like to recall that  in1993  the Security Council unanimously adopted fourresolutions — resolutions 822 (1993)  853 (1993)  874(1993) and 884 (1993) — in response to Armenia’soccupation of sovereign Azerbaijani territories.Those resolutions confirmed that the region ofNagorno-Karabakh was part of Azerbaijan  resolutelycalled for respect for the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of Azerbaijan and its internationallyrecognized borders  and underlined the inadmissibility ofthe use of force for the purpose of acquiring territory.The resolutions demanded an immediate  complete andunconditional withdrawal of occupying forces from alloccupied areas of Azerbaijan and called for theestablishment of conditions for the safe return ofdisplaced people to their places of permanent residence.None of those resolutions — which were intendedto restore justice and peace and the territorial integrityof Azerbaijan — has been implemented by Armenia which never respected or recognized the fundamentalprinciples of international law contained in theresolutions that laid down the basis for the settlementof the conflict. Nagorno-Karabakh and seven otherregions of Azerbaijan  which make up 20 per cent ofthe territory of Azerbaijan  have been occupied byArmenia for more than 10 years. As a result of thepolicy of ethnic cleansing conducted by Armenia  morethan 1 million of Azerbaijan’s people have becomerefugees or internally displaced persons.The silence of the Security Council has had adevastating impact on the resettlement process.Armenia has ignored the resolutions and has attemptedto consolidate the results of its military aggression —and it has not been punished for it. Armeniaconsequently launched an outrageous policy involvingmassive illegal settlement of an Armenian populationin occupied Azerbaijani territories. That also is ablatant violation of international law  and in particularof the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention relative to theProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.Moreover  the situation has deteriorated  with thoseterritories being used for drug trafficking  armstransfers  the harbouring of terrorists  illegal economicactivities and smuggling. The occupied Azerbaijaniterritories have become a kind of grey zone out of thecontrol of Azerbaijan’s Government and free from anyinternational monitoring.The self-proclaimed  non-recognized so-calledNagorno-Karabakh republic is a constant threat topeace and security in the whole region. Armenianaggressors and Nagorno-Karabakh separatists are alsoexploiting natural resources in the occupiedAzerbaijani territories and are attempting to engageoverseas companies in their illegal business. I callupon Member States to take all necessary measures tomake their nationals and companies respectinternational law and to prevent them from illegalactivities on the territory of our country. For its part Azerbaijan will undertake all necessary legal andpractical measures to hold those companiesaccountable for participation in the stealing of thenatural wealth belonging to a sovereign nation.Furthermore  Armenia is falsifying history andmisappropriating the cultural and architectural heritageof the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.Religious and historical monuments  ancientmanuscripts and other cultural properties have beendestroyed  refashioned  plundered or removed.The process of political settlement of the conflictthat has been conducted within the Minsk Group of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE) during the last 12 years has thus far yielded noresults. No serious consideration has been given by theMinsk Group to the implementation of the SecurityCouncil’s resolutions  to assessing the situation on theground or to the illegal activities carried out byArmenia in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.It is obvious that  under the current passive andsilent attitude of the United Nations  the SecurityCouncil  the OSCE and the Minsk Group  and withoutstrong pressure from the international community Armenia will not abandon its aggressive anddestructive stance. The illegal actions of Armenia inoccupied Azerbaijani territories and its position in thenegotiating process prove that Armenia is not intent onfinding a solution to the problem. Rather  it intends tofurther prolong the negotiations and to consolidate theresults of its aggression  while trying ultimately toimpose a fait-accompli-based settlement.I wish to stress from this podium that a settlementof this issue must be based only on international lawand democracy  not on ethnic cleansing and the de8facto annexation of the territory of a sovereign State.Azerbaijan will never accept the occupation of itsterritory  the violation of its territorial integrity or theresults of ethnic cleansing.The return of Azerbaijan’s displaced populationto their homes remains one of our key priorities in theprocess of settling the conflict. But even before ourexpelled people  refugees and internally displacedpersons come back home  there is still an urgent needfor all the relevant United Nations agencies  donorcountries and international humanitarian organizationsto be actively involved in addressing the suffering ofthe most affected part of population.The Government of Azerbaijan does not sparetime  effort or financial resources to do its part; butgiven the scale of displacement  that is not sufficient.Burden-sharing between the Government and relevantinternational organizations is crucial. In addition topurely material support  we also request a renewal ofinternational attention to the problem and bettercoordination on the part of the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies  as well as efforts by all internationalorganizations. We expect a more responsive strategy bythe United Nations with regard to the state of theforgotten humanitarian crisis in Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan is fully committed to the objectives ofpoverty eradication and to the promotion of goodgovernance. On that basis  and as a result of themeasures we have undertaken  we are currently seeingincreased economic performance and growth.Azerbaijan is making its contribution to thedevelopment of transregional cooperation. We are alsopromoting such transportation and communicationnetworks as the Transport Corridor Europe CaucasusAsia project and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum oil and gas pipelines. Those projectswill ensure predictable access for the exports of land-locked countries to world and regional markets.The United Nations has to adapt itself in order tosuccessfully tackle all the challenges it faces. Thelong-standing issue of United Nations reform needsfinally to be resolved. The inability of the SecurityCouncil to cope with problems  and particularly thoserelated to armed conflicts  is obvious. The newSecurity Council should be more representative responsible and democratic. Its working methods mustbe more transparent and able to respond more rapidlyto the new challenges  risks and threats of the twenty-first century. Developing viable mechanisms for theimplementation of Security Council resolutions is alsoa pressing issue.It is the obligation of all of us to collectivelyapply effective approaches to current problems thereby enabling a stable environment for thesustainable growth and democratic development ofnations. That can only be achieved throughstrengthening the norms and principles of internationallaw and through friendly relations and mutuallybeneficial cooperation among States."
"12",458,"BDI",59,2004,"Onbehalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  Iextend my sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on yourwell-deserved election to the prestigious presidency ofthe General Assembly at this session. I assure you ofmy entire delegation’s unwavering support for you inyour noble work.I also pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. JulianRobert Hunte  for his excellent guidance of the work ofthe Assembly at the fifty-eighth session.I also take this opportunity once again tocongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan on hisongoing dedication and courage in discharging hisresponsibilities. I thank him for his ever-growing andresolute support for the cause of peace and securitythroughout the world and in my country  Burundi  inparticular.When the Security Council adopted resolution1545 (2004) authorizing the deployment of the UnitedNations Operation in Burundi  the United Nationsmade a real contribution to the peace process in mycountry  which two months later is now drawingtowards the final phase of that process.The signing of the Arusha Peace andReconciliation Agreement for Burundi on 28 August2000 was a decisive step forward in the peace processin my country  which since 1993 had been devastatedby the longest crisis in its history  even jeopardizingthe very existence of the nation. The Agreementushered in a new era of calm and a gradual return topeace with the conclusion of ceasefire agreements withthe armed political movements  especially since thesigning on 16 November 2003 of a comprehensiveceasefire agreement with the main rebel movementConseil national pour la défense de la démocratie-Forces nationales pour la défense de la démocratie.Today  calm has descended throughout almost allour national territory because we have acted on ourfirm commitment to implement the agreements. Fullyinclusive institutions have gradually been establishedand we are now preparing to enter the post-transitionera with elected institutions  to the satisfaction of ourpeople and that of the international community.We wish to send the strong message that we areresolved to break the logic of violence and to supportthe restoration of peace  reconciliation  democracy anddevelopment in our country. We also protect andstrengthen peace and security by integrating thefighters from the armed movements into the securityand defence forces that we will need to establish ournational army and police force  to the comfort of all.The process will be complemented by the disarmament demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants andtroops not included in the integration process.The disarmament  demobilization andprofessional or social reintegration programme iscoordinated at the uppermost level by the highestauthorities of our country  including the ministriesconcerned and representatives of the World Bank  thearmy and the armed movements. The programme iscurrently in its first phase  bringing the combatantstogether into agreed zones. Those combatants will veryshortly be transferred to the sites identified for theircantonment  while the Government troops will remainin their barracks. We already have in place a precedentfor the integration of the forces  having created aspecial institutional protection brigade on 1 July.Moreover  mixed military units have begun training ina pilot centre with a view to establishing the nationaldefence force. This approach is intended to correct theethnic and regional imbalances that have often beenobserved in our country and that have constituted thesource of the social and political conflict that hasbrought us so much suffering.The demobilization sites are ready  but we face aterrible shortage of material and financial resources topay for the increase in the numbers of people we willhave to handle in the first few years before progressivedemobilization ends. We must recall thatdemobilization and disarmament will make a realcontribution to creating a security environmentconducive to the organization of free  democratic transparent and honest elections.The draft post-transition constitution  which willserve as the basis for organizing the elections  andother legal and administrative texts were discussed atgreat length among the politicians in the President’scircle and at the levels of mediation and heads of Stateof the subregion. Some provisions on power-sharingthat did not enjoy unanimous support were upheld by20 of 30 political parties and endorsed by the twenty-second summit of heads of State of the subregion. Theywere then included in the draft constitution  which wasadopted unanimously by our Parliament  with a 70-percent attendance rate  on 17 September. We have7scheduled a referendum on the draft constitution for 20October.Thus  despite the opposition of some politicalparties  we believe that Burundi will soon have a post-transition constitution and other legal texts that arecustomary in democratic countries. We are placing ourfaith in the Independent National ElectoralCommission established to organize the technicalaspects of the elections. We would stress that theCommission will succeed only if we obtain the supportof our external bilateral and multilateral partners. Wesincerely thank those who have already pledged theirassistance  and we would urge others to follow suit.The efforts to maintain peace are still beingresisted by the Palipehutu-Forces nationales deliberation movement  which still refuses to come to thenegotiating table. Following the movement’sinvolvement in the assassination of Papal NuncioMonsignor Courtney and in the massacre of Congoleserefugees in Gatumba and elsewhere  the summit ofheads of State of the regional initiative on Burundi meeting in Dar-es-Salaam  classified it as a terroristorganization and recommended that the United Nationsand the African Union take the appropriate restrictivemeasures. Here  I would like to urge the UnitedNations to support the decisions taken at that regionalsummit and thus to follow the lead of the AfricanUnion  which has already responded favourably to thatappeal. I also take this opportunity to thank the headsof State of the subregion and the mediators for thesupport that they have constantly provided to theBurundian peace process.As everyone knows  security concerns areunfortunately not limited to within my country’sborders. The security of Burundi affects that of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Rwanda andTanzania. In the light of that interdependence  aninternational conference on peace  security  democracy economic development and regional integration in theGreat Lakes region is scheduled for November inDar es Salaam. That conference will undoubtedly havea positive effect on the countries concerned. I have thefirm conviction that it will promote a new dynamic ofpeace in the entire subregion so that we can bury thehatchet of war and turn resolutely towards the integraland integrated development of our peoples.The efforts to contain and resolve the manyconflicts that continue to shake the African continentare very instructive. First of all  the African countriesand the African Union have shown their political willand their resolve to manage their own problems despite an obvious shortage of resources. Therefore  itis time to call for the substantial strengthening ofinternational support provided to the African Unionand for much more active cooperation between theAfrican Union and the United Nations on conflictprevention and the restoration of peace. Moreover  thevarious approaches have shown us that the quest forpeace must be inclusive  not deliberately excludinganyone. That is a sensible and productive approach.Such joint action is something we hope theOrganization can do — particularly now  whenmultilateralism seems to be recovering from recentdifficult ordeals. We must therefore remain united topreserve the cherished ideals bequeathed to us by thefounders of the United Nations and enthusiasticallyreaffirmed in the Millennium Declaration.A much more cohesive and shared action underthe banner of the United Nations is thus essential at thepresent time  marked by the complexity of thechallenges we are called to face  such as nebulousinternational terrorism  which is more of a threat topeace  stability and the safety of our borders than everbefore; the risk of the proliferation of small arms andlight weapons; and prostitution and the illicit trade inhuman persons  whose effects are both cruel anddevastating to human rights  particularly children’srights.Cohesion undoubtedly implies a carefullyplanned effort. In that regard  we welcome theSecretary-General’s initiative to establish a High-LevelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change. Itsconclusions will serve as beacons to us as we seek tohumanize international relations and to promote aworld of solidarity and development compatible withthe environment.The complexity of the current challengesjustifies — now more than ever before — the urgent long-awaited reform of the Organization. We welcomethe steps already taken to streamline the workingmethods of the General Assembly and the reformsalready initiated within the Secretariat with a view toadapting the Organization’s internal structures andculture to new expectations and challenges. We hopethat the same dynamic will be applied to SecurityCouncil reform so that it will soon become a reality.8Attaining the Millennium Development Goals is achallenge for us all. Experts suggest that the effortsalready undertaken are not equal to the task. Therefore we must sharpen our focus by mobilizing more of thenecessary resources.Our moral and historic responsibility to futuregenerations is particularly great in the fight againstHIV/AIDS. Entire families have been decimated millions of children have been orphaned and elderlypersons are abandoned  alone and defenceless. It is thefamily structure that is disintegrating  and that ishorrible to see. It is our common responsibility to uniteour forces to wipe out this pandemic  which knows noborders and threatens the very survival of the humanrace. We have no right to fail.In the economic area  we know the unbearablesituation of the peoples in the least developedcountries  who are trapped in abject poverty. In thatregard  my delegation urges the internationalcommunity to work together in implementing theBrussels Programme of Action. From that perspective debt relief  more flexible conditions for joining theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative  an increasein official development assistance and the opening upof international markets deserve careful attention.The international community cannot remainindecisive on the issue of agricultural subsidies inindustrialized countries that distort the rules of thegame of free competition and considerably reduce theopportunities for poor countries to develop.Africa has enormous natural resources  yetpoverty  diseases and suffering of every kind ravage itmore than they do other continents. By forming theNew Partnership for Africa’s Development  Africanshave committed themselves to promoting goodpolitical and economic governance — a prerequisitefor sustainable development. The priorities are alreadyidentified  sector by sector  and the subregionalstructures are being further strengthened. Yet thesuccess of the efforts currently under way will dependnot only on the resolve of Africans themselves  butalso on the level of solidarity offered by theinternational community.The twentieth century and the beginning of thetwenty-first century have witnessed important forumsin which the world’s leaders have made decisivecommitments in various areas affecting humansecurity  in the profound sense of the term. Thosecommitments  which have given rise to much hopethroughout the world  have been implemented onlypartially. It is our hope that the high-level plenarymeeting scheduled for 2005 will be able to breathe newlife into the implementation of the commitments made for the happiness and prosperity of present and futuregenerations."
"13",505,"BEL",59,2004,"Belgium’s international commitment is rooted in theconviction that initiatives taken at the global level canmove forward only through dialogue and cooperation.The careful European building process taught us that.That is why Belgium firmly believes in the virtues ofmultilateralism. We are stronger standing together thanalone. By standing together  we benefit from greaterlegitimacy and therefore have better opportunities tomake our voices heard.The challenges facing the United Nations havethe virtue of being clear. As the Secretary-General hassaid  the options that become available to the worldwill depend on the answers that we provide. TheOrganization’s credibility will continue to be judged byits effectiveness and its results on the ground. We mustimprove and strengthen the United Nations apparatus.We fully support the Secretary-General’s efforts in thisdifficult task. At the same time  we believe that theUnited Nations system should better reflect the newinternational realities.The sustained commitment of the United Nationsis required if we are to find a definitive solution to the42crisis in the Great Lakes region. The conflict there hasalready cost millions of lives. We must not fail torespond; inaction would constitute negligence. While Ido not underestimate the difficulties in this regard  Iam convinced that a solution can be found. I refuse tobelieve  therefore  that the stabilization process isdoomed to deadlock or failure. In order to find asolution  however  the international community mustshow that it can make a difference. In that regard  it isencouraging to note how dedicated the Secretary-General is to his mission. For its part  Belgium willcontinue to appeal to its European Union partners for acollective and committed involvement in the region.It is essential that stability and security be fullyestablished and guaranteed in the Democratic Republicof the Congo. It is clear that the transition process mustbe successful. We in the international communitycannot emphasize enough that political leaders havethe duty to make it succeed. Indeed  there is noalternative to that process as a means of achievingpeace and development in the region.Nation-building is impossible as long as impunityand insecurity exist. In that respect  the restructuringand the integration of the army are essential  as is thedemobilization and reintegration of former combatants.Belgium is currently training almost 300 Congolesesoldiers under its Train the Trainers programme.It is also essential that the InternationalCommittee to Accompany the Transition fully shoulderits responsibilities. For its part  Belgium is committedto taking an active part in the implementation of thedeclaration adopted by the countries members of thatCommittee.The United Nations Organization Mission in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) isplaying a crucial role  and Belgium attaches greatimportance to that. It is not only the credibility of theUnited Nations that is at stake here  but — moreimportant — the future of an entire region. Belgiumtherefore supports a better targeted mandate forMONUC  as well as a strengthening of its means.With our European partners  we are alsoconsidering the best way of making a joint contributionto that Mission. It goes without saying that theelections scheduled for 2005 will be crucial. They willrequire substantial human and financial means  towhich Belgium has already decided it will contribute.With regard to the situation in Rwanda  we offerour full support to the praiseworthy efforts made toachieve reconciliation. Normalized relations betweenRwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo areabsolutely indispensable and must be based oncollaboration and good-neighbourly relations. Thisimplies a mutual respect of the borders.In many regards  the latest developments inBurundi are encouraging. A constitution has beenadopted  a referendum has been announced and anelectoral commission is in place. Elections areessential  of course  which is why Belgium hasprovided significant financial backing to theirorganization. I urge the international community tospecify without delay what resources it is ready tomobilize for this purpose.Belgium shares the concerns about thehumanitarian crisis in Darfur. There is no excuse forthe persecution and systematic massacre of thousandsof human beings. Given the scale of the suffering  theefforts and the progress made thus far remaininsufficient. Belgium therefore insists on the swiftestablishment of an international commission ofinquiry.The situation in Iraq will continue to present aconsiderable challenge over the coming months andeven years. I congratulate the United Nations for itscontinued support to the Iraqi transition process especially given the country’s climate of insecurity.The population of Iraq  which has already faced somany ordeals  must finally be able to live in peace. Itis  of course  the Iraqi people who must shoulder theresponsibility of guiding the political process  aprocess that must lead to the creation of a newparliament  a new constitution and a sovereignGovernment. This Government must be capable ofensuring the well-being of its citizens  as well as thecountry’s security  with no external assistance. To date Belgium has allocated approximately €17 million tothe reconstruction process and we will provide airtransportation for the United Nations AssistanceMission for Iraq (UNAMI) personnel between Ammanand Baghdad.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionposes a serious threat to world security. The regime ofnon-proliferation is jeopardized by an alarmingsituation; the Democratic People’s Republic of Koreamust regain its place within this regime without delay.43The Islamic Republic of Iran is located in a region fullof tensions  and its security concerns are legitimate.The international community should therefore take thisinto account in its approach to the problem. And theIranian authorities must cooperate entirely with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency and cease allactivities linked to the enrichment of uranium. By sodoing  Iran will contribute significantly to thestabilization and prosperity of the region.The tragedy in Beslan has proved once again thatterrorism attacks blindly. It goes without saying that noform of terrorism is justifiable. The indignation andanalysis that such acts may provoke can in no way varyaccording to the victim  the location  the aggressor orthe circumstances. Appropriate military means andsecurity measures will remain necessary in order tofight terrorism  but means other than strictly militaryones are also required. Indeed  the environment inwhich terrorism thrives is comprised of ideological socio-economic  political and other variables.This is why I plead for a dialogue between theWest and the Arab and Muslim world  involving notonly political leaders but also spiritual leaders  and notas a mere exchange of ideas or points of view  but inorder to identify the instruments that could deny suchbarbarous acts all legitimacy and raison d’être  with aview to finally bringing this appalling logic of death toa halt."
"14",550,"BEN",59,2004,"Allow mefirst of all to address my warmest congratulations toMr. Jean Ping on his election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Allow mealso to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Ping’seminent predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  whose greatvitality enabled him to relaunch the discussion on therevitalization of the General Assembly and to give anew impetus towards coordination among theOrganization’s main bodies. Finally  I would like toexpress to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  thegreat appreciation of the people and Government ofBenin for his work as head of our Organization; wecommend him for his courage  his skill and his visionof world affairs.People from every corner of the planet areplacing great hope in our work over the course of thissession to give hope and life to their legitimateaspirations. That can only be achieved if we all work9together  with conviction and determination  toconsolidate our commitment to multilateralism.Yes  in order to survive  our world  more thanever before  needs multilateral cooperation based onthe principles enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations. Yes  more than ever before the principles ofthe Charter must be implemented with an acute senseof responsibility and a clear understanding of theirpurpose  which is to promote international peace andsecurity and economic and social development asessential prerequisites for the promotion and protectionof human dignity.Yes  it is now on the basis of human dignity thatwe are to measure the validity and accuracy of anynational or international policy. We therefore urgeevery Member of the United Nations to examine theirconsciences and to make changes accordingly  so thatwe can give that approach its fullest meaning. It is onthis issue that the challenges are the greatest  as can beseen by the blind abuse and violence that is carried outon a massive scale by terrorists and armed groupsagainst innocent civilians.With respect to armed conflicts and theirconsequences  we must redouble our past efforts toenhance our ability to act preventively  doing all wecan to quickly and effectively defuse potential sourcesof conflicts and neutralize the seeds of conflictsituations before they germinate. As we have no otherchoice but to cure — since we have been unable toprevent — we have to considerably increase UnitedNations capabilities in the areas of peacekeeping andmanagement of post-conflict situations.We would like to reiterate our deep gratitude tothe Secretary-General for his personal commitment inseeking a rapid solution to the Ivorian crisis within theframework of the Accra III accords. The internationalcommunity — despite the erratic evolution of thesituation — must stay the course with Côte d’Ivoire inits efforts to respect its commitments and to ensure asmooth transition towards the restoration of peace  bystabilizing the situation so that that country can find itsplace within the development dynamic in the WestAfrican subregion.We also encourage the international communityto focus particular attention on the Great Lakes region which remains a source of concern. The situation therealso requires a regional approach — one that can bebest effected by holding the proposed internationalconference on the Great Lakes region.We reiterate our firm support for the Secretary-General’s recommendations to substantially reinforcethe troops of the United Nations Organization Missionin the Democratic Republic of the Congo in order tohelp consolidate the peace process in that country.The situation in Darfur has highlighted the urgentneed to realize programmes to establish an independentoperations management unit for peacekeeping withinthe African Union in order to facilitate the rapiddeployment of African forces to stem conflicts as soonas they break out.Conflict prevention can only be effective if wetake into consideration the disturbing question of theproliferation of small arms and light weapons  which isa dangerous destabilizing factor. The illicit circulationof small arms and light weapons considerably reducesthe ability of national communities to peacefullyresolve their disputes.The same applies to disarmament  which Beninconsiders crucial to the establishment of peace and thepromotion of development. We call for the total andverifiable elimination from our planet of the threat ofnuclear arms  as well as other types of weapons ofmass destruction.Since 11 September 2001 international terrorismhas become one of the great challenges of our time.The international community must condemn terrorismand combat it in all its forms with determination —attacking the problem with a renewed political will toseek a lasting solution to the serious internationalproblems that terrorism feeds on. We must  however remember that in prosecuting that struggle it isimperative that we preserve the democratic freedomsthat have been so dearly won by our citizens  and theopen society  which is the essence of democracy.Indeed  terrorism is not the monopoly of a singlereligion or nationality  much less that of a givencivilization. It is not the concern of one particularcategory of countries. It is a global threat and  as aresult  requires a global response. My country issparing no effort to join the efforts of the internationalcommunity in that area. It is in that spirit that wesigned and carried out the ratification of 12international conventions regarding the fight againstterrorism and organized crime.10We have all acknowledged the need for reform and for more than a decade have been involved in amultidimensional discussion in order to bring theinstitutional architecture of the United Nations systemand its operating methods up to date in accordancewith the changing realities the elements of the systemwere devised to confront.The ultimate goal of reform is to better serve theideals of the Organization and better meet thelegitimate expectations of the people of the world inthe face of the dangers confronting them today.With respect to Security Council reform  mostMember States have expressed the hope that theSecurity Council will become more representative ofthe international community as a whole  in the light ofthe considerable increase in the number of MemberStates — which have grown from 51 to 192 since thecreation of the United Nations — and in the light of thefact that the new States have a certain weightdemographically  economically and militarily.I take this opportunity to extend my thanks to allMember States of the United Nations that  on 23October 2003  voted for my country  Benin  to becomea non-permanent member of the Security Council forthe period 2004-2005.In the context of current discussions on SecurityCouncil reform  Benin believes that any reform of theCouncil must take into consideration the legitimateaspirations of the developing countries  in particularAfrican countries  while maintaining the Council’seffectiveness and good functioning.Benin has no objection to the friendly countriesof Japan  Germany and Brazil becoming permanentmembers of the Security Council. However  the extent the nature and the modalities of the increase in Councilmembership should be based on the principles ofequitable geographic distribution and the sovereignequality of States. Clearly  there cannot be a partial orselective increase in the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the Council that works to thedetriment of the developing countries. In that context Africa  like all regional groups  must have twopermanent seats on the Security Council. Any othersolution would cause a de facto disequilibrium and anoverrepresentation of one regional group to thedetriment of others. In other words  Africa justlydemands two permanent seats and two non-permanentseats  in addition to the three it currently holds.The right of veto should be extended to the newpermanent members of the Security Council. Inaddition  the non-permanent members of the Council in rotation  could be accorded the veto power duringthe month they hold the presidency  given theimportance of that position.The link between development and peace can beseen more clearly now than in the past. We are used tohearing those two concepts linked in the time-honouredsaying that “development is the other name for peace”.As national revenue grows  Governments have greatermanoeuvring room to adopt social and economicpolicies that promote national integration and regionalequilibrium.Today  two years after the World Summit onSustainable Development  held at Johannesburg  we allagree on the importance of the progressive andharmonious attainment of the goals of sustainabledevelopment  in accordance with the outcome of ourwork at Johannesburg. If the environment is important in no way can it be treated separately from otheraspects of sustainable development. Rather  it is byreinforcing national development capacity  whilesupporting the activities of communities through high-impact programmes such as microfinancing  asproposed by the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme and the Global Environment Facility  thatwe can wage a radical campaign against extremepoverty and reduce the number of people living inpoverty by 2015  as established in the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.Those programmes provide opportunities to helpus better protect natural resources. However  we willnot allow the protection of the environment to becomea limit to our country’s economic growth. Sustainabledevelopment  properly understood  consists ofintegrating all dimensions into a coherent nationalpolicy.In developing countries  in particular the leastdeveloped countries and especially Benin  where manyefforts have been made to reinforce democracy strengthen the decentralization process and fightpoverty  communities and non-governmentalorganizations must be strengthened to decentralizemanagement of the environment and thus promotedevelopment at the local level.Also to fight poverty and better manage naturalresources  we must remember that the Johannesburg11Summit identified the United Nations Convention toCombat Desertification as one way to fight poverty andas a tool available to the international community toachieve the Millennium Development Goals. When  atits sixtieth session  the General Assembly examines theprogress made towards achieving those Goals  mydelegation hopes that the Convention to CombatDesertification will take its rightful place in thediscussions on the Millennium Project  led byProfessor Jeffrey Sachs.With respect to financial resources  we call on theinternational community to make the fourthreplenishment of the Global Environment Fund evengreater than the third and call for the issue of soildegradation and desertification to receive all theattention it deserves.By adopting the 2001 Programme of Action forthe Least Developed Countries for the decade 2001-2010 at the conclusion of the Third United NationsConference on the Least Developed Countries  held inBrussels  the international community established thekey goal of doing everything possible to halve by 2015the number of people living in extreme poverty andsuffering hunger and to promote sustainabledevelopment in the developing countries.In spite of the efforts made  the least developedcountries continue to suffer from the burden of debt leading to weakened measures for social protection  theimpoverishment of vulnerable segments of society rural migration and the depreciation of agriculturalproducts  among other things.In his mandate as Global Chair of the Bureau ofthe Least Developed Countries  President MathieuKérékou of the Republic of Benin took part from 28 to30 June 2004 in the 2004 high-level segment of theEconomic and Social Council’s substantive session devoted to mobilizing resources and promoting anenvironment favourable to eliminating poverty  in thecontext of the implementation of the Programme ofAction for the Least Developed Countries for thedecade 2001-2010. The high-level segment identifiedreal ways to mobilize external and internal resources toeliminate poverty through microfinancing  thepromotion of small and medium-sized business andland tenure security.The least developed countries  in particular thoseof Africa  must strive to strengthen partnerships withthe international community  given that the prospectsof their national economies raise the most doubts.This year  Benin has again made its modestcontribution to international efforts by convening anAfrican Union regional conference on the family  in theframework of the tenth anniversary of the UnitedNations International Year of the Family.At that conference  Africa established an actionplan on the African family  as well as strategies for itsimplementation. The action plan is based on theobservation that Africa is undergoing three greattransformations and is faced with enormous challengesthat place increased pressure on families. In order tomeet those challenges  we must adopt an integratedapproach that places families at the centre of acomprehensive development programme to preservethe integrity of families.African countries share the conviction thatimplementation of the nine priority areas of that actionplan will make it possible to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals in the shortest possible time. Theaction plan has been issued as a United Nationsdocument. We urge our development partners to give itall the necessary attention in order to pool resources toimplement the plan  which can be considered asupplementary effort to better focus on human beingswithin their basic social milieu and according to theirprincipal needs  with a view to attaining theMillennium Development Goals.Encouraging efforts have been made in the areasof official development assistance  managing theforeign debt of heavily indebted countries andmultinational trade negotiations — in particular thoseundertaken in the context of the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development. They must be coherentlypursued in order to achieve an overall improvement inthe foreign environment for developing countries  ingeneral  and for African countries  in particular.I would like to take this opportunity to expressmy appreciation for the extension of the expiration dateof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative as well as for the adoption of the general Frameworkfor Establishing Modalities in Agriculture formultilateral trade negotiations under the Doha WorkProgramme  which is known as the July package. Thegeneral framework of negotiations on that documentwas based on the agreement of developed countries tobring domestic subsidies for their farmers to a level12that permits farmers in the least developed countries tolive off the fruits of their labours.In that regard  I would like to emphasize that  asfar as the sectoral Cotton Initiative is concerned —which should be the subject of separate and specialtreatment within a subcommittee — the developmentstrategy for the cotton sector could encompassidentifying market opportunities  the possibility ofdeveloping high-added-value activities and theestablishment of bodies or mechanisms that make itpossible to regulate and strengthen the market.I would like to conclude my statement byreminding the Assembly that Benin will assume thepresidency of the Security Council in February 2005.As part of its presidency  we plan to organize aministerial conference in New York on the theme“Thinking about the future situation of child soldiers inAfrica”. One of the objectives envisaged for thatdebate will be to help find lasting solutions to theproblem of child soldiers in Africa and to begin theprocess of developing an international legal instrumentto prevent the recruitment of children into armies.Through that theme  we will hope to engage theinternational community in a genuine alliance topromote peace  security  political stability anddevelopment in Africa. We count on the support andparticipation of members of the Assembly in thatconference  which will make it possible for us todefuse the time bomb represented by the issue of childsoldiers. I therefore invite all members to make acontribution in order to bequeath a brighter tomorrowto future generations."
"15",596,"BFA",59,2004," Thecurrent session of the General Assembly is of criticalimportance to us  not only because of the urgentquestions on our agenda  but also because of thedistinct honour bestowed upon Africa through yoursplendid election to the presidency of our venerableAssembly. Burkina Faso congratulates you warmlyand  in its capacity as Vice-President of the Assembly pledges you its full and complete cooperation so thatyou may successfully fulfil your tasks.I also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor Mr. Julian Hunte  who effectively guided thedeliberations of the fifty-eighth session.Our Assembly is meeting at a time when theinternational community finds itself confronted withgrowing poverty in the countries of the South terrorism and fratricidal wars. On the Africancontinent  we can certainly welcome restored peace inAngola  Liberia and Sierra Leone  but Africa continuesto be riven by many conflicts  particularly in Burundi CÙte díIvoire  the Democratic Republic of the Congoand the Sudan. In Iraq  an uncontrollable situation isgradually plunging that country into chaos  whiledialogue still seems to be impossible among theprotagonists in the Middle East. In the struggle againstterrorism  we must humbly acknowledge that we arefar from having developed an appropriate and effectivestrategy to eradicate that scourge. Killing and thedestruction of human life are on the rise in severalregions of the world.And yet  people of good will and internationalassociations and organizations remain mobilized tooffer solutions and to restore harmony. That isexemplified by the peace initiatives of the SouthernAfrica Development Community in the Great Lakes8region  of the African Union in Darfur  and of theAccra summit on the crisis in CÙte díIvoire  which under the sponsorship of the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  has revived a spark of hope fornational reconciliation in that country. TheGovernment and the people of Burkina Faso reaffirmtheir support for the Linas-Marcoussis and Accra IIIAgreements. I wish to reiterate Burkina Fasoíscommitment to joining any initiative aimed atconsolidating peace and stability on the continent.Peace and security are not the sole safeguards oforder and global political stability. In its ability tosatisfy the basic needs of mankind  human security isanother important aspect thereof. Ever since the 1995World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen the international community has recognized that thegreatest challenge confronting humankind is that ofpoverty. Poverty compromises fundamental humanrights  undermines the dignity of individuals andfamilies  and threatens the political  economic andsocial stability of States.Of what value is globalization if it ignores suchessential concerns of peoples as economic progress nutrition  health  education and employment? Theespecially alarming situation in Africa must be recalledin this Assembly: a feeble growth rate  an ongoingdecline in per capita production  a slow increase in theliteracy and education rates  the ravages of hunger andaffliction  endemic underemployment and a disturbinglag in science and technology.In the face of such a state of affairs  Africanleaders have undertaken to show more leadership in theformulation of economic and social policies. Theconvening of an African Union summit inOuagadougou on 8 and 9 September on employmentand poverty alleviation in Africa was an example ofthat growing awareness and new vision. In the courseof that meeting  together with our developmentpartners  we agreed that macroeconomic stability andsustained growth are necessary  but insufficient toreduce poverty. We therefore agreed  inter alia  to makeemployment the centrepiece of our economic andsocial policies and to strengthen cooperation betweenthe regional economic communities in the areas ofemployment  training and health care. TheOuagadougou conference also decided to establish afollow-up mechanism for decisions made at thenational  regional and continental levels.Africa needs the effective assistance of theinternational community to enhance the quality of itseconomic choices in order to improve the livingconditions of its peoples. From this rostrum  I thereforecall on our development partners to act along threeprincipal vectors. First  they must respect thecommitments undertaken at various forums to increaseofficial development assistance and to providesignificant debt relief. Secondly  they must establishrules to organize international trade on a more just andequitable basis. Thirdly  they must implement therecommendations of the report of the WorldCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization.Let us see to it that  in September 2005  as we convenethe United Nations high-level event on the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  relevant consideration andconcrete actions will already have been undertaken tothat end.For the francophone community  the themes ofsolidarity and sustainable development will beconsidered at the tenth conference of heads of Stateand Government  to be held in November in BurkinaFaso.We believe that the economic and social well-being to which our peoples aspire can be achievedwithin the framework of the rule of law. For its part Burkina Faso has resolutely opted for democracy  andour determination has been fortified through free andopen electoral consultations for some 12 years now. Weare fully resolved to embed democracy in ourinstitutions and in our society  convinced as we are thatit represents one path of hope for our country.The United Nations must serve as a guide in themanagement of international affairs. If it is to play thatrole successfully and accomplish its task  it needs to bedeeply democratized. In other words  it must listen tothe majority of States and civil society organizations soas better to serve the common interest.All signs point to the urgent need to reform theUnited Nations reform and to adapt it better than everto the legitimate aspirations of nations. Every State small or large  must assume its responsibility and beaccountable for decisions taken for the common good.Today  were the Security Council to growdemocratically and equitably in its representation ofAfrica  Latin America and a large portion of Asia andEurope  it would enjoy greater political and moral9resources to meet the challenges of peace anddevelopment throughout the world.Within the new United Nations that we sosincerely desire  the situation of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan will finally be resolved fairly andacceptably. Reason dictates that that country  whichcooperates with a large part of the internationalcommunity and makes a valuable contribution touniversal civilization  should be rapidly integrated intothe United Nations.With the valuable assistance of the Secretary-General  we have laid the foundations of a vastprogramme to reform our Organization. Thisconstruction must produce an edifice sufficiently solidto meet the countless challenges of the twenty-firstcentury."
"16",639,"BGD",59,2004,"Sir  allow me tocongratulate you most warmly on your well-deservedelection. I am confident you will build upon theexcellent work done by your predecessor  Mr. JulianRobert Hunte  and lead us to a very successful outcomeof this session. Special tribute is due to our Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  for his dedicated leadership.In Bangladesh  we believe that the UnitedNations provides an essential political and diplomaticframework for the actions of all its Members  includingthe most powerful. The use of force without theauthorization of the United Nations Security Councilcannot render the United Nations meaningless. We laudthe United Nations for its strong advocacy againstunilateralism in the interest of a just global order. Ourspontaneous endorsement of this principle is inconformity with the fundamentals of our foreignpolicy.The United Nations is not only a system forproviding collective security. It is also acomprehensive international network of systems. Itdeals with the work of myriad specialized agencies establishing norms  standards  codes and guidelinesand buttressing the rule of law and the rights ofindividuals. It embraces the world’s trading  financialand monetary systems and promotes the cause ofdevelopment. In our globalized world  there is nosubstitute for the United Nations. It is the only forumthat can deal with the cooperative management ofproblems that recognize no frontiers.The thirtieth anniversary of our admission to theUnited Nations this year marks a major milestone inour partnership with the Organization. It is a soberingmoment as much as it is one for rejoicing; for it is arecord of our progress as a sovereign independent State.From the very outset  Bangladesh pursued two pre-eminent objectives  strengthening responsibility at homeand enhancing our contribution abroad. Our relationshipwith the United Nations has been mutually rewardingin promoting peace and advancing development.Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman laid thefoundations of our national development in the late1970s. His philosophy embraced reinforcingdemocracy with development. Our achievements arelargely due to this pursuit. It reflects our commitmentto human rights  good governance and empowermentof the poor  especially women. Innovative ideasflowing from our own intellectual resources wereharnessed  with the cooperation and support of ourdevelopment partners and  of course  the UnitedNations system. A free press and a vibrant civil society32backed our efforts. The outcome was positive: it was toinvoke what the World Bank described as the silentrevolution that is Bangladesh. We are aware that muchmore remains to be done.Natural disasters have often proved to beimpediments to our development. The excessiveflooding this year is a case in point. Two thirds of thecountry was under water  and many lives were lost.Over 2 million people became homeless and ourinfrastructure sustained severe damage. Betterpreparedness prevented greater losses. The courage andresilience of the Bangladeshi people in facing thesituation were indeed remarkable. We deeplyappreciate the support and solidarity that we receivedfrom the international community this time.The peculiarities of our geography renderflooding a seasonal occurrence. It is thereforeimperative that we seek measures that will address thisrecurrent problem in a sustained and enduring manner through proper management of the water resources inthe region. In the final analysis  long-termrehabilitation and reconstruction measures also requireinternational support.Despite those occasional setbacks  we inBangladesh can point to progress in a number ofimportant social and economic fields. Povertyreduction has been a central goal. We have reducedpopulation growth by half  curbed child mortality by athird  achieved food self-sufficiency for our people improved sanitation standards with home-grownmethods  and reduced ozone-depleting substances andvehicular pollution overall. Education has remained amajor thrust of our Government’s policy. Our schoolenrolment rates are among the highest in thedeveloping world  particularly for girls. Free schoolingfor girl children  gender mainstreaming and theempowerment of women have helped create a vibrantand progressive society. In addition  ideas like micro-credit and non-formal education have made famousbeginnings in Bangladesh.We would be happy to share our experiences withother comparable societies  and the United Nations canbe an effective conduit for doing so. We encourage theUnited Nations in its role as a locator  collator andtransmitter of best practices. That is how the UnitedNations can really help developing countries  bypassing the litmus test of relevance  not in drafts anddeclarations alone but also in operations andimplementation.The past decade has witnessed many importantUnited Nations conferences focused on our criticalaspirations. The leaders of the world agreed on theMillennium Development Goals. However  the successof the Goals will largely depend on an enablinginternational economic environment  particularly in theareas of trade  finance  official development assistanceand technology transfer.Extreme poverty is a gross denial of humanrights. The disturbing experiences of recent years including the rise in senseless terrorism  warn us thatfailure in development is not an option  that povertycan breed extremism and that to rid the world of itstragic consequences effectively its root causes must beaddressed.In today’s world  trade remains a crucial vanguardfor development. Our active participation in the WorldTrade Organization and the United Nations Conferenceon Trade and Development conforms to that maxim.Unhindered market access and special and preferentialtreatment for the products of developing countriesshould be at the heart of multilateral negotiations.Managed migration is an important phenomenon.However  the root causes of cross-border migratoryflows need to be addressed in earnest.Greater focus must be placed on the fullimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Actionfor the Least Developed Countries for the Decade2001-2010. The goals of the Johannesburg Plan ofImplementation and the Monterrey Consensus shouldbe pursued with determination.While it is important to set targets  it may bemore important to create the means to achieve them.For the cause of development to progress  we need anenvironment of peace worldwide. Sadly  that is stilllacking in many parts of the world.We are concerned about the persistent violence inIraq. We are encouraged by the return of the UnitedNations to the scene. We now expect the UnitedNations to play a central role in facilitating thedemocratic process and in the reconstruction andhumanitarian work in that country.In Afghanistan  the holding of a successful electionnext month will be critical to the country’s stability.33Our people cherish their close bond of friendshipwith the people of Iraq and Afghanistan. We pray thattheir travails will be over soon.A core issue in the Middle East remains theunresolved problem of Palestine. The Palestinians havesuffered far too much for far too long  and the wallnow only exacerbates that suffering. Perhaps there canbe a two-State solution on the basis of the pre-1967borders  with an independent Palestine that has EastJerusalem as its capital. Until that is achieved  theremust be respect for international law  and all peoples inthe region must be able to live in peace and security free from violence  destruction and acts of terror.Wherever it has been possible  Bangladesh hasnot fought shy of contributing to post-conflict stability.We have always done so under the aegis of the UnitedNations. We are near the top of the list of participatingcountries with regard to peacekeeping. Over the past20 years  we have been involved in 28 United Nationspeacekeeping operations across 4 continents. Currently we are participating in 12 of the 16 United Nationsmissions. We have done so because we see this asadvancing our role and perception as a constructive andstabilizing international actor. We do not do it out ofconvenience; we do it out of our conviction.We believe that there is a direct relationshipbetween disarmament and development. Bangladesh isparty to all major international conventions and treatieson disarmament. Our geographical location makesnuclear weapons a direct and legitimate cause forconcern to us in the South Asia region. Bangladeshtherefore supports all measures  partial and otherwise towards arms control and conventional and nucleardisarmament.Bangladesh has condemned internationalterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Weremain an active coalition partner in the war againstterrorism.Bangladesh has been playing an active role inmany important committees and commissions of theUnited Nations. We believe that the reform of theGeneral Assembly and the Security Council that iscurrently being discussed can truly help re-energize thesystem and enable those institutions to reflect therealities of the contemporary world. Consultationsshould be broad-based and should not be guided by theperceived interests of a few alone. Bangladesh believesthat any increase in the membership of the Councilshould be based on certain criteria  including respectfor the principle of equitable geographical distributionand the aspirant’s contribution to international peaceand security  its proven track-record in democracy  itscompliance with United Nations resolutions  itsavowed commitment to nuclear disarmament  itsprofile as a major partner in development and itscontribution as a voice of economically disadvantagedcountries. Bangladesh believes that the ultimate focusof any reform exercise should be on enhancing theCouncil’s credibility and democratic profile through itsworking methods and its decision-making processes.The quest for world order must begin at our owndoorstep. Bangladesh is committed to maintaining thecredibility of the South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation (SAARC) to provide its socio-economicmandate and to reduce tension and create a broad-based climate of confidence-building. Bangladesh willtake over as chairperson of the thirteenth SAARCsummit in January  next year. The occasion will markthe 20th anniversary of SAARC  and we look forwardto celebrating the occasion with due solemnity as wellas maintaining positive and forward-movingmomentum. Our overarching commitment  of course remains poverty alleviation. All in all  we aspire toexpand our collective agenda for peace  progress anddevelopment in South Asia and beyond.I firmly believe that nations big and small  weakand powerful  all need the United Nations as much asthe United Nations needs them. It is only by combiningour endeavours and uniting our resolve that we will beable to achieve our objectives of peace  security anddevelopment.The power of humanity does not lie in the size ofits armies but rather in the strength of its ideas  not inits ability to destroy but in its capability to build  not inits tendencies to despair  but in its propensities forhope. Our ability to tap this power for our own benefitwill shape our future in these times marked bydifficulties but also possibilities."
"17",685,"BGR",59,2004,"I would like  onbehalf of Bulgaria  to offer my sincere congratulationsto Mr. Jean Ping on his assumption of the presidencyó a position of great responsibility. Given his greatexperience in multilateral diplomacy  I sure that he willlead the deliberations of the fifty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly to a successful outcome. I would47also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to thework done by his predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  toreform and revitalize the Assembly.(spoke in English)This is the first year that the Republic of Bulgariahas taken part in the deliberations of the GeneralAssembly as a full-fledged member of the North AtlanticTreaty Organization and as a State which has successfullyconcluded its negotiations on joining the EuropeanUnion. We are fully aware of the great responsibilitywhich we bear this year in discharging our mandate asthe Chairman-in-Office of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. All those factorsencourage Bulgaria to redouble its efforts in support ofthe United Nations. We shall continue our effortsaimed at strengthening the authority and role of theUnited Nations. We shall support the constructiveproposals for reforms within the United Nations  whichshould enhance its capacity and effectiveness.Today the United Nations faces new challenges which require resolute joint action and coordination.The United Nations and its bodies  as well as thespecialized institutions within its system  will continueto make an important contribution aimed at dealingwith extreme poverty and hunger  achievingsustainable development  containing and eliminatingviolence and human rights abuses and affirming therule of law  good governance and democratic values.International terrorism poses the most seriousthreat to international peace and security. This requirescoordinated and resolute action by all States and theentire international community. Nothing can justifyterrorist acts. It is essential that terrorists do not gethold of weapons of mass destruction nor distract usfrom our agenda  as outlined by the MillenniumDeclaration.This month the world remembers the victims ofthe terrorist acts of 11 September  marking theanniversary of those tragic events. We all watched inhorror  anguish and anger the cold-blooded massacre ofinnocent children and their parents in the school inBeslan. That is terrorism at its ugliest.Bulgaria  too  is firmly convinced thatinternational terrorism threatens all States and that itcan be dealt with only through joint efforts. It is forthat reason that the people and the Government ofBulgaria have whole-heartedly supported our countryísactive participation in the global coalition againstterrorism. We are committed to pursuing that policysteadfastly  even though we have suffered humanlosses and sustained damage.Within the United Nations system  the SecurityCouncil and its Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)are vested with the task of ensuring success in the fightagainst international terrorism. We share the view thatSecurity Council resolution 1535 (2004) and thecreation of the new Counter-Terrorism CommitteeExecutive Directorate have improved coordination inthis field. The Al Qaeda and Taliban Committee beefed up in 2004 with the Monitoring Group andSanctions Enforcement Support Team  should alsocontinue to wield its positive influence.Within the framework of the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  Bulgariahas been assisting in the joint initiatives of the CTCand OSCE and of the United Nations Office for DrugControl and Crime Prevention.The OSCE has been involved in several countriesin south-east Europe for many years now  and itscommitment to fostering peace and stability in theregion  through its field missions in Macedonia;Croatia; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Albania; Serbia andMontenegro; and Kosovo  Serbia and Montenegro  hasproved invaluable. Through activities such asinstitution- and capacity-building  promoting andsupporting legislative reform  respect for human rights and - in cooperation with the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)and other international actors - the repatriation ofrefugees and internally displaced persons  the OSCEhas made clear its comparative advantage in the region.But  while this work is essential  it cannot be doneeffectively without enhanced efforts by the internationalcommunity to address the regionís lagging infrastructure.The development of infrastructure and politicalstability must go hand in hand. The people of theregion are isolated from each other and from the rest ofthe region. Indeed  it can take longer to fly from Sofia toTirana than to cross the Atlantic. There is a desperateneed for highways  railways and infrastructurecorridors to bring the people of the region closertogether. Bulgaria knows from experience theimportance for the people of south-eastern Europe ofhaving the prospect of full integration into mainstreamEuropean political and economic structures.48Sustained efforts must be made by theinternational community to stimulate economic growthin that region and to offer young people in particulartangible hope for the future.Bulgaria has always regarded the stability andsecurity of south-east Europe as one of its priorities.Yet  in spite of the positive changes and theacceleration of the European and Euro-Atlanticintegration of the States in the region  the events thattook place in Kosovo last March revealed that seriousrisks and latent threats still exist. Bulgaria supports theemergence of a democratic  multi-ethnic  multi-culturaland multi-religious society in Kosovo. We willcontinue to cooperate actively with the United NationsMission in Kosovo so that this aim can finally beattained.Bulgaria is in favour of the full implementationof Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and itsìstandards before statusî policy. An agreement onthose standards  together with the forthcomingnegotiating process  will be decisive for Kosovoísfuture. We welcome the Secretary-Generalís initiatives and in particular the comprehensive review of thepolitical situation in Kosovo prepared by AmbassadorKai Eide. We will continue to lend our active supportto Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen  the Secretary-Generalísnewly appointed Special Representative. We hope thatthe elections next month will prove to be an importantstep forward in the context of the social and politicalprocesses under way and towards reaching a durablesolution to the Kosovo problem.Bulgaria is firmly convinced that the UnitedNations must play a key role in the stabilization andrestoration of Iraq  in the ongoing political andconstitutional process  based on Security Councilresolution 1546 (2004)  and in the preparations fordemocratic and free elections. We welcome the firststeps taken in Baghdad by Mr. Ashraf Qazi  theSecretary-General's Special Representative  as well asthe mandate of the United Nations Assistance Missionfor Iraq (UNAMI).There have been encouraging developments inthe resolution of conflicts in certain hot spots in theworld  such as Sierra Leone and Timor-Leste. At thesame time  there are complicated situations in otherregions  particularly in Africa. The situation in Darfuris of serious concern. Security Council resolution 1556(2004) and the recently adopted resolution 1564 (2004)must be complied with in order to avoid a repetition ofthe tragedy in other parts of the African continent  similarto the events that occurred during the last decade.During Bulgariaís chairmanship of the OSCE  wehave been making concerted efforts to spur and furtherdevelop cooperation between the United Nations andthe OSCE. We have been encouraged by the Secretary-Generalís specific initiatives  aimed at improving thesynchronization of actions  communication andexchange of information with regional organizations.We give very high marks to United Nations-OSCEcooperation in the western Balkans  the region of theCaucasus and in Central Asia.Contemporary geopolitical realities require notonly cooperation between the United Nations and theOSCE  but also cooperation with the European Union NATO  the Council of Europe  the Commonwealth ofIndependent States and relevant international agencies.In my view  closer interaction between them is ofcrucial importance to security  stability  democraticprosperity and tolerance throughout the world.The developments in Georgia have been followedwith close attention by the Bulgarian OSCEchairmanship. We have also been actively involved inefforts to avert possible crisis situations in theautonomous region of Ajaria. We note with satisfactionthe encouraging changes that have taken place inAzerbaijan and Tajikistan  including the decision of thePresident of Azerbaijan  announced in March  torelease 129 prisoners  as well as the June decision bythe President and the Parliament of Tajikistan toimpose a moratorium on the death penalty.The OSCE  through its outreach activities attaches great importance to assisting the normalizationof Afghanistan and its steady progress towardsdemocracy and respect for human rights. We expressour satisfaction at the fact that the OSCE willcontribute to the monitoring of elections inAfghanistan.In adapting ourselves to current geopoliticalrealities  we envisage building a bridge of confidenceover the Black Sea - an endeavour which can lay thegroundwork for future security  cooperation andtolerance in Europe  in Asia and the rest of the world.We are deeply convinced that the Black Sea dialogue isof special importance not only for participating nationsbut also because it can set a positive example for otherparts of the world.49Respect for and observance of internationallyrecognized standards of human rights by MemberStates is a prerequisite both for their national securityand for sustainable development. It is also aprerequisite for international peace and security. Theprotection of basic human rights and fundamentalfreedoms worldwide is a priority in the policy of theBulgarian Government. Our historical experienceteaches us that  in the quest to achieve prosperity andsecurity in any society  it is necessary to have not onlyan adequate legal system and mechanisms for itseffective implementation  but also a spirit of tolerance.We must not tolerate only one minority and ignore theothers. Anti-Semitism  anti-Islamism  anti-Arabism anti-Europeanism  anti-Americanism and even anti-globalism ought to be equally and totally rejected.Bulgaria welcomes the progressive reintegrationof Libya into the international community. However  mycountry believes that a compelling message from theLibyan authorities about their respect for human rightsand human values could only be communicated through ajust solution to the well-known case of the medicalworkers - six Bulgarians and one Palestinian - whohave been held behind bars in Tripoli and Benghazi foralmost six years. In this regard  we call upon theUnited Nations to redouble its efforts in the fightagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa  which webelieve is the cause of these tragic developmentsconcerning these seven innocent people.Bulgaria regards issues concerning women children and persons belonging to vulnerable groups ofthe population  including elderly and disabled persons as inseparable parts of the entire complex of humanrights. The Bulgarian Government fully supports thestrict implementation of the documents of the WorldConference against Racism  Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance  the twenty-seventh special session of the General Assembly onchildren  the World Assembly on Ageing  as well as theongoing efforts of the international community to draftand adopt a convention on the protection of the rightsand dignity of disabled persons.The measures aimed at revitalizing all theactivities of the United Nations are of extraordinaryimportance for the current session of the GeneralAssembly. The effectiveness of the work of UnitedNations bodies  particularly the General Assembly  theSecurity Council and the Economic and SocialCouncil  is fundamental for solidifying the all-aroundrole of this world Organization. The sooner we do it the better  and all the more so since next year we willbe celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. Let us hope that we will at that time be able tocongratulate ourselves on the adoption of these badlyneeded reforms. Taking all this into consideration andacting on the basis of the political will of all MemberStates  as declared at the Millennium Summit  we giveour support to the common efforts for speeding upUnited Nations reform and for strengthening the ties andcoordination among the United Nations  the BrettonWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization.The United Nations plays a principal and pivotalrole in the Republic of Bulgariaís foreign policy  asstated at the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly by our Prime Minister  Mr. Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. To this end  we shall continue ourefforts to promote the role of the United Nations andenhance its efficiency and organizational structure inorder to promote peace  development  democracy andthe rule of law."
"18",730,"BHR",59,2004,"Mr. President  at theoutset  I have the pleasure to extend my most sincerecongratulations and best wishes to you and yourfriendly country of Gabon on the occasion of yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits fifty-ninth session and to wish you every success inyour work. May I take this opportunity to thank yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte  Ministerof Foreign Affairs of the friendly country of SaintLucia  for the intensive efforts he exerted during hispresidency of the last session.I also would like to take this opportunity toexpress my country’s appreciation to Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan for the great efforts he has made toenhance and strengthen the role of the United Nationsin maintaining international peace and security.Since the signing of the Charter in 1945 in SanFrancisco  the United Nations has played a vital role inaddressing many international political  economic social and humanitarian issues.Our world today is witnessing the interlinking ofdifferent issues in politics and in regional andinternational security with other issues of development the environment  culture  women and human rights. Asa result  international interests have becomeinterwoven and the distinction between local andinternational questions has almost vanished in light ofthe spread of globalization. People need the UnitedNations now more than they did a half a century ago.With newly developed understanding  they have agreater day-to-day need to keep up with the moderndevelopments of the twenty-first century and the spiritof the age  led by multilateral diplomacy  which looksat both present and inherited problems from a newpractical perspective and understanding. The idea ofreforming the United Nations  including the collectivesecurity system  is indeed an ambitious one. However we believe that its implementation is not an impossibledream but a necessity. The international communitymust respond  through innovative thinking  practicalmethods and a collective determination  in order toachieve democracy in international relations  maintainthe spirit of the Charter  and devise practical solutionsto national and regional conflicts and mitigate theirconsequences for the development process in MemberStates.In that context  we would like to reiterate oursupport for the efforts made by the Secretary-Generalto reform the Organization and enhance its capacity toshoulder its responsibilities and carry out it missions.We look forward with great interest to the reportthat the Secretary-General will present in December onthe outcome of the meetings of the High-Level Panelon Threats  Challenges and Change. We hope that theseresults and recommendations will not only meet thehopes of the peoples of the world but will also besufficient to address the threats and problems that besetinternational relations on all sides.As reform and modernization of the UnitedNations have become a goal for the majority of itsMembers  by the same token  leaders and politicalexperts in many parts of the world  including the Arabworld  have become aware that reform andmodernization are important issues in their societies inorder to address the demands for change and themovement of history  and that these issues must beaddressed with clear-sightedness and wisdom  to meet25the hopes and aspirations of the new generation forprogress and democratization.As a result of that historic political awareness  thereform and democratization process has made greatstrides in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Bahrain has movedrapidly in the building of democracy and the wideningof popular participation since the adoption of theNational Action Charter by the people of Bahrain on14 February 2001  and municipal and parliamentaryelections in 2002.It is clear that the call for reform anddemocratization  which has become an importantcontemporary element in international policy  hasbecome a demand of both industrialized countries andof many developing countries as well. This year  thePresident of the Group of Eight invited His MajestyKing Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa  the King of Bahrain to participate in its annual Summit held in Georgia United States  from 8 to 10 June last  in recognition ofHis Majesty’s important role in the reform process andthe building of democracy in Bahrain.The phenomenon of terrorism is a source ofconcern for the international community  because of itshorrific spread to many different parts of the world.Indeed  no region or country is immune. In that regard Bahrain reaffirms its condemnation of terrorism in allits forms and manifestations  regardless of its sourcesor motivation. We reassert that there can be nojustification whatsoever for terrorism  and that terroristacts are not condoned by any religion or belief.Bahrain has condemned  and continues tocondemn  terrorist acts against countries and peoplesthrough which innocent lives are lost  and reaffirms itssolidarity with the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabiaand its support for all measures it has taken toovercome these criminal actions  which contradict theprinciples and tenets of Islam  a religion of toleranceand mercy. Bahrain also condemns and denounces allterrorist acts around the world  including the events atthe school in Beslan  North Ossetia  in Russia.In examining terrorism and its threats  it isnecessary to review its causes in order to limit itsdestructive danger. Among those causes  we findpoverty  ignorance  backwardness  unemployment  aculture of extremism  fundamentalism  ethnicprejudice  feelings of national desperation andfrustration  and violations of human rights.To address this terrorist phenomenon  and withinthe framework of regional and international cooperationto fight it  Bahrain and the other countries of the GulfCooperation Council (GCC) this year signed the GCCAnti-Terrorism Agreement  a further step inovercoming this scourge  which must be eradicated.Israel is increasing its oppressive measures andpractices in the occupied territories against thePalestinian people. It does not respect or comply withinternational law and international legality by takingareas of Palestinian land in its construction of the so-called barrier  which consolidates the occupation andthe settlements  and extinguishes hopes for anindependent Palestinian State — the legal andinalienable right of the Palestinian people.The international community today must take acourageous stand in the face of these actions  inparticular following the advisory opinion of theInternational Court of Justice delivered on 9 July 2004 and General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July2004  which represent a triumph for internationallegality and a clear condemnation of the building of theseparation wall  which contradicts the principles ofinternational law. The international community mustuse that opinion to pressure Israel to end its occupationof all Palestinian and Arab territories  including theSyrian Golan Heights and the Lebanese Shaba’a Farms.The Arab countries reaffirm their commitment tothe Arab peace initiative agreed at the Beirut Summitin 2002  and reaffirmed by the most recent ArabSummit in Tunis in 2004  which calls for a completeIsraeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab land and theestablishment of an independent Palestinian State withJerusalem as its capital  in accordance with theresolutions of international legality  in particularSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) 1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003).We call once again on the Quartet to resume itsefforts to promote the peace process  and we demandthat the Government of Israel fulfil its obligationsunder the peace plan  as set out in the road map.The situation in brotherly Iraq remains a continuedsource of concern for the countries and peoples of theregion  in particular the violence and insecurity thatthreaten it  despite continued efforts to maintain peace especially following the establishment of the InterimGovernment  which took office on 28 June 2004  andin spite of the transfer of sovereignty to Iraqi26authorities  the convening of the national conferenceand steps taken towards the creation of an interimNational Legislative Council.The upcoming stage requires that a vital andeffective role be played by the international community represented by the United Nations  which will bear theheavy burden of supporting the interim IraqiGovernment and helping it to fulfil the tasks requiredof it under Security Council resolution 1546 (2004).Bahrain has on more than one occasion expressedits support for efforts to maintain peace and security inIraq  and to create the conditions for the reconstructionof the country and the maintenance of its unity. It alsoreaffirmed its willingness to participate in Arab andinternational efforts to rebuild Iraq and to maintain itsunity  sovereignty and territorial integrity.The security and stability of the Arab Gulf regionis a matter of great concern to the Government ofBahrain  which is constantly seeking peace andstability in a region that has suffered greatly during thepast three decades. The Kingdom of Bahrain  which isa member of the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council  callsupon the Islamic Republic of Iran to work to peacefullyresolve the issue of the islands of Greater Tunb  LesserTunb and Abu Musa  which belong to the United ArabEmirates  either through serious bilateral negotiationsaimed at an agreement between the two neighbouringcountries or by arbitration.Given the Kingdom of Bahrain’s follow-up ofefforts to achieve peace and reconciliation and to re-establish stability in important regions of the Arabworld  we welcomed the Naivasha Agreement betweenthe Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People’sLiberation Army. We are anxious to see an end to thecivil war there  which has taken a great toll in terms ofhuman life and material resources. Bahrain alsowelcomed the agreement between the Sudan and theUnited Nations aimed at ending the bloodshed in theDarfur region  as well as the steps taken by theSudanese Government to implement its obligations inaccordance with the agreement that it signed with theSecretary-General on 3 July.Bahrain also expresses its support for the effortsof the African Union  which is working with theSudanese Government with a view to resolving thehumanitarian crisis in Darfur. We affirm theimportance of respecting the Sudan’s sovereignty independence and territorial integrity. We call on theSecurity Council to give the Government of the Sudansufficient time to deal with the crisis and offer thenecessary financial assistance to bring it to an end.Mr. Khan (Bangladesh)  Vice-President  took theChair.Today more than ever we are committed to theprinciples and purposes of the Charter. We now have adeeper understanding of the need for a modernized andmore advanced Organization that is capable of takingpart in collective international action  of responding tothe changes and challenges of the twenty-first centuryand of ensuring greater democracy in internationalrelations  equal rights among the peoples of the worldand equal sovereignty among States. It must also beable to arrive at solutions for problems that may occurin the future on the basis of international partnership so that any as yet unforeseen challenges facinghumanity in the coming decades can be dealt with.Past mistakes and current failures should notdivert us from our ambitions for a better future — afuture free from the scourge of war  a future of peaceand justice  where human rights and the dignity of theindividual are respected; a future where resources aredeveloped and where society can progress  where greedhas been eliminated and where countries cooperatewithin an advanced international order that promotesthe rule of law and disseminates the values of humanrights  generosity and justice  without prejudice arrogance or discrimination."
"19",768,"BHS",59,2004,"It is my honour tocongratulate you  Sir  on behalf of the Prime Minister the Government and the people of the Commonwealthof the Bahamas  on your election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I wouldalso like to take this opportunity to congratulate yourpredecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  of our sister CaribbeanState of Saint Lucia  for his outstanding leadershipduring the fifty-eighth session. His legacy is one ofwhich we in the Caribbean can be proud  and we wishhim well in his future endeavours.I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his stalwart defence of multilateralism andthe rule of law.Hurricanes Charley  Frances  Ivan  and Jeannehave ravaged the Caribbean islands and parts of theUnited States. Lives were lost in Haiti  the DominicanRepublic  Grenada  Jamaica  Cuba  the United Statesand the Bahamas. The damage to homes andinfrastructure and the interruption to normal life andcommerce compel us to stress the need for immediateand dramatic measures to ensure reconstruction andrehabilitation. What has been on offer to the region sofar is woefully inadequate.Our country’s northern islands — Grand Bahamaand Abaco — received double hits. First  HurricaneFrances struck on 13 September  leaving hundredswithout food  water  homes and power. Then cameJeanne  two weeks later  over the same islands thatwere hit by Frances  further exacerbating the problems.The Bahamas has many islands and  fortunately for us tourism facilities remain open in the capital  Nassau and facilities on other islands in the chain will beoperational shortly. That  unfortunately  will not be thecase in Grenada.Regional heads have called for an internationaldonor conference to meet the needs of all countriesadversely affected by the hurricanes. The Bahamassupports such a conference. We hope that  as a result ofthat conference  if not before  there will be a6moratorium on Grenada’s debt repayment. We alsorecommend that a regional disaster relief fund beestablished to support the reconstruction effort.The word “hurricane” comes from a word firstused by the indigenous people of the Caribbean region the Arawaks. That pre-Columbian civilization musthave seen the phenomenon so often that it invented theword for it. That means it has been around for sometime  and it is likely to be with us for some time tocome. It behooves us  therefore  to understand thephenomenon that we are facing  including itsconnection — if any — to climate change  which low-lying States have been warning about for years. Thesefacts also demand that our own societies should betterplan for the eventualities that have been  and that weknow are going to continue to be  a part of our lives.We cannot let lack of planning be a possible cause ofthe undermining of our sovereignty in this way.The world is soon wary and weary; thephenomenon of donor fatigue sets in. And we lose ourdignity if we cannot be seen to help ourselves. But if as the scientific evidence suggests  the hurricanes thatwe now experience are related to climate change  it isclear that we cannot defend ourselves alone. A majorshift on the part of the most active polluting countriesis required. They must shift gears if the people in smallisland developing States are going to survive. It is amoral imperative for them to shift gears.In this regard  the Bahamas welcomes thepreliminary moves by the Government of Britain  aswell as the Governments of Japan and of Russia towards putting climate change closer to the top of theagenda. We urge them to continue to use theirinfluence on their friends to cause a major shift inattitude. The implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Developmentof Small Island Developing States  adopted at theGlobal Conference in Barbados in 1994  becomes evenmore urgent. The follow-up meeting on this issue inMauritius in January 2005 now takes on even greatersignificance.In this context  I would also like to highlight theregion’s efforts to designate the Caribbean Sea as aspecial area in the context of sustainable development.We also reiterate our grave concern about the seriousthreat posed to the security and economic developmentof Caribbean countries by the trans-shipment ofnuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea. We continueto call on States involved in trans-shipment to desistfrom that practice.The scenes of death and destruction as a result ofthe hurricane that affected Haiti in recent daysreminded us of the political turmoil that that countryhas endured during the past year. The Bahamas extendsits deepest condolences to the Haitian nation for thetremendous and sad loss of life. The year  which beganwith so much hope with the celebration of the deeds ofToussaint L’Ouverture and the two hundredthanniversary of independence on 1 January  fell quicklyinto the abyss of despair on the fateful evenings of28 and 29 February. No one will ever know what trulyhappened on that night as an elected President left hiscountry with armed rebels nipping at his heels  but itfilled the entire Caribbean with sadness. It raised thespectre of mistrust of friends. That feeling has still notdied  but we must soldier on if we are to help thepeople of Haiti achieve democracy  economic upliftand a just and fair society.The Bahamas stands ready to do what it can toassist the people of Haiti in these developments. Haitisits 90 miles from our southern shores  and each yearthousands of migrants looking for a better way of lifeseek to enter the Bahamas illegally from Haiti. Wehave practical reasons  therefore  to ensure that justiceand democracy prevail in Haiti. We echo the call of allcountries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)for the return to democratic order in Haiti  and wepledge to help.We regret the failure of the Security Council toact in a timely fashion when Haiti’s friends begged forthe authority to intervene or to authorize anintervention. Perhaps that failure heralds the need forthe Council’s reform. The Bahamas supports suchreform efforts and awaits the report of the High-LevelPanel appointed by the Secretary-General. But theUnited Nations must never stop trying to address theissues that face Haiti  because there is a moralimperative to eliminate hunger  poverty  disease anddiscrimination. In this regard  we welcome the work ofPresident Lula da Silva of Brazil and President Chiracof France  Pope John Paul and other world leaders inseeking to ensure that the moral imperatives to whichwe have referred are placed at the forefront of theworld’s agenda. We must never forget what Haiti hasdone for our region and for the world.7While the fight against those who would subvertour democratic values by attacks on civilian andmilitary targets remains high on our agenda  we mustnot allow the drums of war to drown out the calls ofthe world’s poor and disenfranchized. In 2000  we gaveourselves a set of goals with respect to developmentwith a human face  and we must do all that we can toachieve them. The Bahamas has committed itself to thefight. We offer our heartfelt condolences to thesurvivors of all who have lost their lives in suchsenseless attacks  particularly in the United States Kenya  Spain  Tanzania and Indonesia. But we alsoadmonish all States that terrorism cannot be an excuseto limit freedom and to dispense with the very libertiesthat we are trying to defend and that form thefoundations of free and democratic societies.All States ought to act with caution in putting inplace rules and regulations for travel  lest the denial ofthose rights cannot be defended by logic or objectivity.That is especially so where we note that developedcountries argue in favour of free trade andglobalization but deny the benefits of that trade tolegitimate travellers by administrative discriminationand bureaucratic procedures and delay. The appealtherefore is to bring some sense of balance  before welose the very thing we seek to save.As part of this overall process of reflection  mydelegation welcomes the high-level reviews plannedfor 2005 of our commitments with respect to socialdevelopment and the advancement of women. We mustensure that we undertake an unflinching examinationof the progress made in achieving the priority goals ofthe Copenhagen Programme of Action and the BeijingPlatform for Action to determine how far we havecome and what remains to be done. It is critical that theoutcomes of the respective appraisals will acknowledgethe gaps in implementation and allow States and theinternational community as a whole to move forwardand achieve the timely and effective implementation ofthe commitments undertaken at Copenhagen  Beijingand beyond. We must also make certain that the resultsof our deliberations feed constructively andsynergistically into the high-level event in September2005  so as to ensure that no ground is left uncovered.HIV/AIDS continues to threaten to underminedecades and centuries of progress in health care and indeveloping healthy populations that facilitate economicgrowth throughout the world. The Bahamas is a leaderin the fight against HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean region.We urge the continued and unrelenting fight against thedisease  to rescue the world’s developing nations fromthe clutches of that scourge. It must take all of thepolitical will and financial power of the world’s nationsto ensure that the scourge is brought under control andthen eliminated.In that context  the Bahamas welcomes the recentgrant to the Pan-Caribbean Partnership from the GlobalFund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. Thatgrant will provide a much-needed infusion of resourcesfor prevention  care and treatment programmes. TheBahamas also welcomes the convening of the June2005 high-level meeting to review the progressachieved in realizing the commitments set out in theDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. TheBahamas acknowledges the pledge made by the UnitedStates to set aside $15 billion to fight HIV/AIDSthroughout the world  including in Haiti and Guyana inthe Caribbean region.It is an inescapable fact that there can be nomeaningful social or economic development withoutsecurity. For many of us in the Caribbean in particular that security is being undermined by the activities ofthose trafficking in illicit drugs  illegal weapons andundocumented aliens. By virtue of its geographicallocation  the Bahamas is an unwitting transit point forsuch illegal activities. In the case of illicit drugs  theBahamas is neither a producer nor the final destinationfor them. However  as a trans-shipment point  theBahamas  as do other transit countries  experiences theillegal activities associated with that trade. Thoseactivities tend to undermine the economic and socialfabric of our nations.We therefore welcomed the convening in June2004 of the first session of the Open-ended WorkingGroup to Negotiate an International Instrument toEnable States to Identify and Trace in a Timely MannerIllicit Small Arms and Light Weapons  some of thetools undermining our safety and security and oureconomic and social fabric. That meeting was a small but important  first step in reaching agreement on aninstrument on tracing  to enable States affected by thatillicit trade to more effectively identify lines of supply put measures in place to interdict existing lines andprevent new ones  and to cooperate with other States atthe bilateral  regional and international levels. At thesame time  we continue to call on developed countriesto take the same extraordinary measures they use inseeking to stop drug trafficking into their countries to8stop illegal small arms from reaching our shores fromtheir countries.The Bahamas joins with other countries of theCaribbean Community in voicing our concern aboutthe persistent attempts on the part of some of thedeveloped world’s un-elected multilateral bodies toexclude developing countries from decision-makingand norm-setting processes  thereby undermining oureconomies. Chief among those is the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development. Thedecisions of those bodies are not friendly acts. Werepeat the call we made last year about the need for aglobal forum to deal with those unfair practices.We welcome the work that has been done in theEconomic and Social Council to redress the imbalancein favour of a level playing field. The arrangements fordealing with international tax matters in particular area source of concern. We pledge to continue to workwith the United Nations towards establishing a worldbody that will deal with those matters in a fair andbalanced way.Yesterday I was in our capital city  Nassau  in theBahamas  where we marked 275 years of continuousrepresentative  parliamentary democracy. This  then  isa propitious time to reaffirm the commitment of theBahamas to the principles enshrined in the Charter ofthis great Organization  which will stand as a guidingbeacon as we continue to chart a rocky  yet crucial course towards peace  security and sustainabledevelopment for all the world’s inhabitants. Whileprogress may seem meagre  we must not be swayedfrom our course and we must remain confident that thebenefits of our activities and efforts will redound tofuture generations. I say again that  now more thanever  the world needs the United Nations."
"20",793,"BIH",59,2004,"I wish to greet you all andexpress my great pleasure at having this opportunity toaddress this Assembly. I also wish to thank the UnitedNations  once again  for everything it has done and isdoing for my country. Specifically  I would like tostress the importance of giving support to the returneeswho were expelled from their homes.Bosnia and Herzegovina is a multi-ethnic countryin which Bosnian Muslims  Orthodox Serbs  CatholicCroats  Jews and many other ethnicities lived in peaceand tolerance for hundreds of years. In Sarajevo and inmost other Bosnian towns  one can find mosques Orthodox and Catholic churches and Jewish templesthat have stood side by side for hundreds of years. Forthis reason  Sarajevo is called the Jerusalem of Europe.Preserving the multi-ethnic structure of Bosniaand Herzegovina  with all its characteristics anddiversities  presents an historic challenge  not only toEurope  but to the whole world. Bosnia andHerzegovina is the foremost meeting point of worldcultures and religions. It therefore refutes the theory ofthe clash of civilizations.I would like to update you on the situation in mycountry  which has made significant progress over thelast nine years.The infrastructure destroyed in the war has beenrebuilt and macroeconomic stability has been achieved with only 1 per cent inflation. The banking system hasbeen consolidated and foreign debts are being paid off.Since the post-war period  the gross domestic producthas increased three times over and national reserveshave increased 14 times over. Foreign currencyreserves and savings are constantly increasing as well.We are on the right path to meeting all therequirements for starting negotiations with theEuropean Union (EU) on stabilization and associationagreements. Due to the Republika Srpska entityísfailure to cooperate with the International CriminalTribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)  we havebeen unable to gain Partnership for Peace membership although we meet all of the requirements.Strong reforms are under way in the areas ofeducation  customs  taxes  security and the defence2system. Many new central institutions have been setup  such as the Defence and Security Ministry  theintelligence service  the Bosnia and Herzegovina JointMilitary Command and others. Compared with theapproximately 500 000 soldiers of the three separatearmies in 1995  the Bosnia and Herzegovina militaryforces now have 12 000 soldiers. The North AtlanticTreaty Organization (NATO) had some 70 000 soldiersin Bosnia in 1996  and the Stabilization Force (SFOR)now has about 7 000. The security situation is stable;the peace has never been broken. Since the DaytonPeace Accords were signed  not a single foreign soldierhas been killed in Bosnia. Instead of being a consumerof international aid  Bosnia and Herzegovina isincreasingly becoming a participant in internationalpeace missions  such as those in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Sierra Leone  Ethiopia  Liberia Timor-Leste  Haiti and others.The common foreign  security and defencepolicies of the European Union have enabled the EU totake the leading role in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bythe end of this year  EU military forces will take overfrom SFOR in Bosnia.The positive stabilization process - as well asthe overall progress made not only in Bosnia  but alsoin the other countries created after the dissolution ofthe former Yugoslavia - is being slowed down by aninappropriate attitude towards war crimes and warcriminals. Some public and political officials are tryingto find an excuse for the war crimes  saying they werecommitted in the interest of vital ethnic protection. Yetwar criminals are treated as national heroes. This mustbe changed. Only on the basis of truth and justice canwe build confidence and reconciliation among thepeople and friendly relations among our respectivecountries.The International Criminal Tribunal for theFormer Yugoslavia has an irreplaceable role to play inthat process. We deeply appreciate the work it has doneso far. In our view  it must finish the trials that havealready begun  particularly those of the highest-levelofficials. Some of the cases not yet completed can betransferred only to courts of countries where the crimeshappened. This can be done only when those countriesare prepared to guarantee fair and correct trials.Full cooperation with the ICTY must be anunavoidable requirement for accession to Euro-Atlanticinstitutions. Moreover  it is not enough to arrest andprosecute only war criminals on the ICTY's list. Localcourts in our respective countries must prosecutethousands of other war criminals who are still at large who constitute a destabilizing factor  who hinderpositive processes  and who are often connected withorganized crime.In my country  we are going to establish withinthe Bosnia and Herzegovina Court a war crimeschamber. The chamber will take over some of theHague Tribunalís cases  but it will also prosecute manyother criminals. It is going to be The Hague inminiature. We will therefore need technical andfinancial support  and we will have to involveinternational judges and prosecutors with experience insuch trials  above all those who have worked at TheHague Tribunal.Next year will be the tenth anniversary of thegenocide against Bosnian Muslims in the UnitedNations safe havens of Srebrenica and Zepa. Thepeople most responsible for that genocide  as well asfor all other war crimes committed in Bosnia andHerzegovina - Radovan Karadzic and RatkoMladic - have not yet been arrested. Those two menare responsible for the death of about 200 000 people.From this rostrum  I call on all in authority to arrestthem.The outstanding issue of about 15 000 missingpersons  whose bodies are spread among numerousmass graves throughout the country  320 of which havebeen found so far in Bosnia  presents a big problem formy country. We need help in finding the missing andidentifying them.The political system set up by the Dayton andWashington Agreements played a positive role inestablishing peace  reconstruction and progress in mycountry. However  they are now increasingly becomingan obstacle to further development and progress. Thecurrent administration in Bosnia  with a federationcomposed of 10 cantons  a republic and a district -strong entities and a weak State - is an obstacle in ourway towards Euro-Atlantic integration. It is anextremely complicated and expensive system that isbarely operational. The people  both in Bosnia andHerzegovina and outside  are aware of this to varyingdegrees.I believe the time is coming for domestic politicalrepresentatives to start to discuss the revision ofBosnia's constitution and its compliance with3international conventions. We have to create anefficient State with institutions and mandates that willenable us to become a full member of the EU andNATO. I hope we will get support and help fromfriendly countries and the international community as awhole. A good opportunity for this will be next year the tenth anniversary of the signing of the DaytonPeace Accords. It is time for Bosnia to turn from theDayton phase to the Brussels phase.Bosnia and Herzegovina is sincerely and firmlycommitted to strengthening friendly relations with theneighbouring Republic of Croatia and the State Unionof Serbia and Montenegro on the basis of mutualrespect for sovereignty  territorial integrity andequality. Our geographical location  history  ethniccomposition and economic and infrastructureconnections are leading us towards overall cooperation.We are aware that  without a resolution of disputedissues  we cannot proceed further to Europeanintegration; we already have achieved some progress inthis regard.The countries of South-Eastern Europe havemade huge individual and joint efforts to achieve greatprogress in changing the stereotype of the region as abackward  problematic and conflict-ridden area of theEuropean suburbs. Regional cooperation is beingpromoted in the areas of defence  security  bordercontrol  free markets  visa regimes  combatingcorruption and organized crime and the protection ofethnic and religious minorities.The issue of borders in the region cannot andmust not be opened again. We have to arrange suchmatters in compliance with European standards.However  we have to open the issue of cooperationwith respect to borders  since it is in our commoninterest.I think that the Iraqi crisis needs to be resolvedsimultaneously with the Palestinian issue. We thereforesupport the initiative of the Quartet and the road mapas a basis for setting up a sincere dialogue between thetwo States  with United States mediation. We alsostrongly condemn all terrorist acts  as well as executionwithout trial of Palestinian religious leaders. Westrongly condemn the Israeli side's construction of theprotection wall.We are happy with the consensus among SecurityCouncil members on the transfer of sovereignty fromcoalition forces to the legitimately elected legal andexecutive authorities in Iraq. We think the UnitedNations should take the leading role in shaping thefuture of Iraq. The Iraqi people need to govern theirown country  and the military forces that control theterritory must respect the Geneva Conventions andhumanitarian law. The territorial integrity andsovereignty of Iraq must be preserved  includingsovereignty over its natural resources. We call forprotection of Iraq's world heritage civilization and holyplaces  such as Karbala and the Imam Ali mosque inNajaf. With a view to helping the people of Iraq andcontributing to the establishment of peace there Bosnia and Herzegovina has sent a unit to Iraq todestroy mines and unexploded devices.My country is sincerely committed to combatinginternational terrorism and is an active participant inthe international anti-terrorist coalition. Terrorism isnot only a threat to peace and security; in our view  it isimmoral and counterproductive. It is immoral becauseinnocent people are killed  and it is counterproductivebecause terrorism cannot resolve problems. It onlyproduces new ones. In that regard  I would like tohighlight here the example of Bosnian Muslims  sincewe were the major victim of the aggression againstBosnia between 1992 and 1995. We managed to defendourselves  but both during and after the war we neverturned our hands to revenge or terrorism.Allow me to review the issue of Security Councilreform  as well as that of strengthening the efficiencyof the mechanisms of the United Nations. The citizensof Bosnia and Herzegovina know from their ownexperience what a lack of proper and efficient UnitedNations action can mean. If United Nationsmechanisms were more efficient  the aggressionagainst Bosnia and Herzegovina would not havehappened or  at least  the war would not have been solong. If they were more efficient  then genocide wouldnot have been committed in the United Nations safehavens of Srebrenica and Zepa. For that reason  I wantto remind everyone of the Organizationís obligation toassist the survivors in those areas.When considering the situation in the worldtoday  the question of efficient cooperation in the areaof security is inevitably raised. The Security Councilneeds to be the leading factor for peace and stability inthe world. It has to have at its disposal mechanismsthat can be operated with efficiency and speed in orderto prevent conflicts from becoming military clashes.4Among other proposals  we support the initiativesto enlarge the Security Councilís membership.Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to become a non-permanent member of the Security Council. In terms ofSecurity Council efficiency  our experience has beenmostly a negative one. Through our participation in thework of the Council  we hope to prevent a repetition ofour experience elsewhere in the world. Therefore  wetake this opportunity to confirm our intention ofputting forth our candidature for the 2010-2011 term.Bosnia and Herzegovina deserves that honour and weare determined to prove our worth."
"21",840,"BLR",59,2004,"Fordecades now we have been hearing very disturbingquestions from this rostrum: Where is our worldheading?  Where is the United Nations going? At thedawn of the millennium those questions are becomingincreasingly burning issues. The world has changed.The pendulum of history has swung to the other side.There is new violence  a wave of terrorism  local warsand ethnic conflicts  behind which lie growing povertyand a widening gap in development between countries.Those are not just someone else’s problems; they arecommon global challenges for all of us. What kind ofcommon house do we want? I believe that we primarilywant a safe house  where our children will not die atthe hands of terrorists or from hunger  sickness  anti-personnel mines  smart bombs or missiles.What  then  must we do? The answer is clear: wemust establish a valid system of international securitythat includes military  economic  environmental  socialand information elements — a system based on the ruleof law in domestic and international affairs. Theanswer is clear  but it is difficult to do it. During theAssembly’s last session  Belarus made the rule of lawin international relations the main focus of itsstatement. The fact that that theme has been a leitmotifof the present general debate inspires a certain hope inus  namely  that the goal is a realistic one.No right-thinking person can remain indifferenttoday to the heinous acts of terrorism that havecharacterized the start of the twenty-first century. Theusual approaches  based on selfishness and unilateraladvantage  are not enough to crush this evil. We neednon-traditional  long-term  comprehensive solutions.Who can provide them  and how? Only the UnitedNations  by playing its crucial role  can do so. TheSecurity Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee(CTC) must become a real  practical tool for curbingthe growth in international terrorism: strengthening theanti-terrorism coalition under the auspices of theUnited Nations  monitoring the implementation of theprovisions of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)and putting an end to the practice of double standardsvis-à-vis terrorists and terrorism.In practical terms  establishing a direct linkbetween the CTC and regional organizations andholding more open Security Council meetings at theministerial level could really help in the global struggleagainst terrorism  under the banner of the UnitedNations. However  such a struggle can be successfulonly if our common goal is to strengthen a just andhumane world system. Belarus will do its utmost inthat struggle.On 1 March 2004  the Convention on theProhibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production andTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on TheirDestruction entered into force in Belarus. We have theworld’s seventh largest stockpile of landmines  whichwe inherited from the former Soviet Union. We do notproduce or export mines; nor do we use them at homeor anywhere else in the world. However  guided by ourcommon concerns and interests  we ratified the OttawaConvention and are now counting on assistance fromthe international community to destroy our stockpile ofmines.Tomorrow we will deposit my country’sinstruments of ratification for such importantinternational disarmament agreements as theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism and the Protocol against theIllicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms Their Parts and Components and Ammunition supplementing the United Nations Convention againstTransnational Organized Crime.Today’s most important challenges include illegalmigration  transborder crime  drug trafficking trafficking in persons and the security of energyinfrastructure. In combating those threats  Belarus 16which stands at a major European crossroads  is asignificant factor in the stability of Europe. Ourcountry is also playing a major role in the Europe-Asiatransport of energy resources. Today we call on ourneighbours  NATO and the European Union to organizeregional cooperation to ensure the security of criticalinfrastructure  such as oil and gas pipelines and powerstations  including nuclear ones. Belarus has alreadyannounced its readiness to dedicate troops andresources to international structures in support of thosegoals. The contribution of Belarus to regional andinternational security  which began in the areas ofnuclear and conventional disarmament in the early1990s  continues to be a real and significant one. Weare grateful to other countries and to internationalorganizations for their assistance in the area of borderand customs infrastructure.Double standards are becoming an increasinglyimportant problem  and not only vis-à-vis terrorism.That objectionable instrument is being used primarilyagainst States that are bold enough to follow their ownforeign policy  rather than submitting to the dictates ofthe world’s power centres. A leader is not a dictator and certainly not a messiah. The practice of doublestandards today applies primarily to the Euro-Atlanticspace. But strenuous efforts are being made tointroduce it in the United Nations. That would presenta danger to the stability and effectiveness of the UnitedNations system. Belarus calls on all States that are notindifferent to the independence of the United Nationsand to the role it plays not to allow that to happen.Economic security is a very important conditionfor sustainable development. That is a very remoteconcept for most of the countries of the world. As theonly European State that is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  Belarus would like to stress thatthe concept of centre versus periphery pits developedcountries against developing countries in the industrialarena. It is also a concept that is clearly in crisis  andone that will slow us down in the search for a solutionto problems of economic development.Only seven of the 50 least developed countrieshave achieved a 7 per cent growth rate  which isprerequisite to halving the number of people living inabsolute poverty by the year 2015. One person dies ofhunger every four seconds. That is just a figure  but thevery banality of that statement does reveal themonstrosity of the problem and how terrible is theworld’s indifference to it. The difficulty of theundertaking should not stop us from seeking ways toresolve the problem of poverty. That is why Belarussupports President Lula da Silva’s initiative to fighthunger and poverty in the world.Despite the transitional period and the collapse ofour economy  my country — a large area of the formerSoviet Union — was the first to solve the problem ofmalnutrition. Now  we are waging a struggle againstpoverty. Since 1995  we have almost halved thenumber of people living in poverty in Belarus  with thefigure this year being about 20 per cent.The difficulties we have experienced have notstopped us from providing economic assistance todeveloping countries. We have unilaterally extendedtrade preferences to the overwhelming majority ofdeveloping countries.We are disturbed by a possible lessening ofUnited Nations attention to issues involving countrieswith economies in transition. Belarus regards the roleof United Nations programmes and funds as importantto the development assistance provided to countrieswith economies in transition. However  under currentconditions — in which some States of the region areapproaching the level of the Group of Eight (G-8) andothers have macroeconomic indicators that barelyexceed those of least developed countries — thatassistance must be carefully targeted. That means that in planning country programmes  account must betaken of countries’ socio-economic development andthe degree of their integration into the world economyand financial institutions. We intend to make thatapproach the basis of a draft General Assemblyresolution  and we hope that members will support it.The problems associated with financing fordevelopment are extremely topical today fordeveloping countries and countries with economies intransition. Last year’s two-day High-Level Dialogue onFinancing for Development was not enough to put inplace ongoing monitoring of the implementation of thedecisions of the International Conference on Financingfor Development. That will require an independentbody of the Economic and Social Council.Belarus believes that the 2005 New York summiton the implementation of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals will provide real impetus to all initiatives aimedat stimulating economic development.17Narrowing the technological and informationdivide between developed and developing countriesmust be our common concern.At the 2003 Geneva World Summit on theInformation Society  the President of the Republic ofBelarus  Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka  strongly urgedthe establishment of a trust fund to offset lossesincurred by producers who provide software todeveloping countries at reduced costs. The format andmechanism for such a fund should be defined by a taskforce within the context of preparing for the 2005summit.Having experienced the Chernobyl disaster Belarus is acutely aware of one fact: we cannotdisregard the problem of radiation security. Theconsequences are too enormous in scope  and tooincompatible with the long-term survival of the humanrace. The United Nations must not lessen its attentionto the problem of overcoming the consequences of theChernobyl accident. We support the work of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency to implement anuclear non-proliferation regime and to strengthennuclear and radiation security.Looking to the future to seek ways to ensurenormal living conditions for people living in areasaffected by the Chernobyl disaster: that will be thetheme of an international conference to be held inMinsk in 2006  on the sad anniversary of theChernobyl disaster. We invite all interested States  theleadership of the Secretariat and internationalorganizations to participate in the preparations for theconference and in the event itself.The United Nations has often been criticized.There have been many pessimistic analyses of its workand its potential. A great deal of that has been fair  butlet us look the truth straight in the eyes: there is noalternative to the United Nations as a mechanism forcollectively resolving global and regional issues. Nor isthere an alternative to multilateralism. The reality oflife convinces us of that more and more each day.Belarus looks forward with great interest to theoutcome of the work of the High-Level Panel onThreats  Challenges and Change. As a member of theNon-Aligned Movement  Belarus urges the Panel totake account of the consolidated position of thecountries members of the Non-Aligned Movement as itworks on its proposals to enhance the effectiveness ofUnited Nations reform.A key purpose of that work must be to correct theimbalance in the membership of the Security Counciland in the Organization as a whole  as well as topromote respect for the principle of equitablegeographical distribution of Council seats. We believethere should be an increase in the category of non-permanent members  taking account of the interests ofall the regional groups. We also believe in increasingthe number of permanent members  includingrepresentatives from the three developing regions —Asia  Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean —as well as from two developed States  from Europe andAsia respectively  that have made the most tangiblecontributions to the maintenance of international peaceand security.Let me return to the disturbing questions I posedat the beginning of my statement. Where is the worldheading? Where is the United Nations going? Theanswer to the first question must be that it dependsupon the United Nations. That is the main point. So far however  that has not been reflected in the worldsituation. That is a harsh truth  but the truthnonetheless. We must change that situation. We can doso. It is in our common interest and in the interest ofsmall and large States alike  as well as of both rich anddeveloping countries. It is in the interest of the UnitedNations."
"22",875,"BLZ",59,2004,"My delegation congratulatesyou  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency. Wehave every confidence that the fifty-ninth session ofthe General Assembly will enjoy success under yourleadership. We would also like to acknowledge thegood work of your predecessor  Minister Julian Hunteof Saint Lucia  whose efforts led to a new level ofenthusiasm within the General Assembly. In addition we recognize the tireless efforts of our Secretary-General.Events of the past months impel us to ponder theimportance of our Organization in the never-endingstruggle to secure a peaceful and dignified future forthe world. The United Nations was born to promotethose values that would unite humanity — values offreedom  equality  solidarity  tolerance  respect forpeoples and for nature — and thus transcend thedifferences of the world’s cultures. And so it is theseUnited Nations large and small come to find  in thewords of our Secretary-General  common solutions tocommon problems. And so it is that we the MemberStates must ensure that the United Nations is effectivefor our ends.In Belize we understand that and remain alegitimate partner in promoting principles such aspeace  the right to self-determination  social justice respect for human dignity  the rule of law  the right todevelopment and the protection of our environment.We stand for those principles not just because ofthe international instruments we signed  but becausethey represent the best way to end poverty  illiteracy hate and ignorance  to stop the spread of terrorism andto bring an end to inequality  oppression  and injustice.For the overwhelming majority in the UnitedNations  the solution to many of the world’s problemscan be found in the right of every nation to achievemeaningful sustainable development. Accomplishingsuch goals is not easy  but neither is it impossible.Challenges to development abound — challengesthat make us inherently vulnerable — and we as smallStates call on the international community to take intoaccount our vulnerability so as to ensure that policiesand measures relating to development correspond toour social needs.As a member of the Alliance of Small IslandStates  my country underscores the importance ofaddressing the special needs of such States through the18implementation of the Barbados Programme of Actionfor the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States. An international meeting  whichwill conduct a full and comprehensive 10-year reviewof the Barbados Programme of Action  will be held inMauritius in January 2005  providing an opportunityfor the international community  especially the bilateraland multilateral donors  to renew their commitments tothe Barbados Programme of Action.Of special importance to us all is the issue ofclimate change  and we must not flinch from takingeffective measures to address that problem; those whoseek to block effective solutions are creating conditionsfor insecurity that would dwarf the threats currentlyposed by terrorism.In that context  we remind Member States of theproposals first submitted to the General Assembly in1999 to designate the Caribbean Sea as a “special area”within the context of sustainable development. Therecent spate of hurricanes that have devastated ourregion — especially Grenada and Haiti — and whichcall for major efforts from the international communityto mitigate our losses  reinforce our contention that ourCaribbean Sea is as fragile as it is vulnerable and asfragile as it is valuable to our social and economicwell-being  indeed to our very survival.We call upon the Assembly to support us in ourjust efforts to achieve the designation of the CaribbeanSea as a “special area” during this session of theGeneral Assembly.In addition to addressing the special needs ofdeveloping countries  development policies must above all  be people centred. Coherent policies sustainable partnerships  sustained support andownership are critical factors for development. Thathas never been as clear as in the case of Haiti. In thewords of our Secretary-General “the international community failed to develop ...sustainable partnerships with the Haitian societyat all levels. The Haitian people wereinsufficiently involved in the development ofpolicies that could move the country forward. ...Financial aid did not bear fruit to the extentexpected because it was at times ill-targeted ...”(S/2004/300  para. 6).With the lesson thus learned  we have an opportunity toinfluence a positive wave of development for thepeople of Haiti.In Haiti  we also have a clear example of theinextricable linkage between development and security.There  threats and challenges to peace and securitynecessitate an integrated approach. My country hopesthat the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel onThreats  Challenges and Change will embrace thatapproach in its findings and recommendations.While we condemn terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations and have joined international efforts inthe fight against terrorism  we are mindful that ouractions for the preservation of peace and security mustbe consistent with international law and must berespectful of the human rights and freedoms of allpeoples without discrimination  foremost among whichmust be the right to self-determination.For that reason  we shall remain strongproponents of the right of the Palestinian people to asecure and viable State. It is also for the same reasonthat we support the Taiwanese people’s right forrepresentation before the United Nations.But what United Nations? Last year our Ministerof Foreign Affairs confined his remarks to an urgentcall for the United Nations to recall and enforce theprinciples on which it was founded  basic among whichis the principle of multilateralism — the mostfundamental conviction that led to its creation: thatStates  on the basis of sovereign equality  conjointlytake decisions that secure a peaceful and prosperousworld for all.Tragically  events since then have onlyexacerbated the problem whereby powerful States takethe law into their own hands and act in total disregardof the principles of the United Nations Charter andindeed of international law. If we do not act together toreverse that evil trend  we are walking — nay running — on the road to perdition.Yes  we support the call of India  Japan  Braziland Germany for a permanent seat on the SecurityCouncil  if there must be permanent seats. And to thiswe would add the equally legitimate right of Africanand Arab nations to be so represented. But the reformsmust go deeper. Why should any one country have aveto power? Why should millions of the wretched ofthe earth be left without an effective voice and be19powerless to change the world to a more just one? Andwhy do we  who so effectively acted to end apartheidin South Africa  tolerate the equally opprobriousapartheid practised by the State of Israel againstPalestinians in their own land  murdering andoppressing them without mercy and with impunity?The year 2004 has been declared the InternationalYear to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery andits Abolition. Slavery was based on an exacerbatedracism; so let us honour that struggle by implementingthe Final Declaration of the World Conference againstRacial Discrimination  Xenophobia and RelatedIntolerance  held in South Africa in 2001.Likewise we continue to support United Nationsefforts to bring greater visibility to the problems of theworld’s indigenous people during the InternationalDecade of the World’s Indigenous People. As theInternational Decade draws to a close later this year wecall for a second decade to continue the work achievedduring the first decade and so to carry out andcomplete the work that has not yet been completed.In our own community of small States  we facethe most serious threat to our peoples’ security  causedby the proliferation of small arms and light weaponsthat claim the lives of so many of our people. Thesearms come from countries that must be called upon tolive up to their responsibility to cooperate with us tostem the flow of these lethal weapons and to enter intolegally binding agreements for the effectiveregistration and monitoring of transfers of theseweapons of widespread destruction. An internationalconvention to achieve this must be put on our agendaurgently.Another major issue for our region is thecontinued attempt to isolate the sister CaribbeanRepublic of Cuba and to strengthen an economicembargo that has been condemned repeatedly by theoverwhelming majority of this Assembly. The entireCaribbean Community is at one in its resolve to engageCuba in a constructive and mutually beneficialpartnership that brings concrete benefits to all ourpeoples. The Cuban Government has  by its actions manifested its determination to fight against terrorismin all its forms and from every quarter. For us in theCaribbean  any call for “regime change” imposed fromoutside violates every principle upon which the UnitedNations Organization stands.Belize has its own cause to promote. The UnitedNations is well aware of the age-old and unfoundedterritorial claim of Guatemala  and it has clearly andunanimously called for respect for the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of Belize. We have endeavoured tonegotiate a just solution to this claim for decades  andin the last four years we have been engaged in aprocess under the auspices of the Organization ofAmerican States (OAS)  aimed at bringing thisanachronistic claim to an end. Agreements have beenmade and broken  in the context of a Guatemala thathas proclaimed its desire to find a peaceful solution tothe dispute. Still no solution is in sight. The worstscenario is for the claim to linger unresolved  thusaffecting the security and development of our people.We welcome the remarks of President Berger ofGuatemala before this Assembly on 22 September when he advocated a final settlement of the dispute along with cooperation between our two countries toimprove the socio-economic conditions of both ourpeoples. We certainly support this approach and will doour part  as we have always done  to achieve thosenoble goals. But cooperation does not substitute forresolution of this age-old threat to the security andprosperity of our people. We will  therefore  continueto work within the OAS to develop an agreed processthat will bring finality to this matter  which willundoubtedly redound to the benefit of the peoples ofboth Belize and Guatemala and contribute to the peaceand security of the region. In the search for bringingthis longstanding dispute to an end  we place highhopes on the role of the Group of Friends that has beenagreed by both parties to reach this objective  and welook forward to its greater input and support to theprocess.The challenges we face in the world today are notall unique to our generation. Some are the result of ourrefusal to learn from the mistakes of the past; othersare entirely of our making. Yet  if we are to look atthose values that unite us and we are determined in ourdesire for good  we will find that working togetherbrings us ever closer to amore just and peaceful world."
"23",922,"BOL",59,2004,"Onbehalf of Bolivia  I wish to express a concern that isglobal: the issue of terrorism. A world that is hauntedby terrorism is an insecure world  one whose prospectsare threatened. Bolivia believes that the fight againstterrorism is one of the most important tasks we need toundertake together. The incident in Beslan in theRussian Federation demonstrates how far it is possibleto go in brutal actions that are entirely divorced fromany sense of humanity.The fight against terrorism must also be linked tothe struggle against other scourges of concern to us all.In that context  Bolivia affirms its most resolutecommitment to the fight against drug trafficking  whichin our country is being waged through the eradicationof excess coca  undertaken with respect for the nation’stradition of consumption. That joint task could not befulfilled without the presence and support of theinternational community and in the context of sharedresponsibility. Shared responsibility requires clearaction to be taken on both sides of the chain ofproduction to eliminate the scourge of drug trafficking.Shared responsibility requires the social and theeconomic issues to be considered when addressing theproblem.Bolivia has elaborated the idea of alternativedevelopment  which we would wish to see convertedinto comprehensive development. In other words  theparticipation of the communities and villages wherecoca is produced in Bolivia should be part of thedecision-making process and of the design of strategiesto modify current practices of cultivation and togenerate reasonable economic options  to openmarkets  and to reduce the costs of intervention to theinternational community in the eradication of coca  andin particular in the process of seeking viable alternativeways for the Bolivian economy.We believe that the fight against the scourges thatare currently stalemating humankind could not bewaged without a multilateral response to the challengesto modern society. We firmly believe in multilateralismand strongly support the United Nations as the arena ofthat multilateralism. We are convinced that the timehas come to produce a series of comprehensive reformsin the Organization as a whole. That would require inter alia  an expansion of the Security Council at theonset of a new historic era. As the challenges havechanged  so too must the responses.In that context  we are convinced that anotheraspect to be thoroughly reviewed is the paradigm ofglobal development  which is unsustainable over timeand will not allow for long-term responses  but whichwill instead generate complex problems that cannot beresolved. A change in the development paradigmrequires openness of mind and a heterodox capacity torespond to the basic parameters in which the worldeconomy functions today  without demagogicresponses or utopian solutions. On the contrary  weneed to ponder such issues as hunger  poverty andexclusion  which afflict millions of human beings onour planet.This is a good opportunity to recall that  over thepast year  Bolivia has experienced a particularlydifficult situation. In October 2003  a social  politicaland economic crisis pushed our nation to the brink ofconfrontation and violence  with unforeseeableconsequences. The crisis threatened all of ourinstitutions  and in particular our democratic system.The Bolivian response to that crisis was issuedpeacefully  in respect for democracy  through amechanism of constitutional succession that allowedme  as Vice-President  to take office as President and toassume the enormous challenges to the country in orderto restore order  peace and the prospects and hopes ofour society.20Why did this crisis occur in Bolivia? It happenedbecause of an accumulation of historic arrears that  atsome point  had to be paid for by our society. Thosearrears included exclusion  discrimination  a vision ofBolivian society rife with racism  and truly dreadfulpoverty. The efforts undertaken by the country on thebasis of a liberal economic model and of a structuraladjustment model had their highs and lows. Positiveresults allowed for macroeconomic stability  butgenuinely inadequate results in the social sphere werethe outcome primarily of exhaustion and the need fordifferent responses. All of those historical arrears felldue in October  leading to a popular upheaval thatended in social turmoil  calling not only for a short-term response — ours  I believe  was effective in thatdemocracy and peace were preserved — but also andabove all for a forward-looking solution.What are the major challenges facing Boliviatoday in its geographical  historical and geopoliticalcontexts? It must first resolve its own conflict betweensociety and State and the challenges of its owneconomic growth. One of the country’s key issues wasthe definition of an energy policy once we learned thatour nation has one of the largest reserves of natural gasin South America.We chose a path that was difficult  yet attractive and that marked our desire for democratic participationand participative democracy — please forgive thewordplay — within our society. We opted for a bindingreferendum in which the people of Bolivia were able todecide what they wished to do with their mostimportant energy resources. The referendumhighlighted our will to participate and to define ourown destiny. It was successfully held on 18 July. Ittook place in a framework of peace  of democraticparticipation and of clear and convincing responsesthat allowed our Government to move forward with ahydrocarbons and natural gas policy that regulatesexport  industrialization and relations with investorsand investment companies that are appropriate anduseful to our nation.In this forum  I wish to affirm our belief in aconstructive and mutually beneficial relationshipbetween private investors in Bolivia and therepresentatives of the State. Perhaps one of the mostimportant lessons of recent years is that we mustneither revert to the old system of State capitalism ofthe 1950s and 1960s  nor pursue the rigid orthodoxy ofthe liberal vision.The answer for today is a practical combinationwithin the false distinction between the market and theState. That distinction must be abolished and thecombination made viable without exclusions andwithout jeopardizing the fundamental concept  inwhich we believe  that legal security is guaranteed bythe rule of law. That is the path on which we haveembarked as we work to adopt new hydrocarbonslegislation.Perhaps the most important thing for Bolivia inthe coming months  however  is to reach a new socialcovenant. While the relationship between society andthe State has been severely damaged and threatened bycollapse  it is clear that the concept of democraticparticipation has to be reflected in that covenantthrough a constituent assembly  freely elected to definethe outline of the country that we wish to build in theimmediate future.Given that my Government has no political partyor organized presence in that context  we shall convenea constituent assembly that is truly pluralistic and inwhich the elements of our Magna Carta will beprovided by various social sectors yet respond to asingle basic concept: an end to exclusion anddiscrimination; the option — in a country where themajority is of indigenous Quechua  Aymara or Guaraníorigin — for the majority to express itself; and thedefinition  in a democratic context and in theframework of distinct regions and distinct visions  ofthe profile of a viable nation.I also wish to note that we achieved somethingvery important after the crisis: the restoration of peacethrough transparent  honest and austere action thatBolivia urgently needed. This does not mean that thetask is done. The struggle against corruption willalways be a challenge in our country  as it is elsewherein the world  but I believe that we have demonstrated aclear commitment that has given us credibility andlegitimacy in our society.Transparency  honesty and austerity are vitalelements in a poor nation that must administerappropriately and efficiently the meagre resources at itsdisposal. In that context  I wish here at the UnitedNations to thank the international community  whichwas consistent and unified in its support for Boliviaduring the crisis and in the following months  helpingus to implement a consistent macroeconomic policy toresolve such serious issues as its heavy fiscal deficit.21Given its geographical location at the centre ofour continent  Bolivia should be a pivotal country inthe fast-paced process of integration. That process hastwo major protagonists: the Andean Community  ofwhich we are a member  and the Southern CommonMarket  of which we are an associate member. At first we were a “hinge” country  but we are now in theprocess of integration that will gradually encompass alarge bloc of South American nations  which wewelcome and towards which we are striving.In that context of coordination and integration Bolivia holds a key play in any process ofinfrastructure development. In energy  Bolivia is acountry that can serve as South America’s energydistribution hub. In telecommunications — fibre opticsin particular — and  of course  in highwayinfrastructure  we are vital and must be an actor thatfacilitates rather than obstructs.I wish to share a thought here with suchmultilateral entities as the World Bank  theInternational Monetary Fund and other organizationsthat are cooperating with Bolivia and other developingcountries.Because of its revenues and high level of debt Bolivia has been considered to be a heavily indebtedpoor country. In theory  that has given it a series ofadvantages in debt servicing and  above all  in thechannelling of that servicing not towards repayment but towards social services. Paradoxically  however this has limited the country’s capacity to obtain non-concessional loans that would allow us to implementinfrastructure projects that are of interest not only toBolivia  but to all countries of the region.We believe that we must begin to look differentlyat the way international organizations interpret thoseloans in order to make them more flexible and to avoidthe paradox whereby an advantage becomes a burdenthat makes development impossible. We hope that thisnew approach will be grasped by the internationalcommunity  and in particular by the multilateralorganizations.Lastly  I wish to broach a subject that we willalways stress in our statements before the worldcommunity. Bolivia’s landlocked status is a factor thathas curbed our development. Bolivia was born as anindependent country with a coastline on the PacificOcean. Today  we demand free  useful and sovereignaccess to that Ocean. Our demand has moral  historicaland legal bases and is linked to the high economic costthat has made development difficult throughout ourhistory. We make this demand  and I want to emphasizethis  on the basis of a logic of construction — a logicof integration.Chile and Bolivia are countries that complementeach other. We are countries that have a destiny ofshared development and integration. To fail to find asolution to the Bolivian issue is to negate thepossibility of development and integration and preventit from becoming a reality.Bolivia is prepared to undertake an open dialoguein order to find an appropriate and definitive solutionto the problem. That is all the more true today becauseSouth American integration is so close at hand  andbecause Bolivia’s maritime problem has become anobstacle on the path to that integration.We are expressing a rational  constructivedesire — a will for integration. Our demand isunchanging and has profound relevance in the contextof everything I said earlier.I should like to conclude by stating here  beforethe nations of the world  that our country is one ofpeace that believes in disarmament. It believes alsothat we need to reflect on and change many of theparadigms which in the course of time havecrystallized certain positions and have limited theopen-mindedness that we need today  more than ever in the twenty-first century  in order to face thechallenges of the future."
"24",969,"BRA",59,2004,"ThroughForeign Minister Jean Ping of Gabon  I greet therepresentatives of all peoples gathered here today. Ifraternally salute Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who5has been guiding the work of the United Nations withwisdom and devotion.For the second time  I address this universalAssembly on behalf of Brazil. I have a lifelongcommitment to those silenced by inequality  hungerand hopelessness. In the powerful words of FranzFanon  the colonial past bestowed on them a commonlegacy: “If you so desire  take it: the freedom to starveto death”.Today  we are 191 nation-States. In the past  125of us were subjected to the oppression of a few Powersthat originally occupied less than 2 per cent of theglobe. The end of colonialism confirmed  in thepolitical arena the right of peoples to self-determination. The Assembly is the highest expressionof an international order based on the independence ofnations.However  such a political transformation has nottaken place in the economic and social fields  andhistory shows that that will not happen spontaneously.In 1820  the per capita income of the richest nation inthe world was five times greater than that of thepoorest one. Today  that disparity has reached a ratio of80-to-1.The former subjects have become perpetualdebtors in the international economic system.Protectionist barriers and other obstacles to balancedtrade — aggravated by the concentration ofinvestments  knowledge and technology — havefollowed colonial domination. A powerful  all-encompassing and invisible wheel runs the systemfrom afar. It often revokes democratic decisions  causesthe sovereignty of States to shrivel and imposes itselfon elected Governments. It demands that legitimatenational development projects be renounced. Theperverse logic of draining the needy to irrigate theaffluent still stands. In recent decades  an ill-inclusiveand asymmetric globalization has deepened thedevastating legacy of poverty and social regression which is now bursting into the agenda of the twenty-first century. Today  in 54 countries  per capita incomeis lower than what it was 10 years ago; in 34 countries life expectancy has decreased; and in 14 countries  agreater number of children are starving to death.In Africa  where colonialism resisted until thetwilight of the twentieth century  200 million peopleare caught in an existence marked by hunger  diseaseand neglect  to which the world has become oblivious numbed by the routine of the distant suffering ofothers. Lack of basic sanitation has killed morechildren in the past decade than all military conflictssince the end of the Second World War.Love cannot spring from cruelty. Peace will neverrise from poverty and hunger. The hatred andsenselessness that are spreading throughout the worldfeed on despair and on the absolute lack of hope formany people.This year alone  more than 1 700 people havedied as a consequence of terrorist attacks around theworld — in Madrid  Baghdad and Jakarta. Thosetragedies must be added to so many others in India  theMiddle East and the United States  as well as to  morerecently  the barbaric slaughter of children in Beslan.Mankind is losing the fight for peace. Only theenlightened values of humanism  applied with clarityof mind and determination  will be able to counterbarbarism.This situation imposes a new sense of collectiveand individual responsibility on the peoples and theleaders of the world. If peace is our goal  it is our taskto build it. If we wish to eliminate violence  we mustaddress its deep-rooted origins with the same resolveemployed against the agents of hatred. The path tolasting peace must encompass a new internationalpolitical and economic order  one that extends realopportunities for economic and social development toall countries. It therefore requires reform of the globaldevelopment model  as well as internationalinstitutions that are effectively democratic and basedon multilateralism and on an acknowledgement of therights and aspirations of all peoples.The tortured look in the eyes of the outcastshould do more to stir our conscience than the no lessdramatic statistics on social inequality. Their gaze callsto us for a future of hope. Just as our destinies are nowintertwined  every conflict has global effects. When thesky is shown to us from between iron bars  let us notmistake the cage for freedom.We have the scientific knowledge and the scale ofproduction necessary for resolving global economicand social challenges. Today  nature and progress canbe reconciled by means of development models that areethically and environmentally sustainable. Nature isnot a museum of untouchable relics  but neither shouldit be further degraded by human and environmentalexploitation in a search for wealth at any price.6A generation is remembered not only for what itaccomplishes  but also for what it fails to accomplish.If our resources are so much greater than ourachievements  how will we explain to futuregenerations why we did so little when so much waswithin our reach? A neglectful civilization iscondemned to wither like a body without a soul.The exhortations from the great New Deal leaderFranklin Delano Roosevelt still resonate withinescapable pertinence. What is needed today is “bold persistent experimentation”. “The only thing we needto fear is fear itself.” Such boldness stems not frominstinct  but rather from political courage; not fromirresponsible wilfulness  but rather from a daringability to reform. What sets civilization apart frombarbarism is a political architecture that promotespeaceful change and advances social and economic lifeby means of democratic consensus. If we fail againsthunger and poverty  what else will be able to bring ustogether?I believe the time has come to state clearly thatfor us to once again grow in a fair way  an importantshift in the financial flows from internationalmultilateral organizations is necessary. Suchorganizations were created to provide solutions  but  byadopting excessive rigour  they themselves havesometimes become part of the problem. They mustadjust their focus on development  thus restoring theiroriginal objectives. The International Monetary Fundshould be able to provide the guarantees andthe liquidity that are necessary for productiveinvestments — especially in infrastructure  housingand sanitation — and which can also restore poorcountries’ capacity to pay.Brazilian foreign policy  in all its dimensions  isfocused on joining other nations in efforts aimed at theestablishment of a world of justice and peace.Yesterday  in a historic meeting  more than 60 worldleaders gathered to give new impetus to internationalaction against hunger and poverty. I firmly believe thatthe process launched yesterday will bring the fightagainst world poverty to a new level. As we advance inthis new alliance  we shall have better means to attainthe Millennium Development Goals  especially withregard to the eradication of hunger.It was in this same spirit of contributing to thereduction of poverty that Brazil  India and South Africaestablished  last year  the India-Brazil-South Africa(IBSA) Fund. Our first project  in Guinea-Bissau  willbe launched tomorrow.HIV/AIDS and its nefarious connection to hungerand poverty is also a priority. Our internationalcooperation programme with other developingcountries in fighting HIV/AIDS is now operating in sixdeveloping countries and will soon be extended toanother three.I am fully aware of the serious security problemsthat pose a threat to international stability. There seemsto be no prospect for improvement in the criticalsituation in the Middle East. In that and other conflicts the international community cannot allow violence —whether sponsored by States or by other actors — toprevail over democratic dialogue. The Palestinianpeople are still far from achieving the self-determination to which they are entitled.We know that the underlying causes of insecurityare complex. The necessary fight against terrorismcannot be conceived strictly in military terms. We mustdevelop strategies that encompass both solidarity andfirmness  but with strict respect for international law.On that basis  Brazil and other Latin Americancountries have responded to the call of the UnitedNations and are engaged in the stabilization efforts inHaiti. If we seek new paradigms in internationalrelations  we cannot shirk our responsibility to addressthe concrete situations that emerge.The promotion of equitable development iscrucial to addressing the centuries-old causes ofHaitian instability. In our region  despite grave socialand economic problems  a culture of peace prevails.Our continent is experiencing a period of democraticcoming of age  with a vibrant civil society. We havelearned that development and social justice must besought with determination and an openness to dialogue.The bouts of instability in our region have been dealtwith while strictly respecting our institutions.Whenever requested  and within its means andcapabilities  Brazil has made its contribution to helpfriendly countries overcome crises that threatened theirconstitutional order and stability. We do not believe ininterfering in the domestic affairs of other countries but neither can we condone omission and indifferencein the face of situations that affect our neighbours.Brazil is committed to the establishment of aSouth America that is politically stable  prosperous andunited  on the basis of strengthening the South7American Common Market (MERCOSUR) and itsstrategic relationship with Argentina. The possibilitythat a community of South American States couldemerge is no longer a distant dream  thanks to decisiveinitiatives in the areas of structural  economic commercial  social and cultural integration.Brazil is at work in multilateral negotiations witha view to reaching just and equitable agreements. Atthe last meeting of the World Trade Organization  wetook a fundamental step towards the elimination ofabusive restrictions that hamper developing countries.Coordination among countries from Africa  Asia andLatin America in the Group of 20 was decisive forkeeping the Doha Round on the right track of tradeliberalization with social justice. If successful  theDoha Round could lift more than 500 million peopleout of poverty. It is essential to carry on building a newworld economic and commercial geography that  whilemaintaining the vital ties to developed countries allows for the establishment of solid bridges among thecountries of the South  which have remained isolatedfrom one another for too long.Brazil is committed to the success of theinternational climate change regime. We aredeveloping renewable sources of energy. That is whywe shall continue to actively strive for the entry intoforce of the Kyoto Protocol.South America contains approximately 50 percent of the world’s biodiversity. We stand forcombating bio-piracy as well as for the negotiation ofan international regime for sharing the benefits derivedfrom the use of genetic resources and traditionalknowledge.I reiterate what I stated at this very rostrum lastyear: only an international order based onmultilateralism can promote peace and the sustainabledevelopment of nations. Such an order must be basedon a constructive dialogue among different culturesand world visions. No organ is better suited than theUnited Nations to ensure the world’s convergencearound common goals. The Security Council is theonly source of legitimate action in the field ofinternational peace and security  but its compositionmust reflect today’s reality — not perpetuate the post-World-War-II era or the Cold War era. Reformproposals that simply dress the current structure in newclothes and do not provide for an increase in thenumber of permanent members are manifestlyinsufficient. The difficulties inherent to any reformprocess must not cause us to lose sight of its urgency.There will be neither security nor stability in theworld until a more just and democratic order isestablished. The community of nations must give aclear and urgent response to this challenge. We canfind such a response in the wise words of the ProphetIsaiah: the fruit of righteousness will be peace."

Barbados was particularly pleasedat the election of a representative of a small islandCaribbean State to that high office in the UnitedNations  and President Hunte’s outstandingperformance was testimony to the critical and effectiverole that small islands can play in the multilateralprocess. His guidance of the work to revitalize theAssembly was particularly noteworthy.This Organization has been accused of being outof touch or  worse  irrelevant to the changing world inwhich we live  despite its valiant efforts in recent yearsto promote development  restore peace and maintainsecurity in many parts of the world. In thesecircumstances  it is incumbent upon all Member Statesto reaffirm their commitment to and support for themultilateral process  using the United Nations as itsprimary vehicle. At the same time  there must be aconstant process of review  reform and renewal of theOrganization so that it can remain relevant in thecontinuously changing international climate.Furthermore  it is essential that political will bebrought to bear on the seemingly intractable issue ofreform of the Security Council. Barbados continues tobe of the view that the Council must be made morerepresentative of today’s membership of the UnitedNations  as well as more transparent in its workingmethods and more democratic in its decision-making.The Security Council must earn the support andconfidence of all Members of the United Nations if it isto fulfil its important mandate in an increasinglyvolatile and insecure international environment.We must also recognize that reform cannot bekept merely within the confines of the United Nations.It must be accompanied by renewal of the widerinternational governance architecture. It strikesdeveloping nations as deeply unjust and hypocriticalthat calls for democratization and good governance inthe developing world are not accompanied by calls forthose values to be reflected in the multilateralorganizations by which so many are governed and uponwhich so many depend.Enhancing the voice and participation ofdeveloping countries in international dialogue anddecision-making is a fundamental prerequisite forimproving global economic governance. Debate onreform of the international financial architecture shouldnot continue to be restricted to the hallowed halls andboardrooms of the Bretton Woods institutions  butshould also find a prominent place on the UnitedNations agenda. We all have a stake in the globaleconomic system and its management. This highlycomplex and increasingly globalized andinterconnected world demands a radically reformedsystem of global economic and financial governancethat promotes equitable development.A majority of States Members of thisOrganization  both developing and developed  haveexpressed the urgent need for a transparent  open democratic and inclusive dialogue between sovereignStates on international cooperation in tax matters within the universal ambit of the United Nations. Thepersistence of exclusive and restricted membershiporganizations  such as the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD)  that dictatenorms and standards in international tax cooperation inlieu of an inclusive intergovernmental forum  isuntenable.While we are encouraged by the progress in thedebate within the Economic and Social Council toconvert the Ad Hoc Group of Experts on InternationalCooperation in Tax Matters into a committee of thatbody  with a new and expanded mandate  we still awaita final positive decision on the matter. We considersuch a decision to be an important first step towardsthe creation of an international forum to promote andstrengthen cooperation in tax matters.Barbados recognizes the critical need for theDoha round of development negotiations to be revivedwith a developmental focus  and welcomes the decisionon the Doha work programme reached by the WorldTrade Organization on 1 August. The concessions tothe least developed countries evident in that frameworkagreement are laudable. But while it would appear thatdeveloped-country benefits remain substantiallysecure  the framework severely limits the ability ofsmall middle-income developing countries to realizethe reasonable benefits expected and necessary toadvance their development interests.Trade is a significant factor in the challenge ofsustainable development  and trade rules need to takeinto account the vulnerabilities and the developmentneeds of small States. It is true that developed andadvanced developing country partners may experience9some developmental challenges similar to those ofsmall States. But it is the inability of the smalleconomies to respond satisfactorily to externallyimposed shocks which makes them particularlyvulnerable.Barbados appeals to all World Trade Organizationmembers to support the mandate given at Doha toexamine issues related to trade in small economies andto frame action-oriented responses to those issues  inorder to facilitate the fuller integration of small vulnerable economies into the multilateral tradingsystem.With respect to small island economies  some ofthe greatest development threats are those from naturaldisasters of every kind  including floods  volcaniceruptions  earthquakes and  especially  hurricanes.Indeed  in the course of a few hours  Hurricane Ivandevastated the island of Grenada. An economy hasdisappeared. For many Caribbean countries  this cycleof destruction is repeated year after year — onoccasion  several times in the same year. Some of usare constantly repairing and replacing infrastructure replanting crops and rebuilding our very lives.When a hurricane hurts one or more big cities orstates in the United States of America  resources areimmediately redirected to help those affected. Anentire state or city has never been eradicated. But thatis precisely what Grenada experienced just three weeksago. Can members begin to imagine the implications ofa small State being reduced to rubble in less than aday? Terrorists could hardly do a more effective job.Yet such factors are never taken into account whengross domestic product is computed.In response to this devastation  the heads ofGovernment of the Caribbean Community(CARICOM) met in emergency session and developeda priority programme for the rehabilitation of Grenada Carriacou and Petit Martinique. For its part  Barbadoshas already contributed substantially to the reliefeffort. But the reality is that CARICOM by itself doesnot have the financial resources to cope. We call for aninternational donor conference to help Grenada.In highlighting Grenada  however  we should notoverlook the damage done by Hurricanes Charley Frances  Ivan and Jeanne to the Bahamas  Haiti  theDominican Republic  Tobago  Saint Vincent and theGrenadines  Jamaica  the Cayman Islands  Cuba Barbados and the United States  all in the course of thepast few weeks.Such catastrophic events directly affect the abilityof many small vulnerable developing countries to fullyimplement the Millennium Development Goals andshould be taken into account by the Assembly as it laysthe groundwork for the 2005 review. Attaining thosegoals remains paramount. Barbados reaffirms itscommitment to their achievement and urges all Statesto honour the spirit and intent of the MillenniumDeclaration.The dominant view in some parts of the world isthat the most serious threats to international peace andsecurity are the recent virulent forms of terrorism  theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and non-conventional weapons  and the spread of transnationalcriminal networks. But for many others around theglobe  particularly those in the developing world poverty  the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases natural disasters  civil strife and other social  economicand environmental concerns remain the highestpriority.It is of the utmost importance that theinternational community strive to achieve unity ofpurpose in confronting these diverse security threatsand challenges  based on a common multidimensionalsecurity agenda. The Secretary-General recently statedthat the global security agenda should reflect a globalconsensus on the major threats to peace and security be they old or new  hard or soft  and on our commonresponse.In that connection  we eagerly await his report onthe work of the High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change. Member States must standready to make the necessary bold and drastic reformsof the current multilateral rules and institutions thatgovern international peace and security.For small island developing States like Barbados this wider multidimensional nature of threats tointernational peace and security is particularlyimportant. In addition to the impact of natural disastersto which I have already referred  the trans-shipment ofnuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea  globalwarming and water pollution all threaten our veryexistence as a nation. For us  challenges to oursustainable development represent some of the moreserious threats to our security.10In this regard  we place great emphasis on the 10-year review of the Barbados Programme of Action scheduled to take place in Mauritius next year  since itwill present the international community with anopportunity to examine past successes and consider thefuture challenges that face small island developingStates.It is significant that small island developingStates themselves have already implemented close to70 per cent of the Barbados Programme of Action. Wetrust that the Mauritius meeting will provide ourdeveloped country partners with the opportunity todeliver on their past  present and future commitments.Implicit in the proposal first submitted to theGeneral Assembly in 1999 to designate the CaribbeanSea as a special area within the context of sustainabledevelopment is the recognition of the marineenvironment as our most precious natural resource andone of central social  economic and politicalsignificance to the Caribbean. Its protection andpreservation remain a major priority of the region.This year  the General Assembly will return tothat issue. It remains the ultimate goal of the region tohave the Caribbean Sea recognized as a special areawithin the context of sustainable development  and welook forward to continued assistance from theinternational community in helping us to achieve thatobjective.Let me now turn to issues of particular relevanceto Barbados and the Caribbean. Barbados considers itan irony of tragic proportions that  in the bicentennialyear of Haiti’s liberation from colonial control  thatpioneer of independence has been plunged once againinto crisis. While the events surrounding the abruptdeparture of President Aristide remain a matter of deepconcern — particularly as they pertain to theconstitutionality of the removal of democraticallyelected leaders — Barbados is committed to assistingthe people of Haiti in the process of normalization  thesearch for a peaceful solution to the political crisis  thestrengthening of democratic governance in the countryand the provision of humanitarian assistance.Barbados is convinced that full engagement withthe interim Government of Haiti best serves theinterests of the Haitian people and reflects our stateddesire to accompany them at this very difficult time intheir history. This is a task which we must not shirk.Let there be no doubt: we expect the interimadministration to uphold the highest standards set bythe Charter of Civil Society for the CaribbeanCommunity and to fulfil its commitment as regards therule of law  equal justice for all  democracy and goodgovernance. We look forward to the fullimplementation of resolution 2058 (XXXIV-0/04) ofthe Organization of American States on thestrengthening of democracy in Haiti  as well as to theholding of municipal  national and presidentialelections in 2005  as promised. In this regard  Barbadosintends to play its part in international efforts to assistHaiti to put the electoral process in place.Barbados is hopeful that CARICOM will be ableto play a key role in assisting Haiti through theSecurity Council-mandated United NationsStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). In thisregard  the CARICOM Special Envoy  supported by atask force  has begun work to coordinate assistance toHaiti in areas where the countries of the region haverecognized capacity.Over the past week  we have all been made awareof the perilous situation confronting our brothers andsisters in Haiti as a result of the devastation caused byTropical Storm Jeanne. Haiti is part of our CARICOMfamily. It is our duty to galvanize all our energies toassist in mitigating the plight of the Haitian people.Two days ago  the Prime Minister of Barbados the Honourable Owen Arthur  announced that theGovernment will provide technical assistance  as wellas an initial contribution of 1 million Barbados dollars to the interim Administration for the purpose ofproviding humanitarian assistance to the people ofHaiti in the wake of Hurricane Jeanne.The issue of Cuba’s isolation within thehemisphere is also of concern to Barbados. Weembrace Cuba as a bona fide sister State in theCaribbean region and are committed to a policy ofconstructive engagement with its Government andpeople. We do not believe that efforts to isolate Cuba through exclusion from participation in hemisphericbodies such as the Organization of American Statesand the emerging free trade area of the Americas andmeasures that create greater hardship for the Cubanpeople such as the 50-year-long economic embargowill foster change in Cuba.Like the entire Caribbean Community  Barbados in its engagement with Cuba  has held close to theprinciples enshrined in the CARICOM Charter of Civil11Society. We cannot accept that a regime changeexogenously imposed upon the people of Cuba could inany way be a viable option.The Government of Barbados has long enjoyed awarm relationship with its Caribbean neighbourVenezuela and has been deeply concerned by thepolitical crisis in that country. We are satisfied that therecent referendum has been safely and successfullycompleted. We now look forward to a period of calm inwhich the process of healing and dialogue — necessaryfor better understanding between competing groups —can occur. Venezuela needs all of its people workingtogether if it is to move forward and continue to be aleading engine of development in the hemisphere andthe beacon of democracy which its founding fatherintended. It behoves all who cherish democracy to dowhat we can to give Venezuelans that opportunity.This year  the world commemorates the struggleagainst slavery and its abolition  with the goal ofdeepening knowledge of slavery and the slave tradeand highlighting its philosophical  political and legallegacy. As the first landfall upon crossing the AtlanticOcean  Barbados was the recipient of a large number ofAfrican slaves  leading to a major imprint of Africancultures on the formation of the Barbadian society.That coincidence of history not only created the uniquefraternal bond that characterizes the relationshipbetween the Caribbean and Africa but also serves tomake us uniquely aware of the interactions that theslave trade generated throughout the world among thedifferent peoples involved.Barbados supports the call of the Director-General of the United Nations Educational  Scientificand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for all peoplesto eradicate through their actions the vestiges ofslavery and to combat all new forms of servitude thatrepresent intolerable violations of human rights andfundamental freedoms. Indeed  Barbados asserts thatinternational peace and security can best be achievedthrough the building of tolerance based on recognitionof cultural  racial and religious diversity.The fifty-ninth session of the General Assemblyhas before it a number of issues that have the potentialto shape the nature and direction of internationalrelations for many years to come. Barbados intends toplay an active role in its deliberations."
"26",1045,"BRN",59,2004,"Iwould like to extend my warmest congratulations toyou  Sir  on your election as the President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Mydelegation wishes to assure you of its full support andcooperation during your tenure of office. I also expressmy appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte for his leadership and tireless work over the past year.I also extend my appreciation to Mr. Kofi Annanand his staff for their continuous hard work andcommitment. The Secretary-General’s personaldedication and leadership in the work of the UnitedNations  especially his efforts for global peace andstability  are an inspiration to us all. Those efforts areall the more necessary in the light of what many of ushere have described as disturbing world developments.On behalf of the Government of BruneiDarussalam  I wish to extend our sympathy andcondolences to the Governments and the peoples of theUnited States and the Caribbean countries for thedevastation caused by the recent hurricanes.Since its establishment 59 years ago  the UnitedNations has achieved much  especially in ensuringinternational peace and security and creating a stableand prosperous world. There has not been a world warsince its inception  and it has had a positive impact inmany fields  such as peacekeeping  the eradication ofvarious diseases and socio-economic development. Wehighly commend those efforts and value the sacrificesof those involved.However  the achievements of the United Nationshave been undermined by increasingly complexinternational developments. In his annual report on thework of the Organization (A/59/1)  the Secretary-7General stated that the United Nations has beenthrough an extraordinarily challenging year. It was theyear in which the Iraq war brought the debate on theUnited Nations role into sharper focus.Moreover  our Organization is still preoccupiedwith many unresolved issues. Among others  thePalestinian conflict remains a grave concern. Terrorismand weapons of mass destruction continue to poseserious threats. At the same time  poverty environmental degradation and the spread of diseasecause further misery and hardship for millions. Thoseissues demand our effective response  which willultimately define the relevance of our Organization.We therefore need more than ever a strong andeffective United Nations  one that is able to promoteworld peace and development. It must also give hopeand purpose to the people who increasingly look to itto improve their lives.However  the United Nations cannot do all thaton its own. For it to carry out its responsibilitieseffectively  Member States need to work together contribute resources and honour their commitments. Aswe work collectively to meet today’s complexchallenges  we must continue to adhere to theprinciples enshrined in the Charter. All the variousconventions and treaties  from nuclear non-proliferation to environmental conservation  aremanifestations of how we and the United Nations aimto protect our people and ensure that they can live totheir fullest potential. In that regard  I wish tocongratulate the Secretary-General for his address tothe General Assembly  in which he emphasized theimportance of those issues. It is through ourreaffirmation of the Charter’s principles that we caneffectively uphold human ideals  enhance security andstability and promote sustainable development.Without doubt  the United Nations is the mostuniversal international body for providing amultilateral response. We need to reform the UnitedNations urgently so that it can be better equipped. Inthat regard  Brunei Darussalam fully supports theSecretary-General’s efforts to strengthen and revitalizethe United Nations. In particular  we welcome the workof the High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges andChange  which he has set up to address this.We believe that United Nations reform should becomprehensive and include an expanded and morerepresentative Security Council  a revitalized role forthe General Assembly and better coordination amongUnited Nations agencies. The interest a number ofcountries have shown in serving as permanentmembers of the Security Council is a clear indicationof the desire for change.Next year  the Assembly will consider the reportof the High-level Panel and the recommendations ofthe Secretary-General. I realize how difficult it is tofind a solution that is acceptable to all  but it isincumbent upon Member States to make a differenceby implementing the much-needed reforms. Thus  awillingness to find a balanced set of proposals will benecessary. We look forward to the report  which hopefully  will make the necessary bold and realisticproposals in order to end the decade-long debate onthis issue.Next year will be a critical time for us as wereview implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. To ensure that the commitmentsset forth in the Millennium Declaration areimplemented on schedule  we must act without delay.As for Brunei Darussalam  we are doing our part toachieve those goals.As we begin to look into our agenda for thissession  we must remain focused on the issuesaffecting many innocent lives in Palestine. Recentdevelopments  such as the illegal construction of thewall in the occupied Palestinian territories  must bestopped and reversed. The advisory opinion of theInternational Court of Justice and the subsequentGeneral Assembly resolution ES-10/15 reflect theinternational community’s overwhelming support forending injustice in the occupied territories.The concerned parties must do all they can toprevent the situation from deteriorating. They mustmake serious efforts to honour their obligations asoutlined in the road map. It is critical that progressshould be made so that we can find a comprehensive just and durable solution to that longstanding conflict.The situation in other parts of the Middle East such as Iraq  has created enormous anxiety. Weacknowledge the central role of the United Nations andthe efforts of other countries and parties in addressingthe political and humanitarian dimensions of theproblems.In our region  we recognize that the nuclear issueon the Korean peninsula has a serious impact on thepeace  stability and security of the Asian-Pacificregion. We appreciate the role of China  theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea  Japan  theRepublic of Korea  Russia and the United States in8seeking a solution through dialogue in the six-partytalks. It is important that all parties concerned continuetheir efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the issue.We are deeply saddened by the horrifying scenesof harm inflicted upon innocent people by terroristacts. Brunei Darussalam would like to convey its greatsympathy to the Governments and the peoples of thecountries in Asia  the Middle East and Europe thathave been targeted by terrorist attacks in the past year.We strongly condemn those atrocious acts.Terrorism affects all of us — women and men adults and children  developed and developingcountries. It knows no boundaries. It has no ethnic racial or religious affinities. Despite concerted efforts devastating incidents this year have heightened thethreats and challenges posed by terrorism. Those actsare becoming more complex  and our fight againstthem is far from over. It is therefore important toaddress this problem in a comprehensive manner. Indoing so  we need to identify this problem’s real sourceand root causes. This is what we have to bear in mindif we are to achieve a long-term solution. At the sametime  we must not allow terrorists to divide us andundermine our determination to fight this menacecollectively.The challenges that we face require us to moveforward to ensure that the United Nations continues toplay its pivotal role. I am confident  Mr. President  thatunder your able leadership  the General Assembly willachieve success and make the decisions necessary tofulfil the hopes and expectations of the peoples itrepresents. Our tasks are great  but so also are ourcapabilities when we all work together."
"27",1086,"BTN",59,2004,"On behalf of thedelegation of Bhutan  allow me to congratulate you Sir  on your election to your important post. I assureyou of my delegation’s support and cooperation as youguide the work of this important body for the year. Weare confident that  with your vast experience and ableleadership  our deliberations will be productive. May Icommend Mr. Julian R. Hunte for his stewardship andcontribution to the work of the fifty-eighth session ofthe General Assembly.The task before the fifty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly is daunting  given the array ofissues and challenges facing the internationalcommunity. Among them is the issue of reform of theUnited Nations. In that regard  the General Assembly’sresolutions on the revitalization of its work and thereform initiatives in other organs and agencies aretimely and welcome  as they will serve to ensure theUnited Nations continued relevance and effectivenessin a rapidly changing world. My delegation looksforward to the recommendations of the High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change set up by theSecretary-General to examine the current challenges topeace and security.Much of the ongoing debate on United Nationsreforms has justifiably centred on the reform of theSecurity Council as the organ charged with the9maintenance of international peace and security. In aworld torn by old and new conflicts  the SecurityCouncil must evolve in order to remain effective and toenjoy the confidence of all member States. Itscomposition must change to reflect the widermembership of the United Nations and the newgeopolitical and economic realities of the present-dayworld. Bhutan supports the call for an expandedSecurity Council through increased membership ofboth the permanent and non-permanent categories.Among others  Bhutan strongly believes that India andJapan  in view of the important roles they play ininternational affairs  are pre-eminently qualified forpermanent membership in an expanded Council.The toll of innocent human beings falling prey toterrorism continues to mount by the day. Gruesomeacts of terrorism in different regions of the world including the recent brutal killing of schoolchildren inBeslan and the cold-blooded murder of Nepalese andother innocent people in Iraq and elsewhere  haveraised the level of horror to new heights. We stronglycondemn those senseless killings. Even my country hasnot been spared the scourge. Having exhausted allpeaceful means to prevail upon the heavily armedforeign militant groups from north-eastern India toleave our territory  the Royal Government wascompelled to use force to remove them in mid-December 2003. Most recently  two people were killedand 27 injured by a bomb blast in a marketplace in aborder town in southern Bhutan.There is an urgent need to take concerted actionto fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.Every nation gathered here  by having signed theCharter of the United Nations  ascribes to the universalcode that the methods which terrorists employ toachieve their aims  especially the targeting and killingof innocent civilians  cannot be justified.Conflicts and crisis situations continue to disruptthe political stability  security and socio-economicwell-being of millions around the world. Many suchconflicts are fuelled by conditions of poverty andunderdevelopment. Recognizing that interrelationship the international community has taken numerousinitiatives in recent years. Several major conferenceshave been convened  including the MillenniumSummit  that have provided a comprehensive set oftime-bound targets to be achieved in order to secure amore peaceful  prosperous and just world.However  those targets remain distant for manyand the gap between the rich and the poor is gettingwider among and within nations. The GlobalMonitoring Report 2004 of the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund indicates that economicgrowth in many developing countries remains belowthe level considered necessary to reach the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. If the Goals are to be achieved bythe target date  the report states  all parties urgentlyneed to do much more. The Monterrey Consensusreinforced the objectives of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and emphasized the roles of allparties involved in the process of financing fordevelopment. While developing countries have toaccelerate reforms  developed countries must providemore aid  foreign direct investment  debt relief andmore open access to their markets.It is against that background that my delegationwelcomes the 2005 high-level plenary meeting toreview the integrated follow-up and implementation ofthe outcomes of the United Nations conferences andsummits. My delegation hopes that the review will leadto further concrete action by all stakeholders.Furthermore  as a landlocked  least developed country my delegation hopes to see the issues and challengesidentified in the Almaty and Brussels Programmes ofAction receive the highest priority during the review.May I mention that the Royal Government ofBhutan  under the leadership of His Majesty the Kingand guided by the development philosophy of grossnational happiness  has been making concerted effortsto ensure the all-round development of the country andto realize the agreed goals of the various internationalconferences  in particular the Millennium Summit. Iam pleased to report that  with the continued support ofour development partners  Bhutan is hopeful ofachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.In that regard  I take this opportunity to express thedeep appreciation of the Royal Government and peopleof Bhutan to the United Nations and other donors fortheir contributions to the development of my country.As I conclude my statement  I would like to paytribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  forhis strong leadership and relentless efforts to advancethe cause of peace  development and security. We willcontinue to benefit from his vision and leadership forthe next two years. As he leaves his post at the end of2006  our work to find a suitable replacement to leadthe United Nations has to begin soon and in earnest.10My delegation believes that  in keeping with theprinciple of equitable geographical representation  andin consideration of Asia’s being the most populouscontinent with the largest regional grouping of 55members in the United Nations  a Secretary-Generalfrom Asia would be both timely and appropriate."
"28",1128,"BWA",59,2004,"Let me start by congratulatingyou  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election isa tribute not only to yourself  but also to your country Gabon  with which Botswana enjoys the most cordialof relations. 1 assure you of the full support andcooperation of my delegation in the discharge of youronerous duties and responsibilities.We also pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia  for his stewardship ofthe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. SaintLucia is another country with which Botswana enjoysexcellent relations. Come to think of it  we canunderstand why countries of the world can be friendlywith each other  as Botswana is friendly to them all.Our words of congratulations are addressed alsoto the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisvisionary leadership of the Organization and for hisenduring spirit in the face of the complex challengesthat the United Nations is called upon to address acrossour common universe.I take this opportunity to join other delegations inextending our condolences to the Government and thepeople of the Russian Federation on the tragic loss oflife in Beslan. There can never be any justification forsuch a savage attack on innocent children  men andwomen. Botswana joins the rest of the internationalcommunity in condemning that horrendous act.We also extend our sympathies and condolencesto our dear brothers and sisters in the Caribbean andthe southern part of the United States of America onthe loss of life and the destruction of property causedby recent hurricanes.We are gathered here today  12 months before thefirst review of the Millennium Declaration  anunprecedented compact made by world leaders to unitein action in addressing the problems bedevillinghumanity. It is our hope that we will use this gatheringto reflect on whether we have done enough to achievethe Millennium Development Goals. We have to askourselves  individually and collectively  whether theenthusiasm and political commitment with which weendorsed the Declaration is being translated intoprogrammes and projects. Simply put  we must beready to answer  hopefully in the affirmative  whetherwe are doing enough to meet the targets that we set forourselves for the first five years of this millennium.Let us recall that pessimists proclaimed theMillennium Summit a talking shop and poured scornon its intended outcome. Are we doing enough to provethem wrong? We owe it to the millions of our peoplewho look up to us to mitigate their suffering. Thus far the available evidence suggests that our performancehas been disappointing. Unfortunately  time is not onour side. There is need to act with vigour if we are tomeet our commitments.My delegation is fully aware that a multiplicity offactors combined to constrain and to thwart some ofour efforts in the past few years. There is no doubt  forinstance  that major international conflicts  such as thewar in Iraq  have been a drag on the internationalcommunity’s efforts to focus on the Goals. As a resultof the war  oil prices have skyrocketed  puttingtremendous pressure on the world economy  and inparticular on the vulnerable economies of developingcountries.In spite of those challenges  we have abidingfaith in the human spirit  and therefore remainconvinced that it is not beyond the capacity of theinternational community to implement those ideals.The Millennium Declaration recognized thatpoverty eradication is fundamental to achievingsustainable development  but many of our people stilllive in conditions of abject poverty. The alleviation ofpoverty and its eventual eradication therefore remain atop priority for us. Official development assistancelevels continue to fall in real terms to below the agreedtarget of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. I must however  commend the few countries that have metthat target. They have demonstrated that the target isrealistic and achievable.The continuing debt burden is contributingsignificantly to the failure to deal effectively with theproblem of poverty. Most developing countries haveundertaken courageous measures to implement painfulstructural reforms. The commendable steps taken tointroduce sound macroeconomic management andprinciples of good governance deserve an urgent positive and appropriate response. It must beacknowledged that some of the reforms can  in the shortterm  worsen the plight of the poor for a very long timebefore the benefits of the sacrifices are realized.8Structural reforms have not been confined tobudgetary matters alone. They cover the wholeeconomic spectrum  including the creation of anenvironment conducive to the growth of the privatesector and development  as well as to the flow offoreign direct investment. A number of developingcountries have promulgated legislative and regulatoryframeworks to stimulate greater private sectorparticipation in their economies. It is only natural given the scope of the reform measures  thatdeveloping countries should expect some positivereaction in the form of flows of foreign directinvestments  which at the moment are  regrettably  stillvery low.In the area of trade  we are concerned about theslow progress in multilateral trade negotiations. Asdeveloping countries  we have more to gain from amore just  fairer and rule-based international tradingsystem that would facilitate the integration of oureconomies into the global economy. We urge the majorplayers in those negotiations to show a greater sense ofurgency and commitment.We are concerned at the fact that  in spite of thestrong commitments expressed at the MillenniumSummit  almost half of the people in sub-SaharanAfrica continue to survive on a dollar a day. Thatreflects no change in the statistics of 1990. Onehundred twenty-one million children are still out ofschool; and the under-5 mortality rate is still as high as174 per 1 000 live births.The resources provided to fight the HIV/AIDSepidemic remain inadequate  yet we all agree thatHIV/AIDS is one of the greatest challenges of ourtime. Combating the scourge of HIV/AIDS musttherefore remain a high priority for action  because theepidemic has a debilitating impact on everything thatwe do to improve the human condition. In 2003  it wasreported that about 40 million people around the worldwere living with the virus  and that well over 26million of them were in sub-Saharan Africa alone. Theepidemic has killed over 2.3 million people in sub-Saharan Africa  out of a total of 3 million people whodied of AIDS-related illnesses around the world.In Botswana  our various intervention programmesare beginning to bear fruit. We are indebted to ourfriends internationally  whose partnership  support assistance and  indeed  solidarity have combined tosave lives and give hope to many of our people.However  a lot still needs to be done. Our immediatechallenge is the lack of capacity to provide theantiretroviral therapy programme to all who needassistance. We shall therefore continue to rely on theinternational community for consistent and assuredsupport  if we are to assist our people in time.International peace and security are underconstant threat. Our collective memory appears to befailing to draw appropriate lessons  even from therecent horrors of conflicts in Rwanda  Afghanistan andthe Balkans. Millions of people continue to suffer anddie needlessly in Africa and elsewhere because ofunnecessary conflicts. It is once again Africa that hashad to bear the brunt of those conflicts.We are concerned by the protracted conflicts inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  Sudan  Burundiand Côte d’Ivoire. As Africans  we accept ourresponsibility to find solutions to those conflicts. Thatis why we established the Peace and Security Councilof the African Union in May of this year. In its shorthistory  the Council has already deployed peacekeepersin Burundi and peace monitors in the Darfur region ofSudan  and has sent mediators and peace envoys tohelp in negotiating solutions to conflicts elsewhere onthe continent.One thing is clear: Africa is an integral part of theinternational community. The problems of Africa areglobal problems. We cannot isolate ourselves  nor beisolated from the rest of the world  and be expected tosingle-handedly find solutions to such conflicts. Weneed consistent and continued international support. Inthat regard  we acknowledge the important andcommendable role that the United Nations is playing inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  Côte d’Ivoireand Burundi.The peace process in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo is at a critical stage. The internationalcommunity has a duty and a responsibility to assist theGovernment and people of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo in the search for national reconciliation anda lasting political settlement to the problems facingthat country. It is our hope that the internationalcommunity will provide the necessary financial andmaterial support to ensure the success of theinternational conference on the Great Lakes region which is to be held in Arusha  United Republic ofTanzania  at the end of this year.9In Côte d’Ivoire  everything possible must bedone to maintain peace and stability  as well as topromote national reconciliation  by ensuring that theparties accept the Government of NationalReconciliation.Regarding the situation in the Darfur region ofSudan  the international community must take urgentmeasures to arrest the deteriorating security andhumanitarian situation in that country. The people ofDarfur should be assisted to return to their homes insafety and dignity. We urge the Government of Sudanto be receptive to the proposals contained in theSecretary-General’s report and  above all  take duecognizance of Security Council resolution 1564 (2004) and in particular to facilitate the speedy delivery by theinternational community of much-needed humanitarianassistance.We are troubled by the escalating conflict in theMiddle East  which is a serious threat to internationalpeace and security. How long can humanity stand thesight of human suffering that we see daily on ourtelevision screens? For how long can generations ofmothers mourn the loss of their sons in combat? Forhow long should succeeding generations fight wars thattheir forebears fought? We ask those involved in thoseconflicts  descendants of old civilizations that madeenormous contributions to the growth and developmentof modern civilization  to live and let live and to findin themselves the courage to resolve their differencesthrough dialogue rather than through indiscriminateviolence.Terrorism is one of the greatest challenges tointernational peace and security. No one country candefeat that scourge  which has caused the loss of manylives across the world. The activities of terrorists havebecome very complex and sophisticated. We needunited  stronger and concerted action by all thecountries of the world to defeat that scourge  whichknows no boundaries.In conclusion  I reaffirm the importance thatBotswana attaches to the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly and the reform of the Security Council. Wecommend the President of the fifty-eighth session ofthe General Assembly for his practical proposals inthat area. We were disappointed that the Assemblycould not reach consensus on those proposals. Mydelegation will contribute in whatever small way it canto the building of such consensus.Regarding the reform of the Security Council  weare concerned that  after 11 years of consultations  notmuch progress has been achieved. The solution to thatvexing question rests on the ability of Member States in particular the permanent members of the Council  tomuster the political will to compromise. We should nottolerate this paralysis any longer. It is therefore myhope that action will be taken at this session tocontinue the process of democratizing the SecurityCouncil and make it more representative of themembership of the United Nations.Finally  I once again make a special appeal to thegeneral Membership of the Organization to do more tofacilitate the implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration. We must do all we can to transform hopeinto reality. Together we have the resources  the skillsand the science and technology to make theDeclaration have meaning in the lives of our peoples.Botswana is committed to doing its part."
"29",1170,"CAF",59,2004,"Allow me at the outset to extend my warmcongratulations upon your election to the presidency ofthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Thatelection is a resounding tribute by the internationalcommunity to Gabon  that brother country  for itssingular leadership role in Africa  and for the personalcommitment of President Omar Bongo Ondimba thathas enabled Central Africans to be reconciled today for which we are most grateful. Your great experienceand ability as a diplomat and a statesman assure us ofthe success of our work.His Excellency François Bozizé  President of theRepublic and Head of State of my country  whose faithin the ideals of this Organization are unwavering wishes you all success. As you might expect  mydelegation will be fully with you in your endeavours. Iwould like to recall the competence with which your18predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia conducted the work of the fifty-eighth session.Allow me to extend to Secretary-General KofiAnnan the appreciation of the Central African Republicfor his endeavours to strengthen peace wherever it isthreatened and his resolve to find ways and means topreserve the authority and credibility of the UnitedNations  which has been so sorely tried in recent years.Before making its contribution and offering itsthoughts on the state of the world  my delegationwould like to join with all those who have expressedtheir sympathy to the populations that have fallenvictim to natural disasters taking place in parts of thePacific and on the American continent  which have lefta woeful train of destruction in their path.The major issues of the world today —international peace and security  combating poverty development  the defence and promotion of humanrights  protection of the environment and health —cannot find a lasting solution save through the commonefforts of the international community through UnitedNations. To echo the expressive words of theSecretary-General in his 2002 report entitledStrengthening of the United Nations: an agenda forfurther change  “The challenge ahead is to strengthenour capacity for collective action and thus forge acommon destiny in a time of accelerating globalchange (A/57/387  para. 2)”.In that context  multilateralism  which is the mainguarantee of the participation of all nations ininternational affairs  must be safeguarded andstrengthened at all costs. The spread of crisisflashpoints  the radicalization of international terrorismand organized crime  growing poverty and the spreadof endemic diseases — all of those things shouldconvince us that only active international solidarity iscapable of ensuring stability and security for ourworld.The tenacity with which terrorism is defying theinternational community in so many different ways isindeed disturbing. That scourge knows no borders race  or religion. The attacks of 11 September 2001 inNew York and Washington  11 March 2004 in Spainand 2 September 2004 in Russia are only its latestexpressions. Given the complexity of thatphenomenon  we must arrive at a collective response towhat has become a common menace. However because our countries lack adequate means to combatthat scourge  the essential problem of cooperation bythe richer countries arises in order to obtain betterequipment for detection  identification  surveillanceand control on our land  sea and air borders. Similarlythe fight against transnational organized crime alsocalls for large-scale cooperation under the aegis of thespecial fund for cooperation provided for by UnitedNations conventions.The difficult present international economiccontext has negatively affected the developingeconomies in general and African economies inparticular. Stiff international trade competition intensified protectionist practices  fluctuatingcurrencies  the burden of debt — all these arehandicaps that are slowing the development of ourcountries.In Cancun last year  members of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) tried to relaunch efforts towardsthe liberalization of trade. We must continue to seeksolutions to overcome the failure of Cancun and ensurethe success of the Doha round of trade negotiations.The 2004 WTO meeting in Geneva is proof that wemust not stand idly by when faced with the policy ofagricultural subsidies. The Millennium Declaration  theoutcome of the Johannesburg Summit and theMonterrey Consensus have laid out the path to befollowed and the goals to be pursued in order toestablish a true world partnership for development.Since the last General Assembly session  theworld has undergone a series of changes exacerbatingan already deteriorated situation as a result of threats topeace and security and a growing number of points ofconflict and tension. An example is the situation in theMiddle East  which is a source of deep concern.Indeed  despite the transfer of powers to the new Iraqiauthorities on 29 June  the spiral of violence continuesuncontrollably  fuelling the Iraqi people’s resentmentof the international community. The recentappointment of a Special Representative of theSecretary-General in Iraq means that the UnitedNations has a central role to play in the politicalreconstruction process there. However  the CentralAfrican Republic ardently hopes for theimplementation of proposals already made by France in cooperation with the Russian Federation  for aninternational conference on Iraq  within the frameworkof the United Nations.19In Israel  the international community mustcontinue to support the action of the Quartet to restorepeace between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.There is no alternative to the road map  which calls forparallel advances in the three areas of security  politicsand economics. In Africa  despite certain successessuch as the return to peace in Angola  Sierra Leoneand — little by little — in Liberia  the Africancontinent is still a source of deep concern. The surge inarmed conflicts  the tensions and the instabilities arebecoming a recurrent phenomenon. While the thirdAccra meeting favourably restarted the peace processin Côte d’Ivoire and gave rise to new hope  othersources of conflict are surfacing here and there.The Darfur crisis in the Sudan continues tomobilize the international community’s attention due tothe large movements of populations towards theborders with Chad and the insecurity that persiststhere. My Government is following with particularinterest the developments in the situation in Darfur dueto the humanitarian and security implications for theCentral African Republic  which borders on the Sudanand Chad.In the Central African Republic  we support theinitiatives taken  since the Chadian mediation  throughinternational forums  which have taken over from it inthe framework of the African Union and the UnitedNations. We encourage the Sudanese Government —which has proved its readiness — and the partiesinvolved to follow the path of wisdom based on thedialogue established by President Olusegun Obasanjo President of the African Union  and thus spare thebrotherly Sudanese people more suffering  sinceSecurity Council sanctions would only worsen theirsuffering.The massacre of 160 refugees in Gatumba on14 August 2004 on the border between the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and Burundi sparkedwidespread indignation and exacerbated an alreadydelicate situation in that part of the Great Lakes region.However  our conviction is that despite the setbacks the various agreements between Rwanda and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo on the one hand and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ugandaon the other  as well as the historic agreements of SunCity  have finally made progress towards peaceirreversible in the Great Lakes region.That  in any case  is the purpose of our activeparticipation in the preparatory process for theinternational conference on peace  security anddevelopment of the Great Lakes region and ourcontribution to the stability pact that will emerge fromit. This is within the framework of the global integrated and concerted approach sought by theUnited Nations  which has the advantage of pursuingregional solutions that will reach beyond thegeographical borders of the six countries of the GreatLakes region.I would like to touch on the situation in my owncountry  the Central African Republic. Proclaimedindependent on 13 August 1960  my country has gonethrough relatively brief periods of political and socialprogress  linked by long periods of economicstagnation and even retreat  justifying the opinions ofAfro-pessimists about its chaotic development. As withmany other African States  a series of coups markedour political development. Some of these were palacecoups and others involved a true popular revolutioncharacterized by both the crystallization of socialaspirations they unleashed and the political changesthey brought about  such as the Carnation Revolutionof Portugal in 1974. The changes of 15 March 2003were of that type. They were popular movementscarried forward by social forces that were as differentfrom each other as were the involved political parties labour unions  religious bodies  non-governmentalorganizations and the army.I am pleased once again to pay tribute to theresolute action of our Organization and that of thewhole international community  which spared no effortbefore 15 March 2003 to find a happy solution to theCentral African crisis  mobilizing the Security Council;the French-speaking world; the central organ of theformer Organization of African Unity (OAU) for theprevention  management and settlement of conflicts;the heads of State of the Central African Economic andMonetary Community  especially President El HadjOmar Bongo Ondimba; the Economic Community ofCentral African States; and the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States.For more than a year  the Central African peoplehave been trying to rebuild their broken unity  whilethe Government pursues the restoration of securitythroughout its territory. Confidence is growing withboth our bilateral and multilateral foreign partners.Constitutional legality will be established at the end of20free and transparent elections to take place in early2005. These are the main points of the timetable thatthe consensual transitional administration set up inJune 2003 and that it has been pursuing ever since  inkeeping with its commitments.Indeed  the national transitional council  aprovisional parliament established in July 2003  isrepresentative of all of the socio-political forces of thenation and fulfils a legislative function  including theadoption of legislation and the oversight ofgovernmental activities.The timetable for the transition also provided forthe organization of a national dialogue. For nearly twomonths  from September to October 2003  all of theactive forces of the nation came together in this forumto search together for the deep causes of what hasdivided us for so long. From these meetings emergedrecommendations  the main points of which underliethe activities of our Government today and thefundamental law of our country  on which our peopleare preparing to vote through a referendum. An organthat was specifically created to oversee the applicationof these recommendations  the national dialoguefollow-up committee  is now pursuing its mission.An independent joint electoral commission  madeup of representatives of political parties  civil societyand the administration  was also set up  which has justpublished the timetable for a future referendum andelections as follows: 30 November 2004  constitutionalreferendum; 30 January 2005  legislative andpresidential elections  first round; 27 February 2005 second round; 14 March 2005  announcement ofresults.The mission of the present transitionalGovernment is to bring about conditions permitting areturn to normal democratic life in the Central AfricanRepublic. However  the grave financial difficultiesfaced by my country do not enable it to face alone thecosts of these various elections. Of the 5.5 billion CFAfrancs necessary to finance these elections  we thus farhave only 3.5 billion. I would address an appeal forassistance to enable us to organize the elections underproper conditions and thus bring about a rapid return toconstitutional order.As of now  my Government sincerely thanks thebrother countries and international organizations thathave so generously contributed to financing thisprocess  especially France  the People’s Republic ofChina  the European Union and the Central AfricanEconomic and Monetary Community. The support thatthe international community will provide to this verydifficult and delicate phase in the history of the CentralAfrican Republic will be necessary to conclude thisconsensual transition. Our common dedication todemocracy prompts me to believe that this appeal bythe people and Government of my country will beheeded.The challenges to be overcome in fulfilling thegreat hopes inspired by the changes of 15 March 2003are many and pressing. These same challengesprompted the establishment of an agenda — a roadmap — that is focused on three major points: first consensual governance for a rapid return toconstitutional order; secondly  restoration of securityand an effective return to peace; and  thirdly combating poverty. The measures adopted by the newauthorities  as they are outlined above  will lead to therestoration of peace and national reconciliation andwere endorsed by the Central African people andrightly welcomed by the international community.Today  thanks to the re-establishment andrestructuring of our security and defence forces  thepresence of the multinational force from the CentralAfrican Economic and Monetary Community  withFrance providing logistical support  and assistancefrom friendly countries  in particular France  Libya  theSudan  the People’s Republic of China and Morocco as well as the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States  wecan say that the process of making the whole CentralAfrican territory secure has made significant progress.Efforts are still needed to ensure full security beforethe elections take place. But the relief felt by thepopulation and the hopes inspired by the changes ofMarch 2003 will be gravely compromised if thecommitments undertaken in this regard by theinternational community since May 2000 are notrealized.It is also essential that we attack the economicand financial problems as part of the struggle againstpoverty. From that perspective  the Central AfricanRepublic offers its full support to the Declaration onAction against Hunger and Poverty  adopted in NewYork on 20 September 2004 as a result of a jointinitiative by President Chirac and President IgnacioLula da Silva.21The post-conflict programme that myGovernment  working with the international financialinstitutions  has just drawn up provides a sound basisfor the reforms that are necessary if my country is tohave greater opportunities for success in the field ofreconstruction.The considerable efforts made at the nationallevel and the steadfast support of the friends of theCentral African Republic  including France  thePeople’s Republic of China and the countries membersof the Central African Economic and MonetaryCommunity  have helped to lift the burden that salaryarrears imposed on the transition process  with theresult that the people of the Central African Republicwill emerge stronger and more united.I could not conclude without touching upon asubject with regard to which all those who have spokenhave been unanimous: if we are to make progress inthis era  the United Nations must undertake a rationalreform — a reform that is necessary if the Organizationis to strengthen its role and enhance its effectiveness.That reform effort must begin by reconfiguringthe Security Council — the central organ entrustedwith the major task of dealing with issues of peace andsecurity. From the perspective of the delegation of theCentral African Republic  the initiative of France andGermany calling for a permanent seat for Germany and the similar appeal in favour of such seats forJapan  Africa and Latin America  should be givenserious consideration.Furthermore  the proposal of the Chairman-in-Office of the Economic Community of Central AfricanStates  President Denis Nguesso  calling for a politicalpresence in the United Nations in the person of arepresentative of the Secretary-General for CentralAfrica  is also worth consideration.The Central African Republic will supportproposals for reform submitted by the Secretary-General insofar as they strengthen the role of theOrganization in the maintenance of international peaceand security and the resolution of international issueson the basis of the principles of dialogue andmultilateral cooperation."
"30",1217,"CAN",59,2004,"I want to talk today aboutUnited Nations reform  particularly about the way weshould serve and the way we should do business if theUnited Nations is to play the role we want it to in thetwenty-first century.The world is organized into independent Statesand the primary obligation of Governments is to lookafter their own people. This presents us with afundamental dilemma  for unless we also actcollectively on the basis of our common humanity  therich will become richer  the poor will become poorer and hundreds of millions of people will be at risk.Thus  we need institutions whose primary obligation isto our common humanity. Herein lies the importance ofthe United Nations. It comprises Member States  but itsmission is  indeed  to serve the world's peoples. ItsCharter makes this very clear:'We the peoples of the United Nations [are]determined - to reaffirm faith in fundamentalhuman rights  in the dignity and worth of thehuman person  in the equal rights of men andwomen.'Others  quite properly  will talk about structuralreform. But today I want to talk about reformsdesigned to put our common humanity at the centre ofthe agenda of the United Nations.Canada sees five areas where bold steps arerequired. The first area is the responsibility toprotect - the need to develop the rules and thepolitical will that would allow the internationalcommunity to intervene in countries to prevent ahumanitarian catastrophe.Darfur is a human tragedy of immenseproportions.(spoke in French)We welcome the Security Council's support forexpanded engagement there  although we believe theinternational response should be more robust. TheAfrican Union  which has agreed to lead that effort must have the unswerving support of the internationalcommunity. Canada is offering $20 million to assist and we call on others to join in now.(spoke in English)It is good that the international community isfinally moving  but it has taken far too long. TheSecurity Council has been bogged down in debatingthe issue. It has looked at whether Darfur is a threat tointernational peace and security. It is consideringwhether the tragedy qualifies as genocide  becauseeither could provide justification  under internationallaw  for intervention. The fact is  though  that  whilethe international community struggles with definitions the people of Darfur struggle with disaster. They arehungry  they are homeless  they are sick  and manyhave been driven out of their own country. Tens ofthousands have been murdered  raped and assaulted.War crimes and crimes against humanity are beingcommitted.We must not let debates about definitions becomeobstacles to action. We should not have to go throughsuch painful exercises to figure out how to respond tohumanitarian catastrophe. We need clear principles that31will allow the international community to intervenemuch faster in situations like the one in Darfur.Our common humanity should be a powerfulenough argument  and yet that is precisely what ismissing. Put simply  there is still no explicit provisionin international law for intervention on humanitariangrounds. The 'responsibility to protect' is intended tofill that gap. It says that we should have the legal rightto intervene in a country on the grounds ofhumanitarian emergency alone. We should be able todo so when the Government of a country is unwillingor unable to protect its people from extreme harm as aresult of internal war  repression or  simply  Statefailure.The primary responsibility for the protection of aState's own population lies with that State itself. Weare not arguing for a unilateral right to intervene in onecountry whenever another country feels like it. It isalways preferable to have multilateral authority forintervention in the affairs of a sovereign State. Whatwe seek is the evolution of international law andpractice so that multilateral action may be taken insituations of extreme humanitarian emergency.International law is moving in the right direction.Existing instruments such as the Convention onGenocide and human rights treaties acknowledgeStatesí obligations to their own people. Theestablishment of the International Criminal Court andcriminal tribunals are further steps forward. Thuscustomary international law is evolving to provide asolid basis in the building of a normative frameworkfor collective humanitarian intervention. To speed italong  however  Member States should now adopt aGeneral Assembly resolution recognizing the evolutionof sovereignty to encompass the internationalresponsibility to people. In turn  the Security Councilshould establish new thresholds for when theinternational community judges that civilianpopulations face extreme threats; and for exploringnon-military and  if necessary  proportionate militaryoptions to protect civilians. The responsibility toprotect is not a license for intervention; it is aninternational guarantor of political accountability.The second area I would speak to is the'responsibility to deny'  which encompasses the needto ensure that weapons of mass destruction do notunder any circumstances spread to States or terroristsprepared to use them  especially against innocentcivilians. Non-proliferation and disarmament remainfundamental pillars of the commitment of the UnitedNations to international peace and security.In both cases  multilateralism has beenchallenged by dramatic changes in the security climate and there is a clear need to make our systems strongerand more responsive. Strict verification is the key.The United Nations nuclear watchdog  theInternational Atomic Energy Agency  needs strongertools  and it needs political support. We need morerigorous controls on sensitive nuclear technology  andthe Security Council must be prepared to deal withnon-compliance effectively. The fact is that  as we allknow  determined proliferators have been able tocircumvent their treaty obligations. The United Nationsshould establish a permanent inspection andverification mechanism that can reinforce andsupplement existing verification systems.More generally  and to show how far we have togo on the disarmament agenda  and on theresponsibility to deny  the Conference onDisarmament  charged with the responsibility fornegotiating new multilateral instruments  has not evenbeen able to agree on a work plan since 1998. Surelythe Conference must get back to productive work.(spoke in French)The third area is the 'responsibility to respect'human beings  their dignity  their freedom and theirculture. I would like to talk about a broader notion ofhuman rights - one that can encompass individualrights  the protection of collective rights and pluralism as reflected in the concept of cultural diversity. In fact the United Nations Development Programmeís recentHuman Development Report stresses that culturaldiversity is also tied in with freedom. That is why wesupport a United Nations Educational  Scientific andCultural Organization instrument on culturalpromotion.Since the United Nations Charter and theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  humanity hasmade remarkable strides in the area of human rights.Conventions are now in place to protect a number ofrights: civil  political  economic  social and cultural.But we must remain vigilant in the face of new formsof abuse  such as international trafficking of people andthe horrifying child sex trade.32In addition to the protections afforded individualrights  various conventions have also been concludedto better protect minorities  to denounce racialdiscrimination and to combat marginalization.Nevertheless  it is apparent that the most divisiveconflicts result  more often than not  from attempts byone group to prevent other groups from realizing theirperfectly legitimate economic  religious  social orpolitical aspirations. Entire communities arethreatened. Violence  civil strife and even failed Statesensue. Kosovo  Bosnia  the Great Lakes region inAfrica  and today Darfur are the most chillingexamples. The international community must takevigorous action to protect individuals as well asminority communities. It is not enough to simplypossess various legal instruments; they must be putinto practice. Institutions responsible for human rightsmust reveal to the entire world those guilty of abuse -be they armed groups  communities or Governments -and take the necessary measures. The United Nations isour moral conscience and it is up to us to act.The fourth area is the responsibility to build. Theobjectives of the Millennium Summit on poverty disease and global insecurity will come to naught if wedo not follow up on the Monterrey Consensus according to which genuine development requires aholistic approach to such issues as debt  market accessand social investment.That being said  as we have seen in Haiti over thepast 10 years  all the aid in the world will have only afleeting effect if a country does not have functioningpublic institutions. We must build countries'governance capacities and take the time to do it right.The same is true for economic institutions. Those thatwork well marshal the creative energies of localentrepreneurs. That is the message of the UnitedNations Commission on the Private Sector andDevelopment: a thriving economy is the product ofcitizens' trust in their countryís public institutions. Inbrief  development depends on governance.Lastly  there is responsibility for the future which is to say the obligation we have to leave a betterworld for our children. That is no small challenge. Itinvolves all aspects of our common heritage: health the environment  oceans  space. The new pandemicsdemand our most urgent attention. AIDS  SARS andthe Ebola virus are sounding a terrifying alarm  butscientists are predicting even worse diseases. TheWorld Health Organization must bolster itssurveillance systems. It must do a better jobcoordinating its actions with those of other UnitedNations bodies.Beyond health issues lies the whole question ofmanaging our environment. It is gravely threatened.Only international cooperation and technical assistancecan bring lasting solutions to such problems as accessto clean air and water. Furthermore  we need an oceanspolicy that allows us to rebuild our fish stocks. Accessto fisheries must be better regulated under internationallaw. Simply put  the pillage of those global resourcesmust stop.Space is our final frontier. It has always capturedour imagination. What a tragedy it would be if spacebecame one big weapons arsenal and the scene of anew arms race. In 1967  the United Nations agreed thatweapons of mass destruction must not be based inspace. The time has come to extend that ban to allweapons.(spoke in English)I have talked today about responsibilities. Inconclusion  let me mention one more: theresponsibility to act. We await the report of theSecretary-Generalís High-Level Panel and weanticipate substantial recommendations for reform.Many countries are focused on the Security Counciland we should support reforms that will make it moreeffective and will permit those countries which activelysupport United Nations peacekeeping  developmentand other activities to continue to have a meaningfulopportunity to serve.But we must also look forward torecommendations that go well beyond the SecurityCouncil. For example  there is a need to set outmeasures to facilitate an integrated response to thediverse range of security challenges that each of usfaces  from the proliferation of terrorism to improvingUnited Nations coordination on development  healthand the environment. As individual countries  asindividual members of regional organizations  and asparticipants in various international groups that formaround specific interests  we all must act to bridge thedifferences that divide us and to forge an internationalconsensus for reform of the United Nations.In another context  for instance  Canada hasproposed a special meeting at which leaders from 20 orso countries in the developed and developing worlds33would get together to discuss our collective challengesand responsibilities. This could very well includeproviding a major boost to United Nations reformefforts.In any event  no matter how one comes at it  thetime has come for real reform of the United Nations.All of us in this Hall and in our respectiveGovernments must put aside narrow interests and workto common purpose to strengthen this universalinstitution  whose activities give force to our commonhumanity.Four years ago  at the Millennium Summit  theleaders of the world agreed that 'we have a duty - toall the world's people  especially the most vulnerable'(resolution 55/2  para. 2). That duty will not bedischarged unless we as Governments speak to thedignity and to the freedom of every human being onEarth  here at the world's meeting place of nations."
"31",1232,"CHE",59,2004,"Two yearsago I had the great satisfaction of personallywitnessing  in this very Hall  Switzerland’s entry intothe United Nations. I will never forget the whole-hearted welcome that Switzerland received on thatoccasion.Switzerland’s accession to the United Nationstook place at a time when the fight against terrorismdominated international debate and divergences inopinion on how to proceed with respect to Iraq werewidening. Dissension arose once again within theSecurity Council. That experience showed that anyaction taken in the absence of a mandate that is clearlydefined in a Security Council resolution is doomed tofailure. Such actions can only result in differences ofopinion that reduce the effectiveness of theinternational community’s efforts and jeopardizeinternational security.When all is said and done  however  the Iraqcrisis has made clear that the international communityremains committed to a multilateral system formaintaining international peace and security  but thatthe structures currently in place are no longerappropriate.There is now  therefore  a clear need for reformand for strengthening the means of joint action. TheHigh-Level Panel appointed by the Secretary-Generalto make recommendations for ensuring effective jointaction is a first step on the road to reform. Switzerlandactively supports that initiative.Thus  this past spring  we invited a group ofexperts to discuss the subject of the right of self-defence  and in that context  the role of the SecurityCouncil. Their conclusion was that it is neithernecessary nor desirable to extend or reinterpret theright of individual self-defence set out in the Charter.What we must do is strengthen joint action; that is theissue on which we must focus.In this context  prevention is essential. On the onehand  we must ensure improved living conditionsthroughout the world; on the other  multilateralinstitutions must respond more rapidly to nascentcrises.17A more rapid response does not necessarily meanmilitary intervention. Switzerland has always held theview that force must remain an instrument of lastresort. Apart from situations of self-defence  force maybe used only with the approval of the Security Counciland when other methods of persuasion or pressure havebeen exhausted.A more rapid response also means that theSecurity Council must fully exercise its primaryresponsibility for maintaining international peace andsecurity  which is conferred upon it by the Charter.This raises the issue of the legitimacy of action of theSecurity Council and  in particular  the question of itscomposition. After more than 10 years of deliberationon that issue  it is time we found a solution. Thecomposition of the Security Council must better reflectthe changes that have taken place in the internationalcontext since its creation  and developing countriesmust have a greater role to play. Greater account mustbe taken of the financial and material contributions ofspecific Member States.On the other hand  Switzerland is opposed to thecreation of new seats with the right of veto  becausethe right of veto in its current form is undemocratic andhampers the capacity of the Security Council to act. Inthe interests of greater legitimacy  those countries thatare not members of the Security Council should havemore opportunity to participate in the decision-makingprocess. In particular  it is important to strengthenmechanisms for consultation with countries directlyinvolved in situations of tension.Reforming institutions may be an arduous andunrewarding task  but it is indispensable for increasingthe efficiency of the United Nations and for promotingpeace. I would like to thank the Secretary-General forthe work that he has already done and encourage himto continue along the same path.Over and above institutional aspects  thecommitment of Member States is critical if the UnitedNations is to be effective. First of all  if it is to remaincredible  the United Nations and its Member Statesmust be the unassailable guarantors of internationallaw and  in particular  international humanitarian law. Iwould like to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for having emphasized today the absoluteprimacy of the rule of law — a source a strength forthe weak. Switzerland will continue to insist thatrespect for the rule of law is the only practical wayforward. In the absence of a political solution to theconflict in Darfur  for example  civilians have becomethe victims of attacks that constitute a serious violationof international humanitarian law — a violation whichmust be punished by the appropriate national and  ifnecessary  international  bodies.For that reason  too  following the adoption ofresolution ES-10/15 on the advisory opinion of theInternational Court of Justice — which found that theconstruction of the separation barrier in the occupiedPalestinian territory by Israel is contrary tointernational law — Switzerland accepts  in itscapacity as depositary of the Geneva Conventions  themandate to conduct consultations on ways and meansfor the parties concerned to achieve greater respect forinternational humanitarian law.If it is to be strong  the United Nations must beable to rely on those States with the necessaryresources to help it carry out its tasks. All of thosecountries  including my own  are called upon toprovide the personnel and materials needed bypeacekeeping missions. The appalling attack on theUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad underscoresthe need to give special consideration to the security ofthe United Nations and its staff. Fortunately  additionalsecurity measures are now in place. Other measuresmust follow. It is our shared duty to ensure that theSecretary-General has the necessary financial resourcesat his disposal.As I said earlier  prevention will depend on thefight against poverty. In autumn next year  we plan togather together to undertake the first assessment of thestate of progress on the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. We must already admit that our efforts havebeen inadequate. Of course  every country has itsbudgetary constraints. But we also have a duty to keepthe promises we made at the dawn of the millennium.President Lula da Silva made this point earlier forcefully and with commitment. He recalled ourresponsibility to history — which we endorse — toeliminate poverty while we have the means to do so.In that context  I welcome the fact that tradeliberalization within the framework of the Doha Roundregained some momentum this summer in Geneva.Difficult negotiations still lie ahead of us —negotiations that must seek to meet expectations thatare sometimes contradictory. Switzerland intends toplay a constructive role  and I call on all our partners to18commit themselves to ensure the early success of thedevelopment round.Prevention will require us to both detect anddefuse today the problems of tomorrow. I believe thatour efforts to promote peace must be rapidly fleshedout in two areas. The first of these is conflict that isborne of religion. Killing is unacceptable  and it isespecially so if it is carried out for religious reasons.Yet increasingly frequently  religion is becoming theonly frame of reference for analysing political andsocial problems. Such an extreme simplification ofreality runs the risk of heightening tension. Theinternational community must find a solution  and theUnited Nations is the ideal forum in which to do so.The second area is environmental preservation.The increasing scarcity of resources is sowing theseeds of conflict over appropriation and distribution.Sustainable development must not be allowed tobecome an empty concept. Our actions to date withinthe context of the United Nations have not beensufficient to enable us to fulfil our responsibilitiestowards future generations. Devoting more time toseeking agreement on the Kyoto Protocol than thefounding fathers took to draft the Charter of the UnitedNations is beneath our dignity.The United Nations will be judged by its successin meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century.The institutional reforms now under way are a step inthe right direction. It is up to us  the Member States resolutely to commit ourselves to promote peace and tomake the United Nations the instrument for carryingout that essential task."
"32",1278,"CHL",59,2004,"Iwish to express our satisfaction at seeing Mr. Pingpreside over this fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly and we wish him a successful presidency.24Ever since the signing of the Charter of SanFrancisco  and before that during the time of theLeague of Nations  Chile has been firmly committed tothe international community  to multilateralcooperation and to the best values of peace  security development and human rights which this Organizationrepresents. Chile has been an active participant in theinternational system because we believe thatgovernance at the global level is the logical extensionof the institutional order that each State has achievedand can demonstrate in this global forum.While in the last century our main task was toestablish rules of coexistence and conduct for theinternational community  today  faced with thechallenges of the twenty-first century  that task  in ouropinion  has become more urgent and ineluctable.What we have before us is a panorama of positiveopportunities  on the one hand  and of complex threats on the other.For countries such as ours  integration into theglobal community creates opportunities which a closedsociety would preclude. We see integration into theglobal community as providing possibilities for growthand for creating space for our efforts  and we feel thatthis is the inescapable destiny of all of us. Countriesneed freedom  peace  security and respect forinternational law; based on scrupulous respect fortreaties  we need to work towards the building of ashared global order.Stability can be achieved only throughgovernance under which all interests are represented.Thus  voices are being raised in various countries inorder to state the obvious: no one can shape the worldthat is emerging except through agreements andnegotiations. The complexity of the world emergingbefore our eyes is too great to be handled in acentralized or unipolar manner.Of course  little will be achieved if  at the sametime  each country does not put its own house in order.Without justice  solidarity and respect for humanrights  there can be no stable or genuinely beneficialgovernance in our own societies in the medium term. Itherefore believe that it is the responsibility of each ofour societies to apply the principles of the UnitedNations and to make them realities. We have an ethicalduty to be efficient and effective in the attainment ofthose goals and ideals.It is clear  however  that globalization alsoincludes negative aspects that can affect us all. Today we are afflicted by such public evils as terrorism andorganized crime; illicit trafficking in persons  arms anddrugs; and the money-laundering associated with thoseactivities.Nothing is more counter to our principles thanterrorism  a virtual dark force of globalization.Accordingly  here in the United Nations  Chile hascontributed through its efforts in chairing both theAl Qaeda/Taliban Security Council sanctionsCommittee and the Counter-Terrorism Committee  keyinstruments of the international community for wagingthis combat. Globalization also has negative spill-overeffects on the environment and exacerbates themarginalization of millions of people in societies oreven continents who are unable to achieve integrationinto the global economy and global society.Faced with that reality of light and shadow countries like Chile have a stake in helping to improvethe positive aspects of globalization and to eliminateits negative aspects. But how do we turn those aimsinto reality? In our view  the best way to guide theagenda of globalization is through multilateralism. It isin the strengthening of multilateralism that eachcountry has a stake and a national task to fulfil.As a non-permanent member of the SecurityCouncil  Chile has assumed its responsibility to theglobal community and has sought to act consistentlywith our values and convictions. Last year  with regardto Iraq  we said that only the United Nations could givethe necessary legitimacy for the use of force and foraddressing in an effective and unified manner thethreats to peace arising from that country. For thatreason  and in order to be consistent with ourcommitment to multilateralism  we said yes to theUnited Nations when the Security Council requestedthe presence of a multinational interim force in Haiti.We reacted in solidarity by dispatching to Haiti  in lessthan 72 hours  a military force and humanitarianassistance.We have shown that our region is capable ofassuming the responsibilities required to ensureinternational peace and security. Not since the periodof our national independence have forces fromdifferent Latin American countries acted collectivelyand independently of the great Powers in a mission tomaintain peace in one of our countries. Today in Haiti 25the troops of a number of Latin American countries supplemented by the joint Spanish/Moroccan force  areunder the command of a Brazilian general and therepresentative of the Secretary-General is a Chilean.If we wish to strengthen multilateralism  reformof the United Nations is becoming increasinglynecessary. Its ideals and founding purposes remainvalid  but  as a number of speakers have noted here  thepower structure upon which the Organization was builtat its inception corresponds to a world that is verydifferent from todayís world. Not only do we need toexpand the Security Council to make it moredemocratic; comprehensive reform of the Organizationis also needed. In addition  the United Nations needsspecialization  not a proliferation of similarinstitutions. It needs greater accountability and a moretransparent system of recruitment. It needs to derivethe maximum benefit from every last cent that itspends. Many of our States are making those or similarchanges in their own public systems. The UnitedNations can be better than we can in that area. It is achallenge for the Organization and for each of ourStates.I had the opportunity to exchange ideas withsome members of the High-Level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change. That is why I am convincedthat the Panel will offer to the Secretary-Generalrecommendations aimed at strengthening two keyareas: first  generate a political commitment thatreaffirms the values of the Charter of the UnitedNations; and  secondly  strengthen the system so that itcan face the challenges and opportunities of a worldthat is more global than it was 60 years ago.The world requires a larger and better UnitedNations. We have unacceptable humanitarian crises such as that in Darfur  Sudan; a steady deterioration inthe outlook for peace in the Middle East; and terroristattacks  such as those in Beslan  Russia  and in front ofthe Australian Embassy in Jakarta  Indonesia.In the Security Council  Chile supported thetransfer of national sovereignty to the people of Iraq and we hope to see the elections scheduled for nextJanuary. In the case of Afghanistan  United Nationselectoral assistance has been essential in thepreparations for the elections scheduled for thebeginning of October.The world to which we aspire will be better andreflect greater solidarity with the effective participationof citizens. In that spirit  we will host in Chile nextyear the Third Ministerial Conference of theCommunity of Democracies.Likewise  we are convinced that globalizationwill be better only if civil society is recognized as oneof its principal actors. That consideration has been adecisive factor in the Action against Hunger andPoverty  which we ó together with the leaders ofBrazil  France and Spain and the Secretary-General óhave promoted to effectively contribute to theattainment of the Millennium Goals.Yesterday's meeting presented us with a greatchallenge: have specific answers within 12 months before the next General Assembly session. Some of theactions proposed depend on governmental decisions;others are the responsibility of multilateralorganizations and civil society ó particularly non-governmental organizations  the business community trade unions and universities. We say clearly: it is timeto recognize that  in practical terms  the exclusivemonopoly of States or Governments in the internationalsphere has ended; everyone is called upon toparticipate.The question is whether reform is possible. Whywould the powerful give up some of their power? Ourmodest experience has shown us that one can negotiatefree trade  for example  with the worldís mostindustrialized countries and reach agreementsbeneficial to both sides. Today  trade agreements covertwo thirds of our exports  more than half of which arealready free from tariffs. That has not been a simplematter; it requires time  preparation and patience. Andwhy not say this? It involves a degree of conflict withthe more developed countries. Trade agreements  inand of themselves  do not provide solutions for a set ofissues that can be resolved only at the multilaterallevel.That is why we need to successfully conclude theDoha round  because there  decisive issues are at stakethat we have not been able to resolve through bilateralnegotiation. There we must resolve the issue of anti-dumping  the situation of subsidized agricultural andtextile products  complex issues such as those relatedto intellectual property  and the question of how to dealwith pandemics by using generic or low-cost drugs.Those issues are multilateral in nature. We musttherefore deal with them multilaterally  and in doing so26we must be strong - we  the countries that understandthat we are going to define more just trade rules.It is in that area that common sense is of muchmore help than dogmatism. One cannot ask others togive up their fundamental interests  but neither cananyone hope complacently for unfair results. That iswhy integration into the global society is a stairwaywith many steps. What is important is not to lose asense of progress ó progress towards trade that is free but fair; towards capital flows that are free  notpredatory; towards cultural expansion  not destructionof what is local: our roots  what we are  our identities;towards an exchange of ideas  not lockstep thinking óin short  towards pluralism  so that we all can be better.I have tried to share with the Assembly the visionand the responsibilities of a country of the South ó anopen country that is interdependent with the rest of theworld. Our modest experience has shown us that it isimperative to strengthen multilateralism as the onlyapproach with the legitimacy necessary to ensureinclusive globalization that reflects solidarity - as hasbeen said here  globalization with a human face.In conclusion  todayís world requires a larger  nota smaller  United Nations and more  not less multilateralism. Our experience tells us that we canmake a reality of our shared dream - the dream thatwas dreamt 60 years ago in San Francisco  but thatnow obliges us to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century that is beginning."
"33",1324,"CHN",59,2004,"Ioffer my warm congratulations to you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-ninth session. I am confident that under yourpresidency fruitful results will be achieved. I also wishto pay a cordial tribute to Mr. Julian Robert Hunte President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession  and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.The recent appalling terror in Beslan  Russia caused massive casualties  including many children.On behalf of the Chinese Government  I stronglycondemn  once again  that inhuman act of terroristviolence and extend our deep condolences to thefamilies of the victims.Peace and development remain the dominantthemes in today’s world. Multipolarization andeconomic globalization are moving forward in twistsand turns. Science and technology are advancing at adizzying speed. Forces that make for peace and factorsthat lead to war are both on the rise. Human society ismoving in a bright  progressive and positive direction.However  the light of peace has not fallen onevery corner of the globe  nor has development reachedevery inch of the Earth. Threats to security  bothtraditional and non-traditional  are intertwined. Thedark cloud of war remains menacing. Hot spots keepspringing up. Terrorist activities are raging  and cross-border problems such as the proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction  drug trafficking  transnationalcrime and illegal immigration are erupting one afteranother. Factors of uncertainty  instability andunpredictability are increasing.In the course of economic globalization  the gapbetween the North and the South is widening.Developing countries are confronting new difficultiesand challenges as a growing number of them arefurther marginalized. Today  half the global populationlives on less than $2 a day  and of those  1.2 billion liveon less than $1 a day. Much remains to be done toimplement the Millennium Development Goals.Peace  development and cooperation are theprerequisites for our times. People all over the worldare raising their voice in favour of peace  developmentand cooperation and against war  poverty andconfrontation. Peace is the precondition for humandevelopment and prosperity. Without a peaceful andstable international environment  development is out ofthe question for any country. A chaotic world benefitsno one. Having experienced the scourge of two worldwars  mankind would not tolerate any more war orbloodshed. Thus it is the fervent aspiration of allpeoples to live and achieve development in a secureand stable environment.In tackling security issues  it is imperative tofoster a new security concept of mutual trust  mutualbenefit  equality and cooperation. This new conceptcalls for nations to transcend their differences inideology and social systems  respect one another’ssecurity interests  promote greater democracy ininternational relations and seek peaceful solutions todisputes through dialogue.Terrorism is the common enemy of the wholeworld. China stands firmly opposed to terrorism in allforms and manifestations. To prevent and fightterrorism  we must intensify international cooperationand address both the causes and symptoms of thethreat. Only when the root causes of terrorism areeradicated can peoples live in peace and tranquillityagain.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionposes a threat to world peace and security. Non-proliferation efforts therefore require the participationof all members of the international community.Likewise  it is important to discard unilateralism anddouble standards and to give full credit and full latitudeto the role of the United Nations.China takes an active part in multilateral non-proliferation efforts and firmly defends theinternational regime of arms control  disarmament andnon-proliferation treaties. China believes thatmultilateral arms control  disarmament and non-proliferation processes can be steadily promoted inorder to further improve the international non-proliferation regime.There is still a long way to go before peace andreconstruction can be realized in Iraq. We support animportant role for the United Nations in Iraq’s politicalprocess  helping that country achieve the smoothholding of elections.10We appeal to Palestine and Israel to resumedialogue as soon as possible and to start implementingthe Middle East road map faithfully. As always  Chinawill work to resolve the nuclear issue on the KoreanPeninsula through dialogue and talks  in the interest ofpeace and stability on the Peninsula.Development is the foundation for humanprogress. Lasting peace and stability throughout theworld depends on coordinated  balanced and universaldevelopment. Development is of overridingimportance. Living in peace  abundance and harmonybetween nations has been the dream of manygenerations. Coordinated  balanced and sustainabledevelopment serves the fundamental interests of allpeoples and works for their well-being.In order to promote economic growth worldwide it is necessary for the international community to takeeffective measures to put in place an open and fairmultilateral trading regime and gradually improve it. Itis also important to reform and improve theinternational financial system.The developed countries must honour theircommitments to debt reduction  technology transferand market access through concrete actions in order toenable developing countries to really benefit fromglobalization. The developing countries  for their part need to work together to attain development and takepart in a wide range of international efforts. Theyshould also deepen South-South cooperation.We  the members of the international community should join hands in working for a just and equitablenew international economic order that meets the needsof the growing economic globalization and serves thecommon interests of all countries.The Millennium Development Goals are oursolemn  collective pledge. The United Nations shouldfurther mobilize resources  strengthen coordination andincrease its input to development activities in order tohelp Member States achieve these important goals asscheduled.Cooperation is an effective way of dealing withthe collective challenges facing humankind. Tostrengthen international cooperation  we mustchampion multilateralism. The United Nations is thecentre of the international multilateral system and thekey platform for making multilateralism work. It is thewidespread desire of the international community toadhere to the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter  take more collective actions strengthen the role of the United Nations and safeguardits authority.The threats and challenges we face make itimperative to strengthen  rather than weaken  the roleof the United Nations. A stronger United Nations isindispensable for maintaining global peace andstability and promoting the common development ofhumankind. All Member States should honour theircommitments to the Charter of the United Nations andfulfil their international responsibilities andobligations.The world is eagerly looking forward to adynamic and action-oriented United Nations. Chinasupports necessary and rational reforms of theOrganization. Such reforms should aim at enhancingthe leading role of the United Nations in internationalaffairs  reinforcing its capacity to tackle new threatsand challenges  and ensuring that better reflects theaspirations and needs of the vast majority ofdeveloping countries.China is in favour of expanding the SecurityCouncil and of giving priority to greater representationof the developing countries. China also supports thework of the High-level Panel on Threats  Challengesand Change  and it is looking forward to the Panel’sreport by the end of this year  so that it can be reviewedby Member States.China is a staunch force working for world peace common development and international cooperation.After over half a century of strenuous efforts and morethan two decades of reform and opening up  China hasnow entered a new stage of development aimed atbuilding a moderately prosperous society all-round.However  China is still a developing country  and alarge population and inadequate economicdevelopment remain its basic national conditions. Ithas a long way to go before achieving its developmentgoals.The Chinese Government will always placedevelopment at the top of its agenda. The fact thatChina — a large  developing country with 1.3 billionpeople — runs its own affairs well is in itself a majorcontribution to peace and to the development ofhumanity.11China desires peace  development andcooperation  and strives to win peace and developmentthrough cooperation. It is working to promotedemocracy in international relations  diversity in itsmodes of development and richness in the world’scivilizations. It advocates a new security concept andfacilitates the establishment of a fair and equitable newinternational order.China will pursue with determination anindependent foreign policy of peace  adhere to the fiveprinciples for Peaceful Coexistence  and engage inmutually beneficial and friendly cooperation with othercountries on an equal footing.China will unswervingly safeguard itssovereignty and territorial integrity  brook nointerference in its internal affairs by foreign forces and at the same time  respect other countries’ sovereigntyand territorial integrity.China remains committed to the commoninterests of humankind. China’s national interests  inthe final analysis  are consistent with the commoninterests of all humankind. In handling State-to-Staterelations  China will safeguard its own interests whiletaking into account the interests of other countries.China will adhere to the policy of opening up  anddevelop economic relations and trade with all othernations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.China’s development stands in the way of no one nor does it pose any threat to others. China is followingthe path of peaceful development  seeking aninternational environment of peace and stability for itsown development and promoting world peace andprogress through its own prosperity.China is working steadily to develop its relationswith the world’s major countries. It will staycommitted to the policy of building friendship andpartnership with its neighbours and combine strongerbilateral friendships with enhanced regionalcooperation. It will strengthen solidarity andcooperation with other developing countries andsupport any justified demands or legitimatepropositions on their part in international affairs. It willplay a constructive role in the political  economic social  disarmament  arms control and othermultilateral fields; safeguard the purposes andprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and theuniversally recognized norms governing internationalrelations; and support any consensus that serves thecommon interests of all countries.Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.Safeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorialintegrity and realizing complete national reunificationat an early date is the common will and firm resolve ofthe 1.3 billion Chinese people. Pursuing the policy of“peaceful reunification and one country  two systems” the Chinese Government is ready to work tirelesslytowards a peaceful reunification with the utmostsincerity. We  more than anyone else  want to see apeaceful settlement of the Taiwan question. But wewill never tolerate Taiwan independence  nor will weallow anyone to separate Taiwan from the rest of Chinain any way.We hope that the international community willfully recognize the complex and sensitive nature of thecurrent situation across the Taiwan Strait and theserious threat posed by the separatist activities of theTaiwan authorities to the stability of the Taiwan Straitand the peace of the Asia-Pacific region. We expect theAssembly to continue supporting the ChineseGovernment’s efforts for peaceful reunification and tojoin us in containing pro-independence activities  in theinterest of stability in the Strait and of world peace.This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of theFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As the basicguidelines for State-to-State relations  the FivePrinciples have withstood the test of half a century andremain an irrefutable truth. The Five Principles  whichinclude peace  development and cooperation  areconsistent with the purposes and principles of theCharter of the United Nations. They provide guidancefor the establishment and development of relationsbetween countries with identical or different socialsystems; point to the correct path towards the peacefulsettlement of outstanding issues between countries andinternational disputes; firmly defend the interests of thedeveloping countries; and facilitate the improvementand development of North-South relations. The FivePrinciples present important ideas that must underpinthe establishment of a fair and equitable newinternational order.China not only initiated  but has faithfullyobserved  the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.Given the new realities of today  we will continue tochampion those Principles and join all the peoples of12the world in advancing the lofty cause of peace development and cooperation."
"34",1358,"CIV",59,2004,"Allow me to convey to you  Sir  on behalf of the headof State  the Prime Minister and the Government andpeople of Côte d’Ivoire  my sincere congratulations onyour unanimous election to preside over the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session.Africa is proud to see  yet again  one of its sonsin that eminent role. The sign of confidence on the partof all States Members of the United Nations reflectsthe great appreciation of the role being played by yourcountry  Gabon  and by its President  His ExcellencyEl Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba  in dealing with themajor issues characterizing development in the world particularly in Africa.I am also gratified to have this opportunity to sayhow grateful we are to your predecessor  Mr. JulianHunte  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia who  with his many years of skill as a diplomat brilliantly discharged his mission. He also deserves ourgratitude and our plaudits.Finally  I would like to express my warmappreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan for the active and decisive role he has continued toplay as head of the United Nations.During the year 2004  the process of nationalpeace and reconciliation initiated  following thesigning of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement and ofAccra II  by the parties and political forces in Côted’Ivoire encountered a major deadlock with the eventsin March and the suspension of the activities of theGovernment of National Reconciliation.A solution to that dangerous deadlock requireddetermined action from all parties involved. Thataction  fortunately  was forthcoming from theSecretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. KofiAnnan  who took the initiative of organizing a high-level meeting on Côte d’Ivoire on 6 July 2004 in AddisAbaba at the time of the third summit of the AfricanUnion. The major decision of that meeting was theconvening  in Accra  of a summit devoted to the crisisin the Côte d’Ivoire. The summit  known as Accra III was preceded  on the recommendation of the high-levelmeeting in Addis Ababa  by meetings of the majorjoint Ivorian/Burkina Faso and Ivorian/Maliancommissions in July 2004  and by a mini-summitwhich brought together the heads of State of Côted’Ivoire  Burkina Faso and Mali on 27 July 2004 inBamako.During those meetings  Burkina Faso  Côted’Ivoire and Mali agreed  inter alia  on the need torevitalize their cooperation in various areas  includinghuman rights; the strengthening of safe economiccorridors pending the reunification of Côte d’Ivoire;the strengthening of cooperation in security anddefence matters  especially the surveillance of borders;a commitment not to allow the territory of one State toserve as a base for the destabilization of other States ofthe subregion; and the commitment of the threecountries to work together to ensure the success of thedisarmament  demobilization and reintegrationprogramme undertaken in Côte d’Ivoire.Those various meetings between the Côted’Ivoire and its neighbours created a climate ofconfidence and in part contributed to the success of theAccra III summit  held in the capital of Ghana on29 July 2004 under the co-chairmanship of HisExcellency Mr. John Kufuor  President of Ghana andActing President of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS)  and the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan and in the presence of ten heads of State of Africa  theChairperson of the Commission of the African Unionand the Executive Secretary of ECOWAS.24In the context of the holding  in Côte d’Ivoire  ofopen  free and transparent elections in 2005  importantdecisions accompanied by a road map were made at theAccra III summit. Thus  the President of the Republic owing to the serious and continuing threats to theterritorial integrity of Côte d’Ivoire resulting from thecontinuing crisis  had to make use of the powersconferred on him by the Constitution  with a view toimplementing the provisions of section III  concerningeligibility  of the programme of the Government ofNational Reconciliation annexed to the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement  for the end of the month ofSeptember 2004.The National Assembly was due to be convenedin special session before the end of August 2004 inorder to consider and adopt all the legislative textsprovided for in the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. Thepolitical forces of Côte d’Ivoire committed themselvesto beginning the disarmament  demobilization andreintegration programme by 15 October 2004 at thelatest. Moreover  they requested that the PrimeMinister and the Government set a timetable for therestoration of State administration and public servicesthroughout national territory.As of today  the results of the reforms are asfollows:On the political level  we should note thereintegration of the three ministers who were dismissedfrom the Government of National Reconciliation andthe signing of a decree delegating powers to the PrimeMinister. Thanks to these developments  theGovernment of National Reconciliation resumed itsactivities  as shown by the meetings Council ofMinisters held since then  in which all members of theGovernment participated.On the legislative level  I am pleased to note theconvening of the deputies in a special session as of11 August 2004 to consider the most recent textsresulting from the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. Iwould like to recall that the National Assembly hasalready adopted laws on amnesty; the identification ofindividuals and the stay of foreigners in Côte d’Ivoire;the amendment of article 26 on rural land holdings; thefinancing of political parties  factions and electoralcampaigns under public funding; the declaration of thenational heritage by the President of the Republic; theratification of the additional protocol that amends andsupplements the provisions of article 7 of the protocolregarding the free movement of individuals and rightof residence and of settlement  signed in Ouagadougouon 30 June 1989; and finally  the National Committeeon Human Rights in Côte d’Ivoire. Several texts arecurrently being discussed in Parliament  and others arenot yet under the ambit of that institution. The latterinclude draft laws dealing with a revision of article 35of the constitution on criteria for eligibility for thepresidency of the Republic; the legal regime for audio-visual communication; the status of the opposition; thedeclaration of assets of elected individuals; and thesuppression of profiteering.Regarding the military  the desire for peace isclear. Thus  after a pause of several months  the so-called quadripartite meetings  which bring together thedefence and security forces and the armed forces of theForces nouvelles under the aegis of impartial forces that is  the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire(UNOCI) and Operation Licorne  have resumed.Athletic events have been taking place recentlybetween the national armed forces and those of theForces nouvelles in an atmosphere of fraternity andgood cheer. It should be recalled that  since 4 July2003  the Government forces and the armed forces ofthe Forces nouvelles have signed an agreementmarking the end of the war  and this agreement hasbeen respected since then. I would also like toemphasize that  according to the commander of theUNOCI military force  more than 90 per cent of thetroops of the United Nations peacekeeping force arealready deployed in Côte d’Ivoire. All that is needednow is military logistics support for this force to beentirely operational.Regarding the redeployment of the administrationin those areas which have been subjected to war  thisoperation is gradually continuing  to the satisfaction oflocal populations  particularly in the west of thecountry.As to alleged human rights violations followingthe crisis  Côte d’Ivoire has  out of a concern to combatimpunity  above all  indicated its will to be open to allvisits or investigations — which  in fact  it has itselfrequested — in order to appropriately asses thesituation. In this regard  I can state that Côte d’Ivoirereceived a visit in January and February 2004 from thespecial rapporteurs on freedom of opinion andexpression  the elimination of racial discrimination andmigrants and mercenaries. During their missions  theyhad full and total cooperation from the authorities in25Côte d’Ivoire. The same is true for the internationalcommission of inquiry into allegations of violations ofhuman rights of 25 and 26 March 2004  and thenational commission of inquiry set up in June 2004 toshed light on all alleged human rights violationscommitted in Côte d’Ivoire since 19 September 2002.That latter commission  which has just concluded itswork  should shed light on all allegations of humanrights violations in Côte d’Ivoire  including thoserecently committed in Korhogo.Moreover  the National Assembly of Côted’Ivoire  for its part  has established a parliamentarycommission of inquiry designed to investigate theevents of 19 December 2002 and subsequent events  inorder to achieve  we all hope  genuine peace andreconciliation. National peace and reconciliation areincompatible with impunity. The internationalcommunity should therefore assist Côte d’Ivoire inidentifying the perpetrators of human rights andinternational humanitarian law violations in order tobring them to justice before the competent authorities.We are starting afresh; we can now lay down theburden of our past concerns to embark on the path ofhope. All citizens of Côte d’Ivoire without exceptionare determined to silence those rivalries that onlyspawn hate and rancour and to pool our efforts in theservice of peace through dialogue. This is why we arecounting on the ongoing support of the internationalcommunity for our efforts at consolidating inter-Ivorian dialogue  the principal means for a restorationof confidence  peace and national reconciliation.The Government of Côte d’Ivoire therefore takesnote of the statement to the press today by thePresident of the Security Council on the situation inCôte d’Ivoire  a statement that our Governmentconsiders as a step forward to finding a rapid solutionto the crisis. Côte d’Ivoire is also counting on theassistance of international financial institutions and ofdeveloped countries for the implementation of thenational programme of reconstruction and  inparticular  of disarmament  demobilization andreintegration.Allow me to indicate here that the security indexof the United Nations at its present level isunfortunately a factor that is not facilitating contactsand therefore the start of negotiations withinternational financial institutions. A review that wouldlower this level would be most welcome.I would like to take advantage of this opportunityto reiterate yet once again the gratitude of the peopleand the Government of Côte d’Ivoire to theinternational community  in particular to France  theUnited States  Canada  all other friendly countries  theUnited Nations  the International Organization of laFrancophonie  the European Union  the African Unionand ECOWAS for their invaluable contributions  whichhave made it possible to overcome so many obstaclesto date.The situation in Côte d’Ivoire is not preventing usfrom seeing what is taking place elsewhere  above allon the African continent. The West African subregionis facing crises in Liberia  Guinea-Bissau  Sierra Leoneand Côte d’Ivoire. Glimmers of hope for shortlyputting an end to these situations do exist  but thatoptimism is clearly tempered by the continuation ofsuch scourges as trafficking in children  drugtrafficking  trafficking in small arms  mercenaries child soldiers and terrorism  to name only these few.Thus  the strengthening of a coordinated battle againstthese scourges  under the aegis of ECOWAS and withthe assistance of the international community  isnecessary.Côte d’Ivoire is a party to all existing conflictprevention and management mechanisms and intendsto be fully involved in all initiatives undertaken topromote peace and stability on the global  continentaland regional level. In that framework  it is contributingto the drawing up of a strategy for a pacification andstabilization of the West African region. The situationin the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Burundi Darfur in Somalia  the Middle East  and Iraq cannot beignored and require sustained attention on the part ofthe international community. They also undeniablydemonstrate the need for a strengthening ofmultilateralism in the settlement of the conflictsbattering the world.Regarding a reform of the United Nations  andparticularly reform of the Security Council  I shouldlike to reaffirm the support of Côte d’Ivoire for theshared African position  voiced several times here fromthis rostrum  in favour of an expanded SecurityCouncil with two permanent seats and three other non-permanent seats for Africa.The countries of the Third World  which mustcope with numerous difficulties  clearly cannot achievethe Millennium Development Goals while 2015 is26rapidly approaching. However  far from beingovercome by defeatism  Africa has acquired a newinstrument for development  the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD)  and itsrecommendations are integrated into national andsubregional development and anti-poverty strategies.The African continent awaits the internationalcommunity’s implementation of commitments resultingfrom the major international conferences  in particularthose undertaken by the Group of Eight for NEPAD.I would like to conclude my remarks with anappeal for solidarity to all  given the numerous dangersthreatening peace and international security. In thatcontext  Côte d’Ivoire urges respect for commitmentsand peace agreements concluded together by all States.In the view of my country  this active and relentlesscommitment to preventing conflicts includes at leastthree elements: preventive diplomacy  based on asystem of early warning; education for peace; and finally  the struggle against poverty in order to ensuresustainable development. Therefore  once theconditions for a peaceful existence have thus beenfulfilled  the entire world will be able to move forwardtowards a world of shared well-being and happiness."
"35",1401,"CMR",59,2004,"On 10 June 2004  you  Mr. President  were elected toserve as President of the General Assembly.

Your election crowns an outstandingcareer and is a tribute to Gabon’s diplomacy under thewise guidance of President El Hadj Omar BongoOndimba.Cameroon would also like to congratulate theother members of the Bureau of the fifty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly. We would like to reiterateour full cooperation to you  Mr. President  and to saythat we are at your disposal. In addition  I would like totake this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Julian Hunte  for the important work heaccomplished with the tireless support of the Bureau including in particular with regard to our commonendeavour to reform the Organization and enhance itseffectiveness by  among other things  reviewing theGeneral Assembly’s methods of work.The waning year has strengthened our commonresolve to strengthen multilateralism and to give itprominence in the management of international affairsin the new international order  with the United Nationsas the foundation and framework of that order. Despitethe ups and downs that the United Nations hasexperienced  in particular in the Security Council  it istime for there to be an active dialogue among theworld’s nations  all of which adhere to the universalityof the Organization and its unique and irreplaceablerole in promoting economic and social developmentand international peace and security. The world ofcourse faces numerous challenges  some of which arenew in nature. Others  however  although older andbetter known  remain without real solutions — eitherdue to their complexity or because of a lack ofdetermination on the part of the internationalcommunity to mobilize ways and means commensuratewith the stakes.In January 2005  the General Assembly willreceive a report from the Panel of eminent personsappointed by the Secretary-General to reflect onreforms that could make the Organization moreeffective  transparent and democratic  as well as betterable to carry out its mission and tackle the newchallenges requiring our attention. I trust that the Panelwill not fail to rely upon previous relevant proposalswhen framing its recommendations  in particular thosemade at the Millennium Summit. As far as Cameroonis concerned  mankind must be at the heart of anysubstantive reform of the United Nations.My country continues to promote the proposalput forth here in New York during the MillenniumSummit by President Paul Biya. That proposal calledfor the creation within the Secretariat of an28international ethics-monitoring centre entrusted withthe task of “promoting fundamental and universalhuman values between and within nations”. (A/55/PV.5 p. 27)In addition  it also seems that the time has comefor the General Assembly to express its views on theissue of Security Council reform  and in particular withregard to expanding its membership. The proposals thathave been introduced in the General Assembly areundoubtedly a very good basis for discussion. TheAssembly will recall that the Organization of AfricanUnity called for a reconstituted Security Council thatincluded seven seats for Africa  including 2 permanentseats. That proposal  which Cameroon fully endorses still stands. Nevertheless  we must forge concreteconsensus without delay  as an indicator of greatertransparency and renewed legitimacy of a SecurityCouncil that is more effective and credible.Standing side-by-side with other nations Cameroon is resolutely committed to eradicating newthreats that seriously imperil international peace andsecurity. We unreservedly condemn internationalterrorism and all forms of fundamentalism andextremism  which provide it with both a breedingground and a vehicle. It is for that reason that wereiterate our solidarity with all those who have fallenvictim to terrorism  most recently in Russia and theMiddle East.The efforts undertaken by the Security Council inthat regard are encouraging. However  we believe thatthe time has come for worldwide globalization and thesummit level. It is time to act together against theterrorist hydra. Cameroon once again suggests that ahigh-level conference be urgently convened to definecollectively more effective strategies to combatterrorism.The new threats confronting the world are realchallenges  and it is only right that they be givencertain priority. That approach will be quite appropriateas the Organization’s other traditional concernscontinue to enjoy our full attention. Cameroon believesthat nothing can justify terrorism. Nevertheless  theresponse to terrorism and to other new threats cannotbe solely a military response.The modern world must focus on the causes ofviolence and on the injustices that undermineinternational peace. Resolving regional conflicts inAfrica  the Middle East and elsewhere; combatingpoverty and mobilizing against great epidemics  andagainst HIV/AIDS in particular; redressing theimbalance in world trade in goods and services; andaddressing the foreign debt of poor countries — likethe new threats  all these challenges require theOrganization’s attention.I mention this parallel because we run a real risk today  of getting used to the endemic poverty that killsthousands every day  particularly in sub-SaharanAfrica. Solidarity with the poor must become a veryconcrete reality rather than mere lip service. In order tocombat hunger and poverty  we need massive privateand public financing. We need relief from the burdenof debt.The world today is faced with a paradox. Thepoorest countries are the ones that have the most openand liberal economies. Even their non-commercialsector has been privatized  causing unemployment formillions of citizens and the destabilization of basicsocial sectors  such as water and electricity  for manyyears  with harmful consequences for all economicactivity. The current economic order  if we are notcareful  could consolidate — and indeed makepermanent — current relations based on force  to thebenefit of rich countries and to the detriment of poorcountries. The rich can easily subsidize theiragriculture  their industry and their airlines  amongother sectors. The poor countries  however  under thewatchful eyes of financial institutions in which theirvoices go unheard  must submit themselves to the lawof the market. Cotton from West and Central Africa isa perfect example of unbalanced and unfairglobalization. We should not become discouraged however  and Cameroon is convinced that under yourpresidency  Sir  the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly will adopt strong initiatives to help poorcountries and to ensure a readjustment of globalization making it more equitable and beneficial to all.International economic relations must be profoundlyreformed with a view to ensuring greater UnitedNations involvement.The same issues that apply to the economy alsoapply to the subject of health. The world  viewed in itsentirety  is rich. It has the means of providing adequatehealth for all. Medicines exist that should make itpossible to contain the major pandemics. Researchscientists and the pharmaceutical industry are makinggreat strides on a daily basis in combating malaria tuberculosis  meningitis and cholera  among otherdiseases. Those scourges  however  kill millions ofAfricans every year. The reason for this is poverty andinsufficient means to obtain care and medicines.29With regard to HIV/AIDS  which is far moreterrible since it is thus far incurable  we welcome thefact that scientific research today is making it possibleto drastically diminish its devastating scope. TheBangkok International AIDS Conference has certainlygiven reason for hope. Significant pledges to helperadicate this scourge are announced on a daily basis.Unfortunately  most of the persons infected by the HIVvirus are unable to obtain anti-retroviral medicationssince they lack the necessary financial means.Combating AIDS is a worldwide cause  rallying us all.I have touched upon regional conflicts. Theirnegative impact on the international environment whether politically  economically or in humanitarianand security terms  requires no further demonstration.Africa  as if not already handicapped enough  is thecontinent most plagued by conflict  as evidenced by theSecurity Council agenda.The situation in some countries gives rise torelative optimism. Developments in Liberia  SierraLeone  Guinea-Bissau and the Comoros give us reasonsfor hope. Recent firm commitments by political actorsin the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire doubtless give rise tobetter prospects for that fraternal  friendly country.In Central Africa  despite some improvement  thesituation remains worrisome. It calls for constantvigilance and increased involvement on all levels bythe international community. In this respect  theinternational conference on the Great Lakes region which has been announced several times but hasalways been deferred  must finally be held asscheduled in November 2004. That will make itpossible to lay a fresh foundation for constructivecooperation among the countries of the region consistent with the interests of their respective peoples.Still with regard to Central Africa  it is our hopethat  at this session  the debate on cooperation betweenthe United Nations and the Economic Community ofCentral African States (ECCAS) will address theconcerns expressed by our subregion’s heads of Stateto the Secretary-General’s multidisciplinary assessmentmission to Central Africa. I recall here that the headsof State had unanimously and firmly expressed a desirefor a political presence by the Secretary-General inCentral Africa through a permanent subregionalstructure. We take note of the statement made here inthis connection by the delegation of the Republic of theCongo  as Chairman of ECCAS.The crisis in Darfur is currently a matter of graveconcern on our continent. Wishing to prevent acatastrophe such as has occurred in the past  theAfrican Union has squarely embraced this questionwith the decisive support of the Security Council andother international partners. We all hope a positivesolution will be reached quickly. In order to do this dialogue must be ongoing  forward-looking andvoluntary on the part of all protagonists in the crisis.To be sure  the political will and determination of theSudanese authorities are key; they must continue todisplay these qualities. That is the only way that anunprecedented humanitarian catastrophe will beavoided. In any case  the international community mustbe further mobilized behind the African Union in orderto ward off this curse and avert this major crisiswithout delay.My country is profoundly devoted to peace. Itwill spare no effort to promote the peaceful settlementof disputes. In that connection  it will continue topromote peace throughout the world  and specificallyin Africa  in Central Africa and in the Gulf of Guinea.As members know  the International Court ofJustice in The Hague  after lengthy deliberationslasting almost 10 years  handed down its judgment  on10 October 2002  relating to the boundary disputebetween Cameroon and Nigeria. Both countries  withinthe context of the Joint Commission established by theSecretary-General and chaired by his SpecialRepresentative  have agreed to define the ways andmeans of implementing that judgment and haveadopted a programme of work with a specifictimetable  approved on 31 January 2004 by their headsof State and the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General has eloquently reported on the progress thathas been made in this connection. We call upon theUnited Nations family to give its full support to theSecretary-General and to use its influence to helpNigeria and Cameroon in implementing the judgmentof the International Court of Justice.Whether it be the reform of our Organization tomake it more efficient  democratic and legitimate; orthe Middle East peace process to re-launch the roadmap; or pacification  reconstruction  enhanced securityand institution-building in Iraq and Afghanistan; or thesettlement of African disputes and the post-conflictreconstruction of such countries; or combating AIDSand other pandemics; or adjusting financial and trademechanisms to help the weakest and most exposedcountries; or  finally  eliminating poverty:Mr. President  our dear brother  we think that you havea full plate. Quite fortunately  your great qualities will30allow you to involve the international community inworking on these problems.Moreover  you have at your side the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kofi Annan  NobelPeace Prize laureate  whose actions and commitmentsto promote peace  security and development todayserve as both a lever and an engine for the activitiesundertaken by the international community as a whole.You also have at your side  I am sure  the entirety ofthe United Nations membership. Cameroon  for itspart  will spare no effort to support you in your loftymission."
"36",1445,"COD",59,2004,"At this time when I have the honour to take the floor before thisaugust Assembly  above all I would like to express toyou  on behalf of the Congolese people as well as onmy own behalf  my warm congratulations to Mr. JeanPing on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly as well as the election of the members of hisBureau.I also take this occasion to congratulate and givemy continued support to Mr. Julian Hunte  thePresident of the previous General Assembly  for thesignificant quality of the work he accomplished duringa difficult international situation.This debate provides me the opportunity to bringthe message of my country to the world — a messageof peace and national reconciliation — and to expressour vision concerning the violent events taking place inthe world and the most appropriate way to find lastingsolutions to those events.In that respect  looking back at worlddevelopments  we can only note and deplore the rise ininternational terrorism in all its forms with its long lineof victims  distress and desolation. This appears to meto be the appropriate time to announce that mycountry’s commitment to the ratification of allinternational legal instruments on terrorism is movinginto its final phase of adoption. Our aim is to combatthat scourge which — I repeat — spares no one.Apart from terrorism  the internationalcommunity is confronted with the resurgence of otherdisasters which are just as murderous and devastatingand which require us to strengthen our collectiveefforts. In particular I am thinking of HIV/AIDS malaria  tuberculosis and other endemic diseases.That list of forgotten diseases should not obscurethe immense poverty and the natural disasters that wesee throughout the world. Moreover  we must notforget the areas of tension  civil wars and other armedconflicts which increase the misery and hopelessnessof humanity and which thus sorely test internationalpeace and security.During the intersessional period  the situation inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has beencharacterized by a process of political transition. In thelong term  we plan to organize elections which willenable the Congolese people to freely choose theirleaders. In that respect  I would like to point out thatthat process reached its midway point on 30 June 2004.It has thus entered a decisive phase which requiresfrom all institutions of the transition a redoubling ofeffort in order to meet the electoral deadlines as laidout in the global agreement.Today we can congratulate ourselves on thefollowing significant progress: the reunification ofnational territory through the setting up of a landcommission under central authority; nationalreconciliation  symbolized by the presence in theGovernment of former enemies; and the beginning ofthe process of integration of the army and theestablishment of the national police force.Nevertheless  much remains to be done  includingthe complete restoration of the authority of the Statethroughout the country and the establishment of thenecessary internal and external conditions for theholding of the aforementioned elections.Thus  taking into account the desire for peace ofall of the Congolese people  and the determinationexpressed many times by the transitional Governmentto respect the deadlines  it is important that wereinforce  in terms of quality and quantity  the UnitedNations Organization Mission in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo (MONUC)  whose support ofthe forces of order will help us put an end to the30activism of the militias which continue to sow deathand desolation in the eastern part of the country. Inaddition  given the results obtained by the politicalplayers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in thefulfilment of their obligations under the globalagreement  we launch an urgent appeal to theinternational community and ask it to respect itspromises and commitments in bringing about theobjectives of the transition.The Democratic Republic of the Congo is apeace-loving country  resolutely committed todeveloping  maintaining and promoting excellentrelations with all countries dedicated to peace andjustice and particularly  with its neighbours.Also the principle of good neighbourliness  farfrom being a simple slogan  is for us a living and dailyreality. That is why I am happy to see the signature ofthe terms of reference  establishing a joint verificationmechanism on the eastern border of our nationalterritory. This will enable us to rebuild trust in relationsin the region  a process which will culminate in theinternational conference on peace  security anddevelopment  scheduled to take place shortly.The other major task in the Great Lakes regionremains preventing a recurrence of unfortunate events such as the massacres of the people in Bukuvu  Ituriand those recently committed in Gatumba  Burundi during which 160 of our fellow citizens tragically losttheir lives. This assassination of Congolese refugees onBurundian soil is the work of the enemies of peace andof peaceful cohabitation in our subregion. The peopleof Congo are waiting impatiently for the report of theinquiry being prepared under United Nations auspiceson this very subject.I solemnly express the Congolese people’s faithin the United Nations  which has stood at our side atthe cost of many sacrifices. We firmly believe in itsability to take even more responsibility on itsshoulders  with a view to the ideas and principlescontained in the Charter  particularly with regard to itsprocess of revitalization and the adaptation of itsstructures so that it is able to rethink its workingmethods in order that we will see peace  security andpeaceful cohabitation come about among peoplesthroughout the world.I would like to conclude my statement byassuring the Assembly of our will to bring to asuccessful conclusion  with the help of the whole of theinternational community  the process of transitionwithin the set deadlines so that the sons and daughtersof the Democratic Republic of the Congo are able tolive again in peace and dignity so long denied themand to which they legitimately have the right."
"37",1492,"COG",59,2004,"Theelection of Mr. Jean Ping to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session does honourto our continent  to our subregion of Central Africa andto his country  Gabon. I congratulate him sincerely onbehalf of my delegation. We are familiar with Mr.Ping’s high sense of duty  his selfless dedication to hiswork and his great skill  and we have no doubt that —like his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunteof Saint Lucia — he will spare no effort to meet ourexpectations.To the Secretary-General we say how much weappreciate his initiatives and his tireless efforts tomake the Organization more effective.At the Millennium Summit  Member States madesolemn and very important commitments. Today despite the fact that some progress has been made inimplementing the Millennium Development Goals  thesituation remains troubling. The assessment of theimplementation of the Goals scheduled for 2005 is thusof particular importance. Here  we support allinitiatives that would give fresh impetus tointernational cooperation to combat poverty andhunger. I am thinking in particular of the initiative ofHis Excellency President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ofthe Federative Republic of Brazil  which rightlyfocuses on the Millennium Development Goals and onthe Monterrey Consensus. The African Union’sExtraordinary Summit on Employment and PovertyAlleviation in Africa  held on 8 and 9 September inOuagadougou  Burkina Faso  was also intended toaddress those concerns.In spite of all the problems that have hobbled theDoha round of multilateral trade negotiations  theresumption of negotiations this summer in Genevagives us some reason to hope for the establishment ofequitable rules of international trade. We continue tohope for greater equity and solidarity among poor andrich nations with a view to achieving globalization thatis fair. We therefore support the recommendations ofthe World Commission on the Social Dimension ofGlobalization.To meet the Millennium Development Goals  wealso need peace and security — which  unfortunately are lacking in a number of regions. The situation in theMiddle East continues to concern us. Peace  thatfundamental aspiration  remains beyond the grasp of46the peoples of the region; it is our joint responsibilityto put in place the conditions for lasting peace.In Africa  the attention of the internationalcommunity remains focused on the too-great number ofcrises. To be sure  we can be pleased at recentdevelopments in the situation in Côte d’Ivoire following the Accra III summit  but we must continueto work to make the process irreversible.In the Sudan  the Darfur crisis continues to be ofgreat concern  in both its humanitarian and its politicaldimensions. A greater mobilization by the internationalcommunity is required to support the efforts of theAfrican Union. The objective is to avoid a disaster andto ensure peace for the people of the Sudan.In our subregion of Central Africa  we werepleased with the positive outcome on 12 July 2004 ofthe national forum held in Sao Tome and Principe scheduled under the Memorandum of Understanding dated 23 July 2003  and concluded under the auspicesof the Economic Community of Central African States the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries  theAfrican Union  the United States of America andNigeria.In the Central African Republic  where there isstill a peacekeeping force of the Central AfricanEconomic and Monetary Community  supportedlogistically by France  our hope is to see thedemocratic process move forward and proceed to thegeneral elections which are scheduled for 2005.We welcome the efforts of the internationalcommunity in Burundi — in particular  the SouthAfrican mediation — for the results achieved to date.We call upon the political leaders of that country toremain focused on the national interests. Unity anddevelopment in Burundi depend on that.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo political life in the eastern part of the country inparticular has recently been marked by a number ofgrave events such as the Ituri crisis  the Bukavurebellion and the Gatumba massacres. We renew oursupport for the global and inclusive agreement  as wellas for the institutions for transition.We call on the international community tocontinue to pay all the attention required to thatcountry  and we support all initiatives that wouldincrease troop strength and the means of action of theUnited Nations Organization Mission in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. It is in that contextthat we are pleased with today’s signature of the termsof reference of the joint oversight mechanism betweenthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda.That overview of the political situation in oursubregion  which includes a number of countries inpost-conflict situations  fully justifies the request ofCentral Africa to have a United Nations office. We arepleased with the existence of the United NationsStanding Advisory Committee on Questions ofSecurity in Central Africa and  in particular  the workgiven to that Committee. We wish to continue to havethe input of the Committee in its relations with thecompetent bodies of the subregion  in light of what isat stake.Similarly  we expect implementation of theconclusions of the multifaceted mission that wasdispatched to Central Africa in June 2003 by theSecretary-General. We appreciate those conclusions asbeing very relevant  especially those establishingprogrammes for disarmament  demobilization andreintegration to help consolidate the peace processestaking place; helping to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS;stopping the circulation of small arms and lightweapons; protecting the environment and creatingconditions for development in Central Africa.In order to meet all of the challenges and toestablish all the conditions required for stability  we areplacing our hopes on the international conference forpeace  security  democracy and development in theGreat Lakes region  preparations for which are alreadyunder way. That conference will undoubtedly be anexcellent opportunity to search for lasting solutions tothe recurrent crises that cause bloodshed in the region.I reiterate my country’s willingness to make itscontribution to that process.As you know  the Republic of the Congo isamong the countries in our subregion which is in apost-conflict situation. Under the leadership ofPresident Denis Sassou-Nguesso  Congo isendeavouring at the same time  to consolidate peaceand to re-establish a comprehensive macroeconomicequilibrium.Among our current priorities  the question ofdisarmament  demobilization and reintegrationcontinues to be very important. Our nationalprogramme concerning those issues will  for the 2004-2006 period  involve more than 40 000 ex-combatants.47The efforts of the Government  which are supported —and we appreciate that support — by the EuropeanUnion  the United Nations Development Programmeand the World Bank  will be continued. We would alsoappreciate any other contribution that would help theCongolese Government resolve that thorny issue.Additionally  Congo  in hoping to benefit fromthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative  isvery sensitive to the decisions taken in Paris on 9 and14 September 2004  respectively  by the Paris Club andthe donors. Here I reiterate the appreciation of myGovernment for those efforts. Congo’s eligibility forthat Initiative will undoubtedly allow us to allocate amajority of our resources for development andtherefore to follow up with what was contained in ourPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper  which we expectwill be validated by the International Monetary Fundand the World Bank.That would help us succeed in our efforts  withinour national plan  concerning good governance andtransparency in the management of our national affairs.Therefore  in following up on those various objectives our country has joined the African Peer ReviewMechanism under the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment and we have signed on to the ExtractiveIndustries Transparency Initiative.Concerning the environment  we are involved in apartnership with the international communityconcerning the Congo Basin Initiative. Brazzaville willshortly host a summit that will consider plans toconserve the forests of this world heritage area. Wetherefore welcome the support given to that plan byFrance  the United Nations  the European Union  theUnited States  Germany  South Africa and a number ofnon-governmental organizations.Congo reiterates its support for multilateralism.We remain convinced that the United Nations is theideal framework for meeting the challenges that facethe world. But the world has changed. New challengesare before us that require reforms that will allow theUnited Nations to adapt itself to current missions andthe global configuration of the twenty-first century.We therefore welcome the reform processundertaken by the Secretary-General and are trulyhopeful regarding the recommendations of the high-level panel which was set up to examine the principlethreats and challenges to collective peace and securityand to make proposals with respect to reform of theinternational system.Among the reforms expected  we firmly supportthe idea of enlarging the Security Council in its twocomponents  namely  permanent and non-permanentmembers. We must take into account — among otherthings — the diversity of today’s world in order tohighlight the criteria of geographical representationand of responsibility in the management of worldwideaffairs  without ever sacrificing effectiveness cohesion  transparency or credibility.As was stated by the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan  in his statement tothe General Assembly at the 3rd meeting  on21 September  “today  more than ever  the world needsan effective mechanism through which to seek commonsolutions to common problems.” In order do this  wemust not only act together in complying with the rulesthat we ourselves have implemented  but we must alsocomply with the commitments we have made."
"38",1539,"COL",59,2004,"I amaddressing the General Assembly once again  at a timewhen the people and the institutions of Colombia aremaking great progress in their struggle to achievedemocratic security. Such security would enable allcitizens to live in peace  express their political viewswithout putting their lives in danger and to support oroppose the Government while fully respecting differentopinions.That policy has made significant progress inreducing murders  kidnappings and other terrorist acts as well as population displacement and the growing ofillicit drug crops. There is still a great deal to be done but if we are persistent we will prevail.Democratic security is one of Colombia’s highestpriorities if we are to regain credibility and if ourcitizens are once again to have confidence in ourinstitutions. When trust is destroyed  the ties betweenthe citizen and the nation are broken. Such trustrequires transparency in public and private actions  aswell as economic revitalization and social cohesion.Social cohesion builds trust among citizens andbetween citizens and the State. Social cohesion is theenemy of poverty and helps to promote equalopportunities. Colombia has established a legalframework to ensure that the benefits of economicgrowth lead to poverty eradication. Yet Colombia’sgrowth  which during the 1960s and 1970s wasaveraging 4.5 per cent a year  fell to an average of 2per cent after 1980. That decline encouraged theinformal economy  and was accompanied by poverty.The contrast became increasingly obvious between theformal private sector — which was fair with itsworkers and complied with its tax payments  but whichgrew at a slow pace — and the informal sector  which with its overwhelming influence  drew in the destitutemasses.Drug trafficking  which bankrolls terrorism reversed the trend towards land distribution  throughagrarian reform and the natural process of inheritancefrom one generation to the next.Between 1994 and 2000  unemployment amongheads of household grew from 4 per cent to 10 percent  and overall unemployment grew from 7.5 per centto 19 per cent. In relatively few years  the deficit2increased from 1.5 per cent to 4.2 per cent of the grossdomestic product (GDP)  public debt rose from 24 percent to 54 per cent of GDP and 40 per cent of thepublic budget was allocated to debt servicing andrepayment. Very low levels of private investment onlymade the situation worse.Defeating poverty requires strong and sustainedeconomic growth. This in turn requires physical andlegal security  transparent regulations andmacroeconomic stability. Last year  Colombia forecastgrowth of 2.5 per cent — but growth was close to 4 percent. This year we are endeavouring to achieve 5 percent growth. We are able to do because we arerestoring confidence among investors. With suchgrowth  unemployment has fallen three points although it is still quite high. A positive sign is thatjobs are being created in sectors that will provide forsocial security and fair wages for workers. All that hashappened despite fiscal restrictions to publicinvestment and in the midst of an intense struggle toeliminate illicit drugs  which have become sosignificant that they now affect whether there will bepositive or negative growth in our agricultural sector.At one time  my generation explained violence asthe result of social inequities. My country’s experienceover many decades allows me to affirm that terroristviolence has increased poverty and has destroyed thepossibility of eliminating social inequity. Violence hasworsened poverty and has exploited it to perpetuateitself.Our goal is to reduce poverty at a rate equal to orhigher than economic growth. To a great extent  oursocial investment programme depends on sound andsustained economic growth. Therefore  our socialinvestment programme goes hand in hand with ourdemocratic security policy. If we neglect securitymeasures that respect democratic values  terrorism willgrow  we will lose momentum in defeating it investment will be affected  the strength of oureconomic recovery will weaken and we could be leftwithout resources for social investment.Today’s equality lies in economic and socialopportunity. That is why we have placed so muchemphasis on education. We have increased elementaryschool enrolment by 750 000  but the country stillneeds classroom space for 1.25 million new pupils. In25 months we have increased technical training by twoand a half times  promoting basic employment skills toenable young people to join the work force whilecontinuing their studies. In the cities and in thecountryside  we have been carrying out a silentrevolution in technical training that will reach 4million young people a year by 2006.A subsidy is being paid to 340 000 poor familiesto improve their children’s nutrition and ensure schoolattendance. There are now 503 000 children in the newbreakfast programme for children under five; thatnumber will double in 2005. That  together with theschool cafeterias and the “Community Mothers”programme  will reach more than 6 million childrenunder various nutrition programmes.By December  when this Administration willhave been in office for 28 months  more than 4 millionpoor Colombians will have enrolled in the subsidizedhealth programme  in addition to the 13 million whowere already protected. We are carrying out legal andadministrative reforms to increase coverage  withimproved transparency and an effective and efficientuse of resources.Colombia has more than 600 000 senior adultsliving in extreme poverty. In the past  60 000 of themreceived a cash subsidy. This year  we have raised thenumber to 172 000 of our elderly compatriots. We arenow starting a new programme to deliver one meal aday to 400 000 more who do not receive the cashsubsidy. In addition  this year we are paying more than$100 million in subsidies to provide electricity to low-income members of the population.We are also subsidizing more than 7 000reintegrated former members of various violent groups.This is part of a huge  silent  but effective peaceprocess. When one of those persons is reintegrated  hesees the support of the State and the community reconciles himself with civic institutions  embracesdemocracy and coexistence and rejects any justificationfor violence. We hope that many more thousands willfollow  but we will require international cooperationfor this programme.We are subsidizing 21 000 forest ranger families who were formerly involved in illicit drug crops andare now committed to eliminating them and torecovering their tropical forests. Their task is essentialfor mankind  considering Colombia’s rich biodiversityand its 578 000 square kilometres of jungle  which arethreatened by illicit drugs. To guarantee their foodsecurity  we are also subsidizing 700 000 farmers  and3that number will soon reach 1 million; we are alsosubsidizing the crops of farmers’ associations until theybecome productive and competitive. Poverty indicatorsshould take account of such subsidies  which areusually not included when measuring the income ofthose families.Colombia has suffered a tragedy in the form ofinternal displacement. We have reduced its incidenceby 40 per cent  but it is still high. We have facilitatedthe return of more 70 000 people and we expect thatnumber to increase. One State agency alone hasmultiplied eightfold its budget to care for displacedpersons.As a result of a law approved at the beginning ofthis Government’s tenure  the process for “ownershipextinction” for illegally acquired assets has movedmore quickly. We expect that that mechanism will beused to advance constructive agrarian reform.By paying additional taxes  the Colombian peopleare making an effort to finance security measures andrestore social investment levels  for a total thatrepresents 2 per cent of our gross domestic product. Wehave received the support of the multilateral banks  butwe require greater understanding from the financialmarkets: longer-term loans and lower interest rates. Weare engaged in an intense struggle  and we need betteraccess to the markets of the industrialized countries.I would like to reaffirm Colombia’s commitmentto multilateralism. Multilateralism must continuouslyimprove if it is to become more effective and restorethe lost consensus for safeguarding international peace.Building that consensus requires each State to feel thatit is being heard and that it is being taken into account.I am grateful for the support of the UnitedNations agencies in social matters. We are fullyprepared to back the efforts of the internationalcommunity to consolidate democracy and security inthe region  especially in Haiti. Colombia will be part ofthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. Wewill cooperate with police experts in the fight againstdrug trafficking  as well as with the humanitarianpresence.Mr. Baali (Algeria)  Vice-President  took theChair.We must all join in an effective internationalsolidarity movement with our Caribbean brothers  whoare so seriously affected by the hurricane season.We need the total commitment of theinternational community in the struggle againstterrorism in Colombia. Terrorism in one country feedsand strengthens terrorist networks throughout theworld. The widows and orphans of violence in ourcountry ask why we attach so much importance toterrorism in other parts of the world  and why someattach so little to the terrorism that besets Colombia. Imake this appeal from the depths of our profounddemocratic conviction. It is difficult to find anothercountry facing such a challenge of terrorism whilesimultaneously strengthening its democracy.Today  Colombia offer effective guarantees forthe exercise of political pluralism by means of ourdemocratic security policy. Our institutions combatterrorism with the unflinching political will of theGovernment. They do so with courage  selflessness andtransparency. A dirty war has no place in our policies.A democratic State has the right to ask the worldto demand that the terrorists return their kidnap victimsrather than clamouring for lopsided agreements withterrorists. We ask the world for more decisive and moreeffective support. If it is broadened  the violent groupswill have no option but to abandon terrorism and toaccept peace.With the people of Colombia  its democraticinstitutions and the international community united  wecan make Colombia an example of the capacity todefeat terrorism and observe human rights. And we canmake Colombia an example of the ability to defeatterrorism and of the will to build social justice.We will expel terror with the help of legitimateinstitutions and of a community of solidarity andjustice  with opportunities for its poorest members."
"39",1579,"COM",59,2004,"Mr. President  allow me at the outset  on behalf of thedelegation of the Comoros and on my own behalf  tocongratulate you warmly on your election to presideover the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Your task is by no means an easy one but it is an honour to you personally  to your countryand to the entire African continent. No otherorganization can boast of that universal mission. Iwould therefore like to assure you of the full readinessof my delegation to work with you for the success ofthat noble mission in the service of peace and securityin the world.My delegation welcomes the way in which yourpredecessor guided the work at the fifty-eighth session.On behalf of the Comoros I hail the tirelesscommitment and complete availability of theSecretary-General in the fight he leads to advance theideals of peace  social justice  development andfreedom throughout the world.The world — a world of peace and vision Of ideas and union now unfurled A world that has divided landsAnd with seas that share their sands;World of tolerance and knowing World abundance  overflowing;World of peace  world that charmed No  world; you cannot be harmed.Nations unity provided But hearts tend to be divided.For we have met each other And yet our peoples live in fear.Children of the world and countries of the world 24Where is the world?What is this world?Borders here do not exist;Prayers vanish in the mist.Terror is their daily lot;Fear is all that they have got.Killers rule instead of bread.Millennium world  world so fair Yet a world of billionaires;World of speeches of all sortsWithin fora  and of courts.World rejecting our solutionsand denying resolutions.What a world. What a peace.While the world is slowly forging ahead in thisthird millennium  we are obliged to note that thefeelings of our respective peoples are fluctuatingbetween hope and concern. Indeed  while therelationship between peace and development isbecoming increasingly justified and is making themindivisible  the path of world events is tending to callthis into question. It is indeed true that there can be nopeace and no security in the world as long as hundredsof millions of individuals are still prisoners ofdestitution and poverty and still do not have theminimum necessary for a decent daily life. Nor canthere be peace and security in the world as long as working all together  we have not made the requiredefforts to save the hundreds of millions of human livesthreatened by the scourges of AIDS and otherpandemics.Moreover  what kind of peace can there be in aworld that makes the spread of weapons and theproliferation of hotbeds of tension the very pattern ofits existence and the means for its evolution?These are the problems before us  this forum withthe highest priority mission of seeing to the properconduct of world affairs  the prosperity and flourishingof the human race and to the control of the globalenvironment by our actions  which must serve thecause and the welfare of each and every people  eachnation and each citizen of the world.That is why it is incumbent on the UnitedNations  today more than ever  to play fully its role asdefined by the Charter. This role is one of vanguardaction  of mediation par excellence  of stimulus and ofpromotion of the remarkable accomplishments wroughtevery day by the progress of science.For that reason  my country says “no” to poverty “no” to AIDS and other pandemics  “no” to terrorismand “yes” to the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. In order to combat the scourges ofpoverty  major diseases and terrorism  we need a firmand determined will to work for development.The Millennium Summit  in which all theforemost leaders of our planet participated  took fullnote of that reality. The Millennium Declaration set outthe steps and the course to follow in order toeffectively direct the world’s development andprogressively correct the problems identified. TheDeclaration established 2015 as the deadline forreviewing the plan of action that each country mustimplement  in a collective resolve to get the world backon track.The Union of the Comoros endorses theMillennium Development Goals. While working forprogress in the national reconciliation process  theGovernment of my country  like all other members ofthe community of nations  has made the necessaryefforts to establish a poverty reduction strategy. Today that document to which all active forces in our countrycontributed  constitutes the instrument panel of ourdevelopment priorities.In order for the Comoros to act on thosedevelopment priorities  it requires the assistance of theinternational community. It was only this past Aprilthat my country finally completed the establishment ofits institutions  thus bringing to a close the separatistand institutional crisis that for seven years had shakenthe foundations of our State.In particular  we hope that the entire internationalcommunity will support the African Union’s call issued at the recent summit at Addis Ababa  for aninternational donors round-table meeting to be held toassist the convalescent Comoros. This would enable itto recover and by stages to rejoin the other nations inworking at the subregional  continental and globallevels to achieve sustainable development  which isnow its greatest priority.The firm national commitment of all MemberStates of the international community is required toachieve the Millennium Development Goals. This25militates in favour of the enhanced representation ofcontinents and peoples in the United Nations.We should therefore consider increasing thepermanent membership of the Security Council toinclude  for example  the Republic of India  Japan  theFederal Republic of Germany and the FederativeRepublic of Brazil. The African continent and the Arabworld also deserve appropriate representation on theSecurity Council. That is the way to achieve equity and equity is desperately needed for there to be greaterjustice and peace in the world. That appears to be whatmust be done today to create the necessary balance forcontrol of the international order and the globalenvironment  which have never been so unstable anduncertain.In the eternal search for peace  social justice andprosperity  the fate of small island States  which faceso many threats to their survival  must not remain injeopardy. Let us be fully aware that numerous countriesare destined to disappear because of such hazards asrising sea-levels  desertification  cyclones and volcaniceruptions. Accordingly  we must consider specificactions for each of those States. We urge theinternational community to mobilize on a large scale toensure the success of the forthcoming meting of smallisland developing States  to be convened on the islandof Mauritius early in 2005.I must not fail to affirm before the Assembly thatmy country  the Union of the Comoros  in its concernto maintain its unity and integrity  considers the issueof the Comorian island of Mayotte to be one of itsgreatest and most urgent priorities. My Government isconvinced that a speedy settlement of this dispute willfurther the development of the country as a whole andwill enable it to resolutely take its place alongsidepeace- and freedom-loving countries and to championuniversal ideals and promote democracy in the world.The Union of the Comoros therefore calls on theFrench Republic to engage in a constructive politicaldialogue on this issue  in compliance with GeneralAssembly resolution 3385 (XXX)  which admitted theComoros to the United Nations as the ComoroArchipelago  composed of four islands: Mayotte Anjouan  Mohéli and Grande-Comore.In the same spirit  my country attaches the utmostimportance to the principle of a single independent andindivisible China and calls for the restoration of theisland of Taiwan to its rightful home.My country truly values the very constructivedialogue now under way between the Government ofthe Republic of India and the Islamic Republic ofPakistan on the question of Kashmir.The Union of the Comoros sincerely hopes thatthe Palestinian and Israeli peoples will soon institute adialogue that will bring about an end to the violenceand lead to the peaceful coexistence of those twoneighbouring peoples.It also hopes to see a just and equitable settlementto the question of Western Sahara and vigorouslysupports the efforts made to that end by the UnitedNations and the Government of the Kingdom ofMorocco.The Union of the Comoros vehemently condemnsthe hostage-takings in Iraq and hopes to see a rapidreturn of peace and security in Iraq  which willcontribute to security in the region.The Union of the Comoros is closely followingdevelopments in Darfur. It supports the efforts of theAfrican Union  the Government of the Sudan and theentire international community to find a speedy  justand equitable settlement of that question.Finally  I hope that the work of the fifty-ninthsession of the General Assembly will be successful and I join all those eminent personalities who havepreceded me at this noble rostrum in expressing mycountry’s most fervent desires for greater peace andsecurity throughout the world."
"40",1618,"CPV",59,2004,"I should like at the outset Mr. President  to hail your election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I wouldalso like to extend to you our best wishes for success incarrying out your mandate  a mandate which reflectsthe honour bestowed on your country  the Republic ofGabon  by the international community.I would also like to take this opportunity to paytribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan  for his selfless commitment to the causesof the United Nations and of Africa in particular.I believe this is also an appropriate time to paytribute to and commend the actions of the formerPresident of the General Assembly  Mr. Julian Hunte for his considerable contribution to promoting theuniversality of the United Nations.My country  the Republic of Cape Verde  isamong the small island States. We believe that ourStates  as a result of their specific characteristics deserve a special hearing from the internationalcommunity. In the economic  social and ecologicalspheres  those States are confronting shortcomings andrestrictions specific to them  and these must be dulytaken into account.Through its own efforts  but also through thenecessary contribution of the international community Cape Verde is now preparing to better itself and itscondition as a least developed country (LDC). Mycountry continues to suffer from a precarious situationwhich cannot be ignored or minimized. In addition  thesmall island States often represent unique physical andhuman realities which form a genuine heritage ofmankind. For these and other reasons  I would like hereto launch an appeal in favour of the small island States.The international community is going through aparticularly complex period marked by challenges ofmany kinds. We are aware that it is only by focusing onpeace  stability  security  dialogue and respect fordiversity of interests and cultures  in an atmosphere offreedom  that we can create an internationalenvironment conducive to the just settlement of theserious problems we are encountering today.2War does not have to be inevitable. Moreover given the very advanced stage of civilization whichmankind has achieved  I think it would be relevant toask whether it is time to leave behind the conceptformulated by the outstanding nineteenth-centuryGerman military theoretician Clausewitz  who statedthat war is a continuation of policy through othermeans. I think  rather  that it is by relying onnegotiations  dialogue and the acknowledgement of thelegitimacy of the interests and rights of all parties  thatwe can tap the potential for avoiding the need for waras a means of resolving national or internationaldisputes.Finally  it is with respect for international law drawn up with the participation of all and equallyshared and respected by all — a respect whichpermeates the principles and purposes of the UnitedNations — that we can find a response leading to apeaceful  prosperous and just world: the world whichmankind clearly wishes to see.I would like to reiterate here and now ourabsolute rejection of the unwarranted use of violenceand our unequivocal condemnation of the use ofterrorism as a way of resolving political disputes. Thetrivialization of life and death  which is utterlycondemnable  also dehumanizes its proponents andopens the way to the worst kinds of wrongs in relationsbetween human communities. This is why the strugglefor peace cannot be halted  and why everyone especially the United Nations  has the imperative dutyto contribute to breaking the cycle of violence andopening the way to peaceful coexistence among nationsand human communities.Among the other social ills afflicting our planetwhich can be effectively combated are hunger andpoverty. Their eradication is in fact one of theobjectives of the Millennium agenda. I am convincedthat success in combating hunger and poverty will haveunquestionably positive global effects that wouldpromote unity and harmony within the human family and would strengthen human rights  including the mostsacred and vital right — the right to life. It would alsopromote the material and moral enrichment of all ofhuman society. It would contribute to the creation ofconditions that are a prerequisite for improvinginternational security by lessening migration andbridging the gap between rich and poor  thuseliminating the reasons for the frustration of millionsof poor and hungry individuals throughout today’sworld.Another tragedy that requires action is HIV/AIDS  which is mortgaging the future of manycountries  particularly in Africa. There is an urgentneed to advance and guarantee effective internationalsolidarity in order to root out from the daily lives ofmillions of human beings the spectre of hunger poverty and pandemic illnesses. It is my belief thatmankind has the resources and potential which willallow us to realize this marvellous dream.The African continent  of which my country andyour country  Mr. President  are a part  continue to befaced with enormous and varied challenges. Regardingthe critical issue of peace and political stability  wealso note a genuine commitment on the part of AfricanStates to resolve conflicts and eliminate hotbeds oftension. But the political will of States  regionalorganizations and the African Union is not enough  andthe international community’s commitment and itsindispensable contribution in the form of adequateresources are necessary for peace and security tobecome a reality for all our peoples within a reasonableperiod of time.Peace is not merely the absence of war. Genuinepeace requires sufficient time and confidence-buildingamong parties  as well as a strategy for building peace.So too  peace and stability within States requireinstitutions and policies that are inclusive and thatrespect and engage all sectors of nations and meet theirlegitimate political and economic aspirations  while atthe same time ensuring the protection of their culturalidentity.There can be no doubt that  owing to profoundchanges in the scientific  technological and socio-political fields  a huge movement of democratization ofhuman societies is under way  backed by theinstitutions of the rule of law. However  mere politicaldemocracy is not sufficient. The ordinary citizen mustbe guaranteed participation in public affairs and adecent  worthy and dignified life  since there can be nofreedom without dignity.It must also be recognized that there are stilltenuous vestiges of the old orders  which must onceand for all be rooted out and eliminated fromrelationships between individuals and communities such as racism  religious and cultural discrimination 3gender inequality  and scorn for the fundamental rightsof indigenous human communities in various countries.We must also ask whether democracy withinStates is reflected in relations among States particularly when we note the existence of animbalanced world in which the inequality of powerbetween the haves and the have nots continues to growday by day. Therefore  there is a critical need topromote the democratization of international relationsby seeking better balance in relations among States.International democracy based on dialogue andcooperation among States and among cultures  ontolerance and respect for cultural diversity amongcommunities and on human solidarity and respect forthe legitimate political and material interests of allparties  of nations large and small would show itself inthe implementation of genuine multilateralism inglobal governance. Herein undoubtedly lie thefoundations for triumph over today’s challenges andthe assurance of a safe  peaceful  predictable andprosperous future for humanity.In several months  the United Nations will mark60 years of rich and intense life that has been filledwith challenges  upheavals and extremely complexproblems  but that has also been marked byinnumerable victories and hopes for humanity. Mycountry joined the community of nations in large partbecause of the intervention of the United Nations topromote the freedom and human rights of colonialpeoples  for which we shall always be grateful. Ibelieve that  in the light of the profound changes thathave occurred over the past six decades in all areas ofthe international arena and the emergence of a newbalance of forces and extremely complex challengesrequiring urgent and immediate responses  it isbecoming clear that we need to move forward withreform of the United Nations  particularly the SecurityCouncil. In my view  the planned reform should  inaddition to reflecting new global geopolitical realities guarantee representativity and appropriate interventionand participation for all continents and allcommunities. From that perspective  we would thenhave a more balanced international community and amore equitable sharing of responsibility in the buildingof humanity’s future.Before concluding  I should like to highlight thesuccessful actions carried out in the past few years bythe United Nations under the leadership of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who has enabledus to keep on the international agenda substantiveissues that confront many societies daily  which hasenabled this universal institution to be in direct contactwith concerns and challenges that are worrisome to allmembers of the human family.Here  I should also like to honour the memory ofall those who have served the United Nations andfallen victim to senseless acts resulting fromintolerance and the terrorism of radical movements. Iemphasize the need for all countries and all formal andinformal institutions to guarantee and respect thesecurity of such noble men and women  for they are ona mission to serve all of us.I hope  Sir  that this fifty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly  which is taking place under yourpresidency  will provide new gains for peace  justice social progress and global stability.Finally  I should like to reiterate the words ofPope John Paul II  the unquestionable moral authorityof our time  in his appeal to world leaders on 1 Januarythis year:“The United Nations ... needs to rise more andmore above the cold status of an administrativeinstitution and to become a moral centre whereall the nations of the world feel at home ...”"
"41",1664,"CRI",59,2004,"On behalf of the Government and the peopleof Costa Rica  may I convey to you  Mr. President  ourwarmest congratulations and best wishes on yourassumption of the important post of President.The nineteenth century was  for vast sectors ofmankind  the century of freedom. However  in manyregions of the world  there were and continue to be unacceptable levels of repression. The twentiethcentury was  for a good number of nations  the centuryof economic development. Nonetheless  the end of thetwentieth century witnessed a prevalence of poverty oppressive hunger and injustice  that have conspiredtogether against aspirations for peace  security andjustice.The twenty-first century should be devoted tomaking freedom universal and consolidating economicdevelopment  but above all  to creating an opportunityfor social justice  international cooperation  equitablerelations among nations and the eradication of poverty.Since the beginning of my administration and inkeeping with that idea  I have advocated aglobalization that is tempered by justice and focusedon fulfilling the basic needs of all human beings andtheir right to happiness.At my inauguration in May 2002  I noted that justa few years earlier  when I began to speak of the needto globalize justice and to humanize globalization some skeptics considered me a lonely voice crying outin a desert of fierce competition. Today we are manymore and our voice is much more powerful indemanding that the process of globalization be mademore humane.I am therefore very encouraged today by the factthat world opinion shares the same concerns which arereflected in the recommendations of the ILO reportentitled “A fair globalization: Creating opportunitiesfor all”. That report correctly states: “We believe thedominant perspective on globalization must shift morefrom a narrow preoccupation with markets to a broaderpreoccupation with people.” (Preface  p. vii)As greater integration develops between peoplesand economies  it is urgent that we incorporateelements of a humanistic ethic into the globalizationprocess  as an opportunity to spread the benefits ofeconomic development and scientific and technologicalprogress. These significant developments  the productof human wisdom and intelligence  are and must beenjoyed by all as part of the patrimony of all mankind.Today  this Organization unites 191 States withdifferent identities and diverse histories  but withfutures and presents that grow more interdependentwith every passing day. In international forums  it hasbecome commonplace to speak of the need toformulate inclusive national models of development. Ibelieve that it is high time to speak of an inclusiveglobal society. This General Assembly  whichrepresents and expresses the common will of all25mankind  must play a central role in promoting amarkedly humane globalization.Economic development is a force that must bedirected and guided. The economy’s positive andpowerful forces should not be left to the invisible handdetermined  in most cases  by the obvious inequalityamong nations. In that regard  it is necessary toconsider some concerning data regarding the globaleconomy. The rate of growth of the global grossdomestic product decreased progressively from anaverage of 3.6 per cent in the 1960s to an average of a1.1 per cent in the 1990s. If we compare the per capitagross domestic products in constant dollars of the 20poorest countries and the 20 richest  we note that between 1960 and 1962  the former were almost 54times poorer than the latter  while four decades later  inthe period 2000-2002  they were 121 times poorer. Thedifferences have been accentuated and the gap hasbroadened. These results show an inverse relationshipto what we should be looking for if we really seek apeaceful  stable and fair world.In light of those realities  and in order to enablethe 1.2 billion poorest people in the world toparticipate in the benefits of economic development we must promote policies and strategies that createopportunities for all. To that end  it is necessary tomake progress at the international level in thefollowing two directions. First  we must agree on andstrengthen rules and policies that provide a fairnormative framework for globalization. Secondly  weshould create or broaden the venues for the effectiveinternational negotiation  management andimplementation of those agreements.Poverty  the lack of opportunities  deficientmedical services and limited access to education frequently accompanied by excessive expenditure inarmaments  cause the suffering of most peoples. It isnoteworthy that  in 2003  the world set a new record bydevoting $956 billion to military expenditure. Thatrepresents a 17-fold increase in the amount ofresources devoted worldwide to official developmentassistance and more than the sum of the foreign debt ofthe 64 countries with the lowest gross domesticproduct. Those numbers demonstrate that mankind hasyet to understand that security results not frommultiplying weapons  but from multiplying loaves ofbread. Peace and security are built  above all  bycombating injustice  satisfying basic needs  striving forcommon social goals and establishing fair and honestGovernment.As pointedly noted by Mr. Oscar Arias Sánchez former President of Costa Rica and Nobel Peace Prizelaureate “the billions of dollars spent every year onweapons and on military contingents deprive theworld’s poorest peoples of the chance to fulfiltheir basic needs”.In that regard  Costa Rica fully supports the draftframework convention on international arms transfers.That project  based on the obligations alreadyundertaken by States  seeks to regulate the export ofweapons and their marking and tracing in order toprevent arms transfers to terrorist and rebel groups andto those States that breach international humanitarianlaw or basic human rights principles. I respectfullyurge all United Nations Member States to adopt thatinstrument of international law. I am convinced that itwill contribute substantially to our struggle against theillicit traffic of weapons around the world.The aphorism that “the security of one isinseparable from the security of all” is growing truerevery day. Global democratic governance requiresstrengthening both the United Nations and thecompetences of the General Assembly. Every StateMember must have a voice and every people of theworld must be represented  in conformity with theprinciples of equality and universality that govern theUnited Nations system. The Security Council must bereformed by enlarging its membership and making itmore democratic.The maintenance of prerogatives for some States to the detriment of the great majority of StatesMembers  is not only antidemocratic  but contrary tothe principle of sovereign equality among Statesenshrined in the San Francisco Charter itself.Committed to the principles of universality anddemocracy on which the United Nations is based  Irenew Costa Rica’s longstanding call for the admissionto the United Nations  in conditions of full legalequality  of the Republic of China on Taiwan  whoseGovernment has often reiterated its willingness toassume the obligations imposed by the Charter.Allow me to refer to one of the worst scourgesaffecting peaceful relations among the nations: thethreat of terrorism. The grave attacks committed all26over the world over the past few years — in particular those committed in New York  Madrid andBeslan — prove how far terrorists are prepared to go.Costa Rica is fervently committed to the culture of lifeand  in consequence  our people and Governmentcondemn all acts of terrorism.Even the loftiest ideals from the most legitimatesources become mere excuses and pretexts when theyare taken over by terrorists. The first victims of theterrorists are the causes that they claim to defend.International society must firmly and resolutelyconfront all acts of terrorism  the painful and deadlyconsequences of which touch so many nations andinnocent victims. It is essential to combat all forms ofterrorism as well as its sources of financing and safehavens. It is equally essential to combat with the sameresolve the poverty  inequality and hunger — both forfood and for justice — that afflict many peoples.The coordination of the international struggleagainst terrorism must be assigned to an independent professional and permanent organ located at the centreof this Organization. For that reason  we propose thecreation of the post of United Nations highcommissioner on terrorism that would assist theSecurity Council  the General Assembly and theEconomic and Social Council in the comprehensivefight against that threat and its causes. Only bycreating such an organ  which would draw togetherresources and multiply efforts  will it be possible torespond adequately and jointly to the challenge posedby international terrorism.Today  global democratic governance has twofundamental pillars: the International Court of Justiceand the International Criminal Court. The InternationalCourt of Justice  whose obligatory jurisdiction CostaRica accepts without reservation  provides us with animpartial instance for the peaceful solution ofcontroversies within the framework of the rule of law thus avoiding haphazard or arbitrary interpretations ofthe legal norms.Nevertheless  we note with concern that very fewStates accept the obligatory jurisdiction of the Courtwithout conditions. Most States have made reservationsthat exclude  in some cases  all the possible or even allthe conceivable situations in which they would have tosubmit to the authority of the principal judicial organof the United Nations.The International Criminal Court  whoseestablishment Costa Rica supported enthusiastically provides us with an impartial organ to judge the mostserious crimes against mankind. Ironically  while weall repudiate those crimes  only 94 States have ratifiedthe Rome Statute and accepted the competence of theCourt.I would also like to refer to the need to globalizecriminal justice in order to prosecute those who  takingadvantage of public office  rob their own peoples. Howmany generations will be condemned to pay the odiousdebts created by leaders irremediably sick of greed?We must never forget that corruption is the mother ofpoverty because it deprives the poorest peoples of theworld of the resources necessary to finance theireducation  health  housing and social security.Mr. Verbeke (Belgium)  Vice-President  took theChair.It is time to give justice its rightful place. Thereshould be no loopholes. Asylum and protection shouldnot be given to those who ransack their own peoples.All safe havens of impunity must disappear.As we have a duty to protect the oppressed andpersecuted  we also have a duty to protect those whodo not yet have a voice. In particular  there is apressing need to agree on a normative framework internationally binding  to uphold human dignity fromthe moment of conception. It necessarily follows therefore  that to defend life is to defend the veryessence of man itself  all the promises  joys and hopesof the human being.I believe in science within ethical limits. As amedical doctor  I reject human cloning  while I firmlysupport research on adult stem cells  which does notpresent the same ethical and legal problems as doescloning. I invite you all to join us in our efforts toadopt an international convention to ban all forms ofhuman cloning.We owe a great debt to nature. It is time to ensurethat globalization be sustainable from an ecologicalpoint of view  in order to maintain the viability ofhuman life on planet Earth. Notwithstanding thecommitment of 120 nations  we have been unable toobtain the necessary support for the entry into force ofthe Kyoto Protocol.In 2001  the High-Level Panel on Financing forDevelopment proposed that the various international27entities on environment be consolidated into a singleorganization with a standing similar to that of theWorld Trade Organization or the InternationalMonetary Fund. Regrettably  this proposal  as well assimilar initiatives  has not yet enjoyed the necessaryconsensus for its approval. Undoubtedly  somethingmust be done soon in this regard.We live in a globalized world. This is the logicaloutcome of the natural evolution of things and theprogress of mankind  especially in the areas oftelecommunication and information technology. Thisfact has brought nations closely together and  at thesame time  it has created unavoidable multilateralresponsibilities.Today  we live in a world that tries to follow notonly the rules of the global market but also democraticprinciples  one that tries to uphold higher standardsregarding the observance of human rights  whilerejecting all forms of odious discrimination andshowing concern for the environment. The observanceof these minimum standards  adopted by theinternational society itself  should be the rule formeasuring each State.Costa Rica would like to see the followingprinciples recognized and practised by the wholeinternational community: greater respect for humanrights and labour guarantees  greater protection for theenvironment and greater social investment in exchangefor less military expenditure. States should havegreater opportunities to access internationalcooperation  credit and markets  while prices should befair  reflecting real costs. It is not fair that poorcountries  such as Costa Rica  which are making effortsin the areas of disarmament  respect for humanrights  labour justice  protection of the environment and greater social investment  be penalized byexcluding them from the lists of beneficiaries ofcooperation programmes and from systems ofpreferential treatment for the access of their productsto the markets of developed countries.If we desire lasting peace and a secure world  weshould give a humane dimension to relations amongthe various nations. Let us undertake together thechallenge to overcome poverty  hunger  malnutritionand injustice  as we committed ourselves to do justyesterday  in the meeting convened by the President ofBrazil  His Excellency Mr. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.Let us make this task the centre of the internationalagenda for the short term. A better world is possible. Itis in our hands to build it."
"42",1733,"CUB",59,2004,"Every year at the United Nations  we go through thesame ritual. We attend the general debate knowingbeforehand that the clamour for justice and peace byour underdeveloped countries will be ignored onceagain. However  we persist. We know that we are right.We know that one day we will accomplish socialjustice and development. We also know that such assetswill not be given away to us. We know that the peopleswill have to seize them from those who deny us justicetoday  because they underpin their wealth andarrogance with disdain for our grief. It will not bealways like that  however. We say so today with moreconviction than ever before.Having said this  and knowing as we do that somepowerful ones — just a few — present here will bechagrined  and also knowing that they are shared bymany  Cuba will now tell some truths.First  after the aggression on Iraq  there is noUnited Nations  understood as a useful and diverseforum based on respect for the rights of all and withguarantees for the small States. It is experiencing theworst moment of its nearly 60 years. It languishes  itgasps for air  it keeps up appearances  but it does notwork. Who handcuffed the United Nations  named byPresident Roosevelt? President Bush.Second  United States troops will have to bewithdrawn from Iraq. Now that the lives of over 1 000American youths have been uselessly sacrificed toserve the spurious interests of a clique of cronies andbuddies  and following the deaths of more than 12 000Iraqis  it is clear that the only way out for the occupierfaced with a people in revolt is to recognize theimpossibility of subduing them and to withdraw. Inspite of the imperial monopoly over information peoples always get to the truth. Someday  thoseresponsible and their accomplices will have to dealwith the consequences of their actions in the face ofhistory and their own peoples.Third  for the time being  there will be no valid real and useful reform of the United Nations. It wouldtake the super-Power  which inherited the immenseprerogative of governing an order conceived for abipolar world  to relinquish its privileges. And it willnot do so.33As of now  we know that the anachronisticprivilege of the veto will remain; that the SecurityCouncil will not be democratized as it should be orexpanded to include third world countries; that theGeneral Assembly will continue to stand ignored; andthat  at the United Nations  there will be more actionsdriven by the interests imposed by the super-Power andits allies. We  as non-aligned countries  will have toentrench ourselves in defending the United NationsCharter  because if we do not it will be redrafted withthe deletion of every trace of such principles as thesovereign equality of States  non-intervention and thenon-use or the threat of use of force.Fourth  the powerful collude to divide us. The130-plus underdeveloped countries must build acommon front for the defence of the sacred interests ofour peoples and of our right to development and peace.Let us revitalize the Non-Aligned Movement. Let usstrengthen the Group of 77.Fifth  the modest objectives of the MillenniumDeclaration will not be accomplished. We will reachthe fifth anniversary of the Summit in a situation thathas worsened. We sought to halve by 2015 the 1.276billion human beings in abject poverty that existed in1990. There would have to be a yearly reduction ofmore than 46 million poor people. However  excludingChina  between 1990 and 2000  extreme poverty roseby 28 million people. Poverty does not decline  itgrows.We wanted to reduce by half by 2015 the 842million hungry people in the world. There would havehad to be a yearly reduction of 28 million. However there has been a reduction of barely 2.1 million hungrypeople per year. At this rate  the goal will be attainedby 2215  two hundred years after what was envisaged and only if our species survives the destruction of itsenvironment.We proclaimed the aspiration to achieve universalprimary education by 2015. However  more than 120million children — or 1 in every 5 children of schoolage — do not attend primary school. According to theUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  at thecurrent rate  the goal will be achieved after 2100.We also proposed to reduce by two thirds themortality rate in children under the age of five. Thereduction has been symbolic: whereas 86 children diedper 1 000 live births in 1998  the figure is now 82.Every year  11 million children continue to die ofdiseases that can be prevented or cured  and theirparents rightfully wonder what our meetings are for.We said that we would pay attention to Africa’sspecial needs. However  very little has been done.African nations do not need foreign advice or models but rather financial resources and access to marketsand technologies. Assisting Africa would not be an actof charity  but an act of justice  a settling of the historicdebt resulting from centuries of exploitation andpillage.We committed ourselves to halting and starting toreverse the AIDS epidemic by 2015. However  in 2003 it claimed nearly 3 million lives. At this rate  some 36million people will have died of this disease by 2015.Sixth  creditor countries and the internationalfinancial agencies will not seek a just and lastingsolution to foreign debt. They prefer to keep us indebt — in other words  vulnerable. Therefore  eventhough we have paid off $4.1 trillion in debt servicingover the last 13 years  our debt has increased from $1.4trillion to $2.6 trillion. This means that we have paidthree times what we owed and now our debt is twice aslarge.Seventh  we  the underdeveloped countries  arethe ones that finance the wastefulness and the opulenceof developed countries. While in 2003 they gave us$68.4 billion in official development assistance (ODA) we delivered $436 billion to them as payment for theforeign debt. Who is helping whom?Eighth  the fight against terrorism can only bewon through cooperation among all nations  withrespect for international law  and not through massivebombings or pre-emptive wars against dark corners ofthe world. We must put an end to hypocrisy and doublestandards. Sheltering three Cuban-born terrorists in theUnited States is an act complicit with terrorism.Punishing five young Cuban antiterrorists  togetherwith their families  is a crime.Ninth  general and complete disarmament including nuclear disarmament  is impossible today. Itis the responsibility of a group of developed countriesthat are the ones that sell and buy the most weapons.However  we must continue to strive for this goal. Wemust demand that the over $900 billion set aside everyyear for military expenditures be used fordevelopment.34Tenth  the financial resources to guarantee thesustainable development of all peoples on the planetare available  but what is lacking is the political will ofthose who rule the world. A development tax of merely0.1 per cent on international financial transactionswould generate resources amounting to almost $400billion a year. The cancellation of the foreign debtincurred by underdeveloped countries would allowthem to have no less than $436 billion a year availablefor their development  money which is currently usedto pay off the constantly-rising debt. If developedcountries complied with their commitment to set aside0.7 per cent of their gross national product as ODA and not 0.2 per cent as they currently do  theircontribution would increase from the current $68.4billion to $160 billion a year.Lastly  I want to clearly express Cuba’s profoundconviction that the 6.4 billion human beings on thisplanet — who have equal rights according to theUnited Nations Charter — urgently require a new orderin which the world is not in suspense  as is the casenow  awaiting the outcome of the elections in a newRome  in which only half the voters will participateand nearly $1.5 billion will be spent.There is no discouragement in our words; I mustmake that clear. We are optimistic  because we arerevolutionaries. We have faith in the struggle of thepeoples  and we are sure that we will achieve a newworld order based on respect for the rights of all — anorder based on solidarity  justice and peace  resultingfrom the best of universal culture  not from mediocrityor brute force.With regard to Cuba — and neither blockades threats  hurricanes  droughts  nor human or naturalforce can divert it from its course — I shall saynothing. On 28 October  for the thirteenth time  theGeneral Assembly will discuss and vote on a draftresolution on the blockade against the Cuban people.Once again  morality and principles will defeatarrogance and force.I conclude by recalling the words spoken here 25years ago by President Fidel Castro:“The clashing of weapons  the threateninglanguage and the overbearing behaviour in theinternational arena must cease. Enough of theillusion that the problems of the world can besolved by nuclear weapons. Bombs may kill thehungry  the sick and the ignorant; but bombscannot kill hunger  disease and ignorance. Norcan bombs kill the righteous rebellion of thepeoples.” "
"43",1779,"CYP",59,2004,"I wish  Sir  to expressto you my most sincere congratulations on yourelection as President of this session of the GeneralAssembly and to wish you every success in steering thework of this body. I would also like to extend ourthanks and appreciation to the President of the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly  especially forhis inspired efforts to promote so vigorously theagenda of United Nations reform and the revitalizationof the General Assembly.As this is the last session of the General Assemblybefore the 2005 major event  we must proceed to evaluatethe prospects for attaining the ambitious targets we setat the turn of the millennium. The major event will bethe first real assessment of our progress towards theimplementation of the Millennium Declaration  of theoutcomes of major world conferences and of initiativessuch as the action launched by the Presidents of Brazil France and Chile and the Prime Minister of Spain toeradicate poverty and hunger  and the initiative of thePresidents of Finland and Tanzania on the socialdimensions of globalization.Specifically with regard to the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  we believe that the ability to makedevelopment on the ground an issue of global concernas a result of those pledges will be a measure of theability of the United Nations to induce significantchange and advances where they are most needed.The Republic of Cyprus supports thestrengthening of the United Nations system through thereform process that is under way and looks forward tothe report of the High-Level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change and the recommendations ofthe Secretary-General. We attach particular importanceto the revitalization of the General Assembly and to thereform of the Security Council so that its structure willreflect contemporary political realities and a morebalanced geographical representation. In the spirit ofthose two principles  and with the aim of reinforcingthe legitimacy and efficacy of the Council  Cyprus issupportive of increasing both the permanent and thenon-permanent membership. In that respect  we believethat the joint French and German position on theenlargement of the Council could provide a basis forachieving the aforementioned objectives.We share the assessment of the Secretary-Generalthat consolidating effective multilateralism in a flexibleand versatile United Nations is the best way to addressthe complete spectrum of global crises and ensure thatpreventive mechanisms exist to avert such crises. Suchconsolidation applies also to security deficits andparticularly terrorism  whose underlying causes wehave been unable to eliminate despite our concertedefforts. We consider that the conclusion of a5comprehensive United Nations convention againstterrorism is important in order to address moreresolutely  within the framework of internationallegality  the threat posed by terrorism.Addressing other deficiencies in the internationalsystem — particularly those that give rise to crisissituations and to humanitarian disasters — should alsobe considered a matter of both urgency and priority.One such crisis is Darfur  which  following manyothers like it  keeps Africa at the heart of our concerns.It demonstrates not only why we should focus themajority of our humanitarian resources andpeacekeeping efforts on Africa  but also why we shouldundertake every possible effort to make sustainabledevelopment a global reality.The Middle East is another region that remainsvolatile  despite growing global concern and despitemany attempts to restore the peace process in theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. We deem to be necessarymore active involvement by the Quartet in the effortsto implement the road map and put an end to the cycleof violence. More emphasis should also be placed onthe task of improving living conditions in order tonormalize people’s lives to the greatest possible extent.Our support remains focused on ending the occupation achieving a just and viable settlement based on UnitedNations resolutions  and the realization of thePalestinian people’s aspirations for the establishmentof an independent State  living side by side with Israelin conditions of sustainable peace and security.The aspirations of humanity revolve around theachievement of full respect for human rights democracy and the rule of law. The collective visionand effort required to fulfil that massive endeavourdemands the contribution of all  to the extent of theircapabilities. Cyprus is prepared to play its part from itsvantage point in the European Union  while drawingupon its traditional participation in forums dedicated topromoting agendas pertaining to those values. Thataffiliation has been a source of support for us sinceCyprus’s independence  and its impact not only makesus grateful but also has endowed us with sensitivitiesthat will continue to be an integral part of ourapproach.I would like to emphasize how proud we are thatCyprus is now a member of the European Union. TheUnion has outlined an extensive set of priorities forthis session of the General Assembly. As the statementdelivered Tuesday by the Dutch presidency hasdelineated those priorities  I will not elaborate on themany further.This year marks 30 years since the occupation of37 per cent of Cyprus’s territory as a result of theinvasion of the island by Turkish troops. It also marks30 years of relentless efforts by the Greek Cypriots toachieve a just and peaceful settlement  with the supportof the international community  for which I would herelike to express our deep appreciation.The Secretary-General’s most recent effort tosolve the Cyprus problem resulted in a plan that wasdescribed by some as a historic opportunity to solveone of the most long-standing international problems. Iwill outline only briefly why  despite the hard workinvested in the process by everyone involved  the endproduct of that effort was judged to have beeninadequate and to have fallen short of minimumexpectations for a settlement for Greek Cypriots.First  the Annan Plan was not the product ofnegotiation  nor did it constitute an agreed solutionbetween the parties. Secondly  the Plan did not placethe necessary emphasis on achieving a one-Statesolution with a central Government able to guaranteethe single  sovereign character of Cyprus. Thirdly  itfailed to address the serious concerns of the GreekCypriot community regarding their security and theeffective implementation of the Plan.In rejecting the Plan as a settlement for theCyprus problem  the Greek Cypriots did not reject thesolution or the reunification of their country; theyrejected this particular Plan as not effectivelyachieving that objective. We remain committed to asolution that will ensure the reunification of ourcountry  its economy and its people.We are committed to reaching a solution on thebasis of a bizonal  bicommunal federation. There are however  a number of essential parameters on whichthe Greek Cypriot community insists such a solutionmust be founded: the withdrawal of Turkish troops andsettlers and respect for the human rights of allCypriots  the underlying structures for a functioningeconomy  the functionality and workability of the newstate of affairs  the just resolution of land and propertyissues in accordance with the decisions of theEuropean Court of Human Rights  and respect for theright of return of refugees. To that end  we welcomethe recent Pinheiro progress report on the restitution of6property in the context of the return of refugees andinternally displaced persons. Simultaneously  it distressesme to bring to the attention of the Assembly thatcertain provisions of the Annan Plan have encouragedthe unprecedented unlawful exploitation of propertiesin occupied Cyprus that belong to Greek Cypriots.The most paramount feature of any settlement isthe ability to instil a sense of security among thepeople. In that regard  the mistakes of the past must notbe repeated. Cyprus must  in its future course  proceedwithout any grey areas with regard to its sovereignty orits relations with third-party States. If the people feel thattheir needs have not formed the basis of any solution thathas been reached or that the characteristics of thatsolution have been dictated by the interests of thirdparties  then that solution will  unsurprisingly  berejected. Indeed  in spirit and in practice  effectivemultilateralism not only encompasses but also derivesfrom the comprehension and consideration of localrealities and particulars  on which it must then proceedto formulate proposals.In the framework of the European Union  andwith the aim of promoting reunification andreconciliation  my Government — despite the obstaclescreated by the current status quo — is consistentlypursuing policies aimed at enhancing the economicdevelopment of the Turkish Cypriots. We believe thatsuch policies  while not intended to serve as asubstitute for a solution  are the most effective way tofoster maximum economic integration of the twocommunities and to increase contact between them  soas to ensure the viability of a future solution.The Cyprus problem is not always perceived inits correct context. The fact remains that this problemis the result of a military invasion and of the continuedoccupation of part of the territory of a sovereign State.That fact should not be conveniently overlooked byconcentrating on peripheral matters. Any initiative tosolve the problem must have at its core that most basicand fundamental fact and must be based on the premisethat international legality must be served and theoccupation ended.Unfortunately  the fundamentals of the situationon the ground have remained unchanged for the past 30years  since the Turkish invasion in Cyprus. Thatsituation comprises severe violations of the mostfundamental human rights. The still-unresolved issue ofmissing persons — an issue of a purely humanitariannature — and that of the enclaved of the Karpasspeninsula are in themselves an indication of theenduring suffering of Cyprus. That not only shouldpoint us towards the specifics of the solution to bepursued  but also must guide our actions with regard tomanaging the status quo. For instance  the UnitedNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) assigned the task of managing the status quo inflicted30 years ago  should remain specific to the situation onthe ground.The accession of Cyprus to the European Union in conjunction with the lack of an agreement aimed atsettling the Cyprus problem — despite our efforts andour preference for a settlement prior to accession —signifies the end of one era and the beginning of a newone.I firmly believe that the new context defined bythe accession of my country to the European Union andby the expressed will of Turkey to advance on theEuropean path offers a unique opportunity and couldhave a catalytic effect in reaching a settlement inCyprus. Our vocation is to be partners  not enemies.Hence  in this new era  we call upon Turkey to joinus in turning the page and in seeking ways to discovermutually beneficial solutions to the various aspects thatcompose the Cyprus problem. The mere realization thatpeace and stability in our region serve the interests ofboth our countries is ample evidence to prove that whatunites us is stronger than what divides us."
"44",1803,"CZE",59,2004,"Let me firstcongratulate Mr. Jean Ping on his election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session andwish him every success in this important position. Iwould also like to thank his predecessor  Mr. JulianHunte  for his relentless efforts and leadershipthroughout the year.In May  the Czech Republic became a member ofthe European Union (EU). For the first time  we tookpart in the preparation of the EU statement presentedhere last week by the Foreign Minister of theNetherlands  as well as in shaping the EU priorities forthe current General Assembly session. It goes withoutsaying that we fully associate ourselves with thosetexts.We share the commitment of the EU to effectivemultilateralism  with the United Nations at its core.Indeed  the vision of a strong and truly universalUnited Nations is one of the fundamentals of Czechforeign policy.Security  or the lack of it  has emerged as themost challenging problem today. Internationalterrorism  the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  regional conflicts  State failure ororganized crime — these are the threats menacing allof us.Terrorism spares no one anywhere in the world.The brutality of the attacks and the increase in theirnumber over the past year are frightening. It seems thatthe whole nature of terrorism is changing. While mostearlier terrorists tried to target specific persons orinstitutions  with the aim of gaining the sympathy ofthe general public  today’s terrorists are solely intenton spreading fear and terror. Their target is the generalpublic  each one of us  and the more killed the better.What can we expect of individuals who sacrificeunlimited numbers of their own people to a perverseideology? Their acquisition of weapons of massdestruction would result in a deadly combination.Absolute disregard for life by these “new”terrorists has also given rise to their most dangeroustool  the ideological suicide bomber. Previously terrorists had to devote most of their energy toplanning escape routes and concealing themselves; asuicide bomber  on the other hand  needs only toconcentrate on how best to hit and to destroy his target.The diffusion of targets and the perpetrators’absolute resolve mean that terrorist threats havecompletely permeated our public and private spaces each area of which has become a defence site. All thiscould ultimately lead to very disagreeable restrictionson certain freedoms and rights. And this takes us fullcircle.If we are lax in understanding our roots andvalues  and if we do not have a comprehensive grasp ofhuman rights  we could find that  in the end  we areunable to cope with the uneasy balance betweensecurity and freedom.I do not want to speculate about cause and effect.It is not the case that a terrorist attack is a reaction  aninappropriate reaction  to something. Terrorists’ideology is aggressive and expansive  and they do notrecognize terms such as “conciliation” or“coexistence”. Therefore  each offer we make tonegotiate  each sign of unwillingness to defendourselves  is seen by them as further proof of ourweakness and  by extension  of their “right” to assumecontrol of declining society.In the fight against terrorism  nobody can remainneutral. The United Nations has to pave the way forthis fight at the global level. To be sure  the Counter-Terrorism Committee has done an outstanding job inoverseeing the implementation of Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001) and in facilitating universalacceptance of the United Nations Conventions onterrorism; but certainly more can and should be done.The true tests of our ability to cooperate are Iraq Afghanistan and the Middle East.Iraq continues to be of utmost concern to theinternational community. The full transfer of power tothe Iraqi Interim Government is a historic moment forthe country and an essential step on the road towards afree  prosperous and secure country. The road will  nodoubt  be long and winding. Without the elimination ofterrorist activities and the stabilization of the securitysituation  political transition and economic recoverywill remain elusive.5Last summer  United Nations employees in Iraqpaid the highest price for their commitment to helpthose in need. Now  the Organization has new tasksbefore it  including those connected with preparationsfor free elections in January 2005. However  a greaterengagement of the United Nations requires a moresecure environment and stronger support from theinternational community. The Czech Republic’scontribution is focused mainly on building up Iraqisecurity forces and helping to finance the protection ofthe United Nations presence in Iraq.Iraq  however  must not divert our attention fromother major security concerns  including Afghanistan the Middle East  Africa and the Balkans. In all theseconflicts  my country seeks to play a constructive role contributing in various ways to the related efforts ofthe international community. Thus  in Afghanistan  theCzech Republic is participating in the stabilizationprocess and the rooting out of terrorism; in Africa  it istaking part in peacekeeping operations; in Kosovo  wehave our largest military contingent abroad serving inthe Kosovo Force and we intend to contribute troops tothe new EU-led mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.As for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  we believethat the role of the international community lies inproviding a trusted frame of reference. It is crucial thatboth parties to the conflict make a sincere effort toimplement their obligations in order to achieve thevision of two States living side by side in peace andsecurity and in a peaceful and secure neighbourhood.Last but not least  Africa has to remain on ouragenda. Ten years after the genocide in Rwanda another part of Africa is suffering from grave ethnicviolence. In Darfur  people are dying every day  and inthe Great Lakes region the situation is not much better.The international community must not turn away fromthose tragedies.So far I have focused mainly on what we callhard threats to international security. But I do not wantto create an impression that other problems plaguingthe contemporary world are of lesser importance.Those more traditional problems  or soft threats  alsocontinue to deserve our undiminished attention. Thereis no question of these two threats competing for ourresponse; there is no question of forgetting one infavour of the other.That is why the Czech Republic  as an emergingdonor country  supports the strengthening ofmultilateral development assistance within the UnitedNations system  as well as close cooperation among theUnited Nations funds and programmes and the BrettonWoods institutions. That is why we support and striveto contribute to activities undertaken in pursuit of theMillennium Development Goals and otherinternationally agreed development targets.Respect for human rights and fundamentalfreedoms remains a priority of Czech foreign policy.Together with the rest of the EU  we place specialemphasis on the abolition of the death penalty  the fightagainst torture — in fact  just a few days ago we signedthe Optional Protocol to the Convention againstTorture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or DegradingTreatment or Punishment — the protection of childrenin armed conflicts and  of course  respect for theactivities of human rights defenders who unfortunately  continue to face difficult conditions in anumber of countries  such as Belarus  Myanmar andCuba  among others.Convinced that all people have equal rights anddignity  the Czech Republic is concerned about recentattempts to create a human being through cloning. Wetherefore concur with those calling for the swiftadoption of a legally binding instrument at theuniversal level regulating the cloning of human beings.Faced with the aforementioned challenges  theUnited Nations has to change. Of course  UnitedNations reform seems to be on everyone’s agenda.There are  perhaps  too many reform processes goingon in parallel or partially overlapping. To achievegenuine reform  however  we simply have to keep thepressure on; the United Nations must continueconstantly to monitor itself and to continue its pursuitof improvement.The Czech Republic considers itself a reform-minded country. It is an advocate of revitalization ofthe General Assembly  strengthening of the UnitedNations and reform and enlargement of the SecurityCouncil. For many years  we have been activelyinvolved in those processes  including through theCzech presidency of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly. We have no vested interest in thesereforms except the better functioning and greaterauthority of the whole United Nations. The CzechRepublic will continue to support inevitable reformmeasures  including enlargement of the SecurityCouncil in both categories of membership. In6particular  we support the aspiration of Germany andJapan to permanent seats  as well as the allocation of afurther three new permanent seats for Africa  Asia andLatin America.We greatly appreciate the reform efforts that theSecretary-General has made so far  and we expect hisguidance to continue in the years to come. We eagerlyawait the report of the High-Level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change  which should place UnitedNations reform in a wider context of major globalthreats and challenges.We are determined to play an active role infinding multilateral and United Nations-based solutionsto numerous grave problems of the contemporaryworld. An expression of that commitment anddetermination is our candidature for a non-permanentseat on the Security Council in 2008-2009."
"45",1865,"DEU",59,2004,"Let me firstof all congratulate you  President Ping  on yourelection and wish you every success in yourresponsible post  and express my sincere thanks to theoutgoing President for his dedicated work.I endorse the statement of the NetherlandsEuropean Union presidency.At the dawn of the twenty-first century  the worldis changing at dramatic speed. In just a few decades humanity will have reached the 8 billion mark. Withthe networking of world trade and with globalcommunication technologies  we are growing ever closer.We are going to become increasingly interdependent ineconomic  technical and ecological terms.At the same time  we all face a host of newchallenges and new dangers which threaten us all —the South and the North  the developing and thedeveloped world alike.On the one hand  there are threats to national andglobal security such as the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction  the nuclear threat  the danger posedby failed States or  as we all painfully remember in thiscity  by terrorism  which does not respect humankindor human dignity.On the other hand  there are also so-called softthreats  such as far-reaching environmental andclimatic changes  poverty  major shortfalls in educationand training and the negative aspects of globalization refugee flows  and diseases and epidemics such asHIV/AIDS and malaria. They are a threat to securityand stability and take a heavy toll.The two — hard and soft threats — are closelyconnected. After all  we know that the causes of warand violence  poverty  need and oppression aremultifaceted and deep-rooted. We also know that crisesare the fruit of poverty and a sense of hopelessness and vice-versa. We will have no peace withoutdevelopment  nor indeed development without peace so we have comprehensively to secure peace andstability — above all through economic and socialdevelopment.The States of the world have to work together toshape economic  technological and ecologicalglobalization and rise to the resulting challenges. Theywill not be able to do so without close cooperation.Indeed  that is now beyond the tools of traditionaldiplomacy alone. Their ability to secure and stabilizethe international system on their own will in futureprove less and less adequate.What we need is a far-reaching reform of theinternational system and its institutions that takes dueaccount of these changes. That is a reform we needurgently  because we have to create an effectivemultilateral system which enables us to work togetherto prevent crises and  where that does not work  findlong-term solutions.There have already been promising developmentsat the regional level. With their sometimes painful historyvery much in mind  the States of Europe have joinedtogether in the European Union and thus have reacheda new level of multilateralism. This political andeconomic community  now embracing 25 States  hasbecome an anchor of stability for Europe and beyond.Since its foundation the African Union has beenimpressively shouldering its shared responsibility forpreventing humanitarian disasters and resolving majorregional conflicts. This is a courageous and key stepforward. This breakthrough of multilateralism on theAfrican continent will develop an ever morepronounced dynamism.Given global interdependencies and connections we need a world organization that has close links tothese regional structures and can thus boost theefficiency of joint action. The United Nations is themost important forum for setting global rules. Its mightis the might of the right  as the Secretary-Generalhighlighted in his impressive speech at the opening ofthis General Assembly session. With its legitimacy wehave a unique and universal competence for solvingproblems together. Since the breaking of the internalblockade caused by the cold war  the United Nationshas been playing an increasingly significant role. Theinternational community is making more and more useof it as a forum for tackling the major challengesfacing humanity.For millions of people today the Blue Flag meansquite tangible help  often on essential issues  and hopefor a better future. For this  we are all very muchindebted to the Organization and its staff. They are onthe ground in many crisis regions in Latin America Europe  Africa and Asia.It is becoming ever clearer that differentapproaches must be found to prevent or resolve each17individual crisis. The commitment of the UnitedNations in all crisis areas is the proof. In Afghanistanand in the Balkans  in Haiti and in the Great Lakesregion the United Nations is already making aconsiderable contribution. But we must realize thatthere will not be fewer conflicts in the future  and thedemands made of the Organization will grow.Against this backdrop the question arises whetherthe structures given to the United Nations at itsfoundation almost sixty years ago are still suited to thismandate  whether its work enjoys the internationalacceptance it needs. In particular  the disputesconcerning the Iraq crisis highlighted this problemonce again.We are convinced there is no alternative to aworld acting multilaterally. To make this multilateralcooperation sustainable and capable  we need acourageous and comprehensive reform of the UnitedNations that faces up to the challenges we are facing.It was the Secretary-General himself who tookthe initiative  and for this we extend our thanks. To thatend  he appointed a panel of high-level internationalexperts who are to present him with reform proposalsat the end of the year. We look forward to that reportand the ensuing debate with great interest.What is at stake is a new  shared understanding ofthe Charter system. How can we shape prevention tomake it more effective  and peace-building to make itmore sustainable? How can we further implement theproposals on the reform of peacekeeping? What exactlydo we understand by the right of self-defence? How dowe define terrorism? The answer to this question inparticular seems clear  yet real agreement would take us the international community of States  a step forward.A number of very concrete proposals on thereform of the United Nations institutions have alreadybeen presented. Let me therefore outline some thoughtson this matter.I want to start with the General Assembly. It isthe central organ of the United Nations  the only onewith universal membership. For this very reason  theAssembly has to be more than an annual forum wherewe just go through the motions. What we need to dofirst is focus our topics more carefully. We have todiscuss the truly crucial issues — otherwise  essentialquestions will be dealt with in other forums. Secondly we need more efficient working methods.The Economic and Social Council has to finallybecome the central organ in the United Nations systemfor consultation and decision-making on economic andsocial issues. We believe that the Council has at twolevels vast potential that has yet to be fully tapped. Onthe one hand  that body maintains a network ofexpertise unequalled in the world. We have to makebetter and more targeted use of it. On the other hand we see the Economic and Social Council as a partnerfor the Security Council for peacekeeping  as laiddown in Article 65 of the Charter. When it comes tofighting the causes of conflicts and to post-crisisrehabilitation  the Economic and Social Council has animportant role to play that can support SecurityCouncil efforts for conflict prevention and peace-building. We should grant the Economic and SocialCouncil more competences in the operative sphere.After all  the efforts we make in peace missionswill be successful only if the military commitment isfollowed by a longer phase of stabilization  and veryoften that phase turns out to be the most difficult one.The Economic and Social Council advisory groups onpost-crisis rehabilitation in Africa are a step in theright direction. That is what the decisive link betweenconflict management and development cooperationcould indeed look like.Such an all-embracing approach needsappropriate financial resources. The instrument ofvoluntary contributions has proven insufficient ineveryday life  and therefore I propose earmarking acertain share of the United Nations peacekeeping budgetfor post-crisis rehabilitation. This means we couldachieve what we have long been trying  a “preventionshare”  which — let us remember Haiti — could helpus save the costs of conflicts flaring up again.Many criticize the proliferation of subsidiary andsubordinate organizations of the United Nations. Ofcourse  a reduction cannot be an end in itself. But weought to exercise enough self-criticism to ask ourselveswhether it would not be better to pool competences insome cases.However  there are also spheres that need to bebetter equipped. I am thinking here  for example  of thehandling of environmental issues in the United Nationssystem. We thus support the proposal made by FrenchPresident Jacques Chirac last year to upgrade theUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to aspecialized agency with universal membership. That18could considerably strengthen UNFP’s contribution tosustainable development.At the heart of the reform of the United Nationsis the organ shouldering the central responsibility forinternational peace: the Security Council. Conflicts areon the increase. They stretch across all continents  andthey are growing in complexity. In turn  theresponsibility and competences of the Council haveexpanded constantly. Crisis prevention will play anincreasingly important role. And for peace-building ever more comprehensive strategies  closer cooperationand additional resources will be needed. This willmean more and more decisions that entail long-termobligations  create new international law and makemajor inroads into State sovereignty.If we really want Security Council decisions to beaccepted as legitimate and implemented effectively  wehave to reform the Council. It has to more broadlyrepresent a world organization that today embracesmore than 191 countries. That is inconceivable withoutincreasing the number of seats — for permanent andnon-permanent members alike. The reasons behindsuch a move speak for themselves.A Council with more members would enjoygreater acceptance internationally as a basis for greaterauthority. The more balanced and comprehensiverepresentation of all continents — also among thepermanent members — would lead to a better sense ofownership of the Security Council for all States.Similarly  an enlargement would considerably bolsterthe motivation of the new Council members to make along-term contribution to realizing the goals of theUnited Nations.The enlargement must adequately reflect seachanges such as decolonization  the end of the cold warand globalization. The composition of the Councilmust ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality.That means that all major regions of the South must berepresented by permanent members in the SecurityCouncil. At the same time  account has to be taken ofMembers that can and want to make a particularlymeaningful and sustainable contribution to maintainingworld peace and international security and to realizingthe purposes of the Organization. That twofoldapproach would increase the Council’s efficiency andits ability to act and to assert itself.For 40 years  the composition of the SecurityCouncil has remained unchanged. I believe it is hightime to adapt it to the new global reality. Half-baked orinterim solutions are neither necessary nor helpful.Like Brazil  India and Japan  Germany too is ready totake on the responsibility associated with a permanentseat in the security Council. But it is especiallyimportant to us that the African continent berepresented among the new permanent members.A second aspect also has to be taken into accountin Security Council reform. All in all  a greater numberof Member States that are engaging themselves in thework of the United Nations should be able to get moreinvolved in the work of the Security Council. For thatto happen  additional non-permanent seats also have tobe created. That would mean that the balance betweenpermanent and non-permanent members could beretained.As I said before  United Nations reform will bethe central and defining theme of this GeneralAssembly session. I thus call upon Member States: letus use the fifty-ninth session  right up until the nextsession in 2005  to launch the overdue reforms andachieve tangible results. We  the Member States  haveto muster the political insight  the will and thecreativity to adapt the Organization to the globalreality. Germany is ready to make a committedcontribution."
"46",1902,"DJI",59,2004,"Theprotracted period of tension that the internationalcommunity is currently experiencing underscores theneed for greater cooperation and commitment. It isfortunate  therefore  that during the past year theGeneral Assembly benefited from the capable guidanceof President Julian Hunte. The wealth of experience ofhis successor  Mr. Jean Ping  together with his greatdiplomatic acumen and insight  lead us to feelconfident that he is in the right place at the right time.We pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for the exemplary manner in which he haspromoted the United Nations and maintained andincreased its relevance for the most critical issues ofthe day. The degree to which the United Nations isconsulted on and participates in pivotal events and theresolution of crises throughout the world is a tribute toMr. Annanís selfless dedication to the Organization.He is also to be commended for the closerworking relationship that he has been able to fosterwith the private sector and civil society through theglobal compact  with the aim of offering help andexpertise to needy communities and young people.As the Secretary-General stated in his most recentreport on the work of the Organization  the UnitedNations ó indeed  the world ó has had a very difficultand challenging year. Many of us have beentraumatized by terrorism  by the brutal acts ofrepression that are taking place in many parts of theworld and by the tense situation and developments inIraq.For the majority of the worldís people  however the most immediate threats are those of hunger poverty  lack of drinking water  environmentaldegradation and endemic or infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and malaria. Overall  theSecretary-General notes that we have departedconsiderably from the vision and spirit of theMillennium Declaration of 2000  which embodied the14aspirations of our time: a world united by commonvalues  with the primary goal of providing better livingconditions for humanity  in an environment of peaceand security.Unfortunately  as the Secretary-General notes events related to terrorism have shaken our sense ofcommon purpose. The tragedy of 11 September 2001 the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  the ongoingbloodshed in the Middle East and other disturbingincidents throughout the world have profoundlydivided the international community about how toensure our collective security.While we have seen many examples of Stateterrorism  terrorism has become essentially statelessand nebulous in nature  and is able to spread withoutregard to borders or nationalities. Although there is nodisputing the fact that terrorism must be confrontedpromptly and vigorously  the knee-jerk reaction ofattempting to crush it militarily fails to address itsmany manifestations or get to its root causes.We must pay special heed to our prejudices andfears as we endeavour to resolve difficult politicalproblems that may have been building for decades.We must also accept that terrorism is not a faithor an ideology. It may well be a tactic or a strategy oflast resort on the part of those who view themselves their faith  their beliefs or their physical environmentas endangered. While we must act resolutely inconfronting acts of terrorism  to do so precipitately without examining the underlying causes  could provedestructive or even fatal. No one should excuse thebrutal and heinous crimes that are being committed inso many places today  but we must acknowledge thatthe situation requires us to find a solution.The international community is threatened by theinstability that this phenomenon entails. We must notunderestimate the importance of realistic foreign anddevelopment policies directed at resolving tensions andreducing poverty. We must find a way to bring theworld together to reconcile differences and eliminatereasons for misunderstanding. The words and thoughtsof the late American President  Franklin D. Roosevelt are relevant here. For him  security meant not onlysafety from attack by outside aggressors  but alsoeconomic  social and moral security. As he said essential to such a peace is a decent standard of livingfor all individuals  for freedom from fear is eternallylinked with freedom from want.We are all aware of the commitments we made atthe Millennium Summit in 2000. The critical needs andills confronting mankind were identified at thatSummit  and we committed to resolving them invarious ways and according to a specific timetable. Theeight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)represent a worldwide quest to eliminate poverty andhunger while improving health care  education and theenvironment.Sadly  an evaluation of progress towards reachingthese goals by the target dates reveals that we aremaking erratic progress. A recent study in Genevafound that the world is scarcely making a third of theeffort necessary to achieve these modest targets. Inparticular  the eighth goal  which calls for a globalpartnership of rich and poor countries for development envisioned a substantial increase in officialdevelopment assistance (ODA)  a reduction orcancellation of debts  the removal of protectionistbarriers for agricultural products and free access to themarkets of the industrialized countries. Needless tosay  progress on this goal has been limited. It is theonly goal lacking a deadline or timetable and ishampered by the apparent reluctance of developedcountries to keep their commitments.Of the 50 least developed countries (LDCs)  34are in Africa. Although five or six African countriesare close to transitioning  only one has successfullymade a smooth transition. Attempts to mobilizedomestic resources through the private sector willrequire more time and funds. Low levels of savings andinvestment rates testify to the huge decline in resourcesneeded for development. Undoubtedly  there is anurgent need to continually increase developmentassistance to this group of countries.Africa's need for development assistance hascreated the impression that the continent is a majorfinancial burden to the international community. Infact  while Africa is disproportionately aid-dependent it does not receive a disproportionate amount of aid.Overall  as things stand  LDCs will not be able toreduce poverty  achieve universal primary education orreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. A report bythe United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment (UNCTAD) describes LDCsí woefuldeficits in savings dedicated to growth  publicinvestment and essential services. The report alsostates that the conclusion is unequivocal and that on15the basis of domestic resources alone  LDCs cannot liftthemselves out of poverty.Today  in a post-11-September world  a newrationale for aid is emerging. Aid is increasingly seenas a potent force in the war on terror by providingsupport to both front-line States and weak States inwhich terrorism could breed. Additionally  there is amounting recognition of endemic poverty and of theinequalities that threaten national security interests.Despite this realization  however  developmentassistance programmes have become more selective aimed at a small group of countries that are in someway qualified. Nevertheless  many countries fail toqualify for this aid. Concrete actions must be taken forthe sake of the millions suffering in those countries.We ignore them at our own risk.Common sense tells us that conflict is endemicand hardly any region in the world has escaped itsviolence. However  the reality is that no new civil warshave broken out recently  and there has been a declinein the number of drawn-out conflicts within andbetween States. We notice that although the number ofvictims has risen sharply  the number of terroristincidents has in fact declined. That said  fewer peopleare being killed by war than at almost anytime in thepast century. Few wars are beginning and many oldones are ending. This is particularly true in Africa where some seven millions souls perished in theconflicts of Angola  Congo  Sudan  Sierra Leone Liberia and Somalia. With the exception of the Darfurregion in the Sudan  each one of those conflictsappears to be either coming to an end  winding downor stabilizing. Of course  we are all deeply saddened bythe scale of the tragedy in Darfur. This issue  however needs to be tackled with the greatest care  clarity fairness and seriousness. We must be cautious aboutmaking generalizations and forming prejudices toosoon. We need to direct our efforts towards the rightsolutions.Conflicts  of course  require weapons  andreducing this threat requires a halt to arms shipments.These shipments divert vital resources from othercritical needs. The countries of Asia  Latin America the Middle East and Africa spend some $22 billion onarms each year  that is  more than two thirds of armssales worldwide.Solidifying peace in the world calls for morepreventive diplomacy  peacemaking and additionalpeacekeeping missions. Unless fully supported by theinternational community through additional resources further operations would strain United Nationsplanning  pre-positioned forces  logistics  procurementand command and control capabilities. What isrequired  therefore  is greater assistance for regionalpeacekeeping capabilities  particularly in Africa.Any action undertaken must necessarily have theapproval of the United Nations. This is the only paththat confers a degree of legitimacy on any undertaking.Action undertaken by the United Nations implies theapproval of the Security Council. Here it must be notedthat the Council continues to operate in accordancewith the legacy of the Second World War in terms of itsstructure.Furthermore  the exponential growth in UnitedNations membership is not reflected in the Council.There is an urgent need for the developing world tohave a stronger voice in the Council. The Council musthave a more equitable and realistic distribution  interms of both representation and composition. SecurityCouncil reform is long overdue and there is an urgentneed to expand the reform in both the permanent andnon-permanent categories  embracing developing anddeveloped countries. We are pleased with theestablishment by the Secretary-General of the High-Level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change. Someof its initial soundings cover the expansion of theSecurity Council  recalling membersí commitment tocontribute to national and international peace andsecurity. We deem auspicious the projected full reviewof the Councilís work at the end of every decade including a review of the manpower and financialresources of peacekeeping missions. We await thePanelís report this December to the Secretary-General and we will consider his comments during the nextsession of the Assembly.The President returned to the Chair.Following the Arta Peace Conference  which weinitiated and the outlines of which I presented to thisvery Assembly several years ago  theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)member States considered it necessary to complete thisprocess by broadening its base. Since then  and to date the Somali reconciliation conference in Nairobi Kenya  under the auspices of IGAD  has achievedtangible progress  which we welcome. Particularrecognition should be addressed to all IGAD member16States for their self-sacrifice and devotion  especiallyto our brothers from Kenya  whose good offices patience and determination allowed the negotiations tocontinue even in the most critical moments. Indeed  theSomali representatives  spurred by the will of theregion and the convergence of political and financialsupport of the international community  workedrelentlessly to set up the first pillar of the SomaliGovernment institutions ó that is  the TransitionalParliament. This first stage  welcomed by the Somalipeople within the country and in the diaspora  and theinternational community as a whole  finally brought aglimmer of hope that the reign of anarchy and chaoswould soon come to an end in Somalia.The divergences of view that prevailed for a longtime among the countries of the region on ways ofresolving the Somali conflict have now yielded tocommon sense and collective resolve  to work inharmony and to collaborate in a sincere and fraternalspirit towards the ultimate goal of helping our Somalibrothers achieve legitimate and lasting peace.The misunderstandings and difficultiesencountered during the process have provided anopportunity for a fresh review of the statements of thevarious regional actors for a clear-eyed and in-depthanalysis  imbued with the genuine desire to show thesolidarity of IGAD countries towards Somalia  and hasmade it possible to underscore the common need tohelp the Somali people to establish a broad-basedGovernment that is representative and legitimate. ThisConference has culminated in a Somali Parliament where all the factions and various components ofSomali civil society are represented  such asintellectuals  professionals  women and others. Lastweek  the members of Parliament elected a Speaker and today they are electing his deputies beforeproceeding on 10 October to elect the President of theTransitional Government.Without a doubt  and very importantly so  thefacts bear out that we are today in a significantlydifferent mood than the past  because this time theSomali people are more determined to deepen theirdialogue and the reconciliation process. And as aregion we are convinced that we must work togethertowards achieving the goals agreed upon. It is also theresponsibility of the international community to act ina strong and decisive manner to assist Somalia.In the first place  the international communitymust provide the necessary financial and politicalsupport to rapidly enable the new Government to createthe conditions for achieving the rehabilitation offacilities needed to house the new Government; theprovision of direct budgetary support to pay wages andother administrative expenditures; and the tackling ofsecurity issues head-on  in particular  with theimplementation of demobilization  disarmament andreintegration programmes (DDR).In this first six-month critical phase  the actionsundertaken by the new Government will determine theauthority of its legitimacy as it proceeds to consolidatethe gains obtained from the reconciliation process  withthe aim of addressing the formidable expectations ofthe Somali people.In the second place  at the political level  it isassumed that the new Transitional Parliament will bean all-inclusive body; it will agree to swear in membersof this National Assembly; and all its members willaccept the primacy of the rule of law  responsiblenorms of behaviour  disarmament and demobilization.Any contrary attitudes  actions or activities that couldundermine the efforts to pacify the country or frustratethe effectiveness of the new Government should not betolerated or accepted by the region or by theinternational community.In this respect  the Security Council  the uniquebody entrusted with the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  may be called upon to takenecessary measures in conformity with the UnitedNations Charter to apply the following measures incase the new State faces a resurgence of obstacles tothe reconciliation process or restoration of the State.These would be the implementation of a list and asystematic regime of sanctions directed against thosewho would continue to undermine the Governmentíspeace efforts.We are deeply convinced that this is a uniqueopportunity for the international community to finallyresolve the long-lasting conflict in Somalia. We need toacknowledge the changes that have taken place. TheSomalis are determined  and the region is united. Weshould  at all costs  avoid repetition of the scenario wehave experienced in the past. Let us seize thisopportunity. Let us  together  help our Somali brothersand sisters in their quest for peace  stability  and unity.17Until now  innumerable resolutions commitments  initiatives and peace processes toresolve the long-festering Middle East conflict remainat best rhetorical. A clear-cut vision of the two-Statesolution - a secure Israel side by side with a viablePalestinian State - rings hollow in the wake of a largeexpansion of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupiedPalestinian territories of the West Bank  with thebuilding of thousands of houses on land confiscatedfrom Palestinian families. All this sounds familiar.Over the last three-and-a-half decades  we havewitnessed the blatant confiscation of Palestinian land farmlands and water resources. The daily oppressionand repression of Palestinian victims is beyondcomprehension. Nevertheless  the Palestinians continueto struggle against all odds to maintain somesemblance of civil order.Making an already untenable and explosivesituation even worse  Israel  in defiance ofinternational law and public opinion  has embarked onbuilding a separation wall  which is penetrating anddividing Palestinian territory in two  well beyondIsraelís 1967 borders  thus creating facts on the ground.And  as we all know by now  Israelís proposed tacticalwithdrawal from Gaza is not a prelude to Palestinianstatehood. All these violent and deliberate actions havemade a mockery of the road map  and thus  rendered itworthless; this is the same fate that met the OsloAccords.Abandoned by the international community  thePalestinians are struck with indefinite deprivation  asense of hopelessness and statelessness. That being thecase  this Assembly has perhaps the sad duty topronounce itself incapable of constraining Israel  aMember State of this Organization  rather thancontinuing to give false hope to a people that hasalready lost everything.Djibouti  strategically situated at a crossroad ofthe seas  and serving as a gateway to the growingAfrican and Middle Eastern markets  has beenfortunate in achieving a period of sustained growth stability and improved governance. Many of ourfacilities are presently undergoing considerableimprovements to respond to  and to take advantage ofthe growing demands. A new modern port is underconstruction  the first phase being an oil terminalexpected to be operational by next year  followed by amajor container terminal  and finally by an industrialfree zone that will be the first of its kind in Africa offering light manufacturing and value-added facilitiesand services in a duty-free setting  includingwarehousing  storage and distribution.In this respect  we wish to express deep gratitudeto the inspiring and pragmatic leadership of Dubai  ourkey partner in this visionary venture  that willundoubtedly put Djibouti on the map of internationaltrade and shipping.Djibouti seeks to improve its private sectordevelopment by reducing the cost of creating or doingbusiness  by improving its labour force throughinvestments in education  training  health  socialprotection and eliminating gender disparities. TheGovernment is also working to strengthen institutionalcapacity and governance  while developing itsabsorptive capacity to better manage  as well aseffectively utilize  donor support.The Horn of Africa has seen its share of conflictand natural disasters. Together with our friends in theregion  we are resolutely engaged in mitigating theplight of our people  reducing tensions and conflict developing cooperation in the areas of transport communications  health and the environment. Regionaland international security issues and  in particular  thefight against terrorism  are of primary concern to thecountries in the Horn of Africa. Together with ourinternational partners  we are doing all we can in thefight against that scourge. The same holds true for theHIV/AIDS pandemic  tuberculosis and malaria. Ourregion has no other alternative than to strengthencooperation in all areas ó from economic developmentto improving confidence-building measures.Djibouti  friend to all  enemy of none  will spareno effort to further intensify the search for greaterregional harmony and cooperation  while promoting apluralistic  open  and healthy society at home."
"47",1924,"DMA",59,2004,"Allow me first of all tocongratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the mantleof the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. My delegation wishes to assure you ofits full support and cooperation in bringing about thesuccessful outcome of this session.My Government expresses its deepestappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  forthe outstanding manner in which he presided over thework of the fifty-eighth session. Under his visionaryleadership  significant progress was made in advancingthe revitalization of the General Assembly and inensuring the return of development to the forefront ofthe issues addressed by the Assembly.15No words of praise are adequate to describe theyeoman’s task undertaken by the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan. In an international environment ofturmoil and a world going through the turbulence ofeconomic reconstruction as globalization proceeds  theSecretary-General has remained a clear  calm andmoderating influence on all parties to conflict. Hislevel-headed approach has done much to ensure therelevance of the United Nations  which the people ofthe Commonwealth of Dominica cherish highly.The numerous challenges facing the globalizedworld demand a common endeavour from all thenations of the world. Guaranteeing human rights  peaceand security and ensuring social and economic justicefor all require international cooperation and concertedmultilateral action.Dominica is of the firm conviction that theUnited Nations continues to be the global institutionmost suited to the pursuit and coordination of theseglobal initiatives. The multilateral institutions however  need to be reformed if they are going to berelevant in the current global dispensation.The coordination of the United Nations effort  inharmony with national efforts  must be the focus of thisinstitution if it is to positively impact on the lives ofthe majority — the vulnerable and marginalized peopleof the world.Dominica is a small island State with all thestrengths  as well as the weaknesses  of countries withsmall economies. That is why we look to the UnitedNations as a forum in which small countries can airtheir views  with the aim of collectively influencing theagenda of the Organization in some way.The central question for all countries in the worldtoday relates to the kind of arrangements that willconstitute the economic order when the globalizationprocess is complete. At this stage  globalizationconsists of a wide variety of treaties  some bilateraland others multilateral. From this slew of agreements there is yet to be discerned a clear set of principles thataddress the idiosyncratic features of small island Stateswhen they function as economic units.Within the past six years  the economy of mycountry has had to withstand a number of shocks — thebyproducts of multilateral treaties to which States insituations similar to that of my country have had only aminuscule input. A dispute between the United Statesof America and the European Union resulted in aruling by the World Trade Organization that destroyedthe banana industry  which was the backbone of theeconomy of Dominica.A subsequent decision by the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development to publishwhat has been described as a “blacklist” had a veryadverse impact upon the offshore banking sector in mycountry.Dominica would like to make a plea for greatertransparency and inclusiveness in the formulation ofagreements which relate to development financing trade and international tax matters. Participation oughtto be substantive  not a mere formality  which is thecase more often than not. We do not subscribe to thenotion that mere presence constitutes significantparticipation.Notwithstanding our participation in multilateralinstitutions  the two shocks to which I referred wereexogenous — originating outside our country andhaving nothing to do with the internal economicmanagement of Dominica. A resolute commitment onthe part of the resilient population of Dominica  withthe timely help of some friendly countries andinstitutions  saved our country from total disaster.The lesson  which is abundantly clear to mycountry and to other small States  is that a new globaleconomic order must be balanced and sensitive to theinterests of its weakest members.The situation of small island developing Stateswill be the focus of attention in January 2005  when theInternational Meeting to Review the Implementation ofthe Barbados Programme of Action convenes inMauritius. The Barbados+10 Meeting will afford us theopportunity to make a full assessment of theProgramme of Action and to evaluate its successes andshortcomings.Dominica and other small island developingStates attach great importance to the InternationalMeeting. We hope that it will galvanize the internationalcommunity to make a greater commitment to providethe critical additional resources necessary foradvancing the implementation obligations of the nextphase of the Programme of Action.My country is alarmed at the rise of terrorism inthe world. Indeed  as we move towards a more unitedworld where people of different races and colours are16called upon to demonstrate greater respect andtolerance for each other  violent attempts at solutionsare counterproductive and have the unintendedconsequence of harming mere bystanders.The brutal and bloody terrorist acts of 11 September2001  committed in New York City  not only hadreverberations for relatives  friends and the society ingeneral in which the brutal murders took place  butalso had serious repercussions of an economic naturein places quite distant from the scene of the crime.That notorious event had a very deleterious effectupon the Dominican economy. It drastically contractedour tourist industry  which has yet to recover fully. Thefocus on terrorism and the cost of complying withrequirements to prevent terrorist attacks in a regionthat is renowned as a zone of peace are challenging ourcommitment to social and economic development.Every cent spent on addressing this threat is acent taken from our campaign to sustain the fightagainst trafficking in narcotic drugs and human beings the pandemic of HIV/AIDS and other communicablediseases and the degradation of our commonenvironment. Water security  food security  energysecurity and health security are other important goalsthat stand to suffer if additional resources are not foundto pursue them.Conflicts in various parts of the world areconsuming scarce resources that are critically neededfor development and poverty alleviation. On theAfrican continent  civil conflicts in the Sudan  Burundiand the Democratic Republic of the Congo are havingcatastrophic consequences for the lives of largenumbers of people. The continuing attention andsupport of the international community remainimportant prerequisites in the pursuit of efforts towardsconflict resolution.The Government of Dominica urges animmediate end to attempts to use violence as a solutionto the problems of the people of our planet and callsfor a greater degree of rationality to be employed as weaddress the very thorny problems of life today.We are satisfied that the more rational approachthat we are suggesting can solve many problems thathave been in existence for generations. Prior to theabolition of apartheid in South Africa  no one wouldhave believed that  after years of bloodshed betweenthe races  a post-apartheid political order could haveaccommodated dialogue between the races in thatcountry. The South African example shows that whenpersons of good-will and intellect get togetherproblems can be resolved without recourse to terrorand violence. The United Nations has demonstrated itscapacity to trigger the peaceful resolution of conflictsin the past  and my Government is persuaded that it cancontinue to do so if permitted.I have the great honour to be the Prime Ministerof Dominica at the age of 32. We in Dominicasubscribe to the view that the young people of anycountry are its best hope for a brighter future  to beachieved through constructive change. My presencehere attests to the commitment of the Dominican nationto treat younger generations not as inexperiencedknow-nothings  but as people with the potential toexcel  to whom we must provide the best tools forensuring quality leadership. We believe that the earlyexposure of young people to leadership and positionsof responsibility would help to accelerate the processfor achieving the goal of a world without prejudice.I have sought to summarize those issues that areof special concern to small  vulnerable States such asDominica and others in the Caribbean. In this regard  Icannot overstate the importance of the Assemblytaking cognizance of some unique features of islandlife  particularly in the tropics.As you are aware  Sir  at this time of the year small island States in the Caribbean and parts of theNorth American continent are exposed to the threat ofdevastating hurricanes. This year  major disasters haveoccurred on several islands. Unspeakable devastationhas taken place in Grenada; Jamaica has sufferedsubstantial loss of life and damage to property; parts ofthe Cayman Islands were submerged  and the death tollin Haiti and Santo Domingo has been horrendous. Inthe United States of America  the state of Florida hasexperienced disaster of immense proportions. Therecent experience of natural disasters underscores theimportance of the necessity to put in placerehabilitation programmes that would enable destroyedeconomies to be revived in the minimum time.The Government of Dominica believes that aninsurance fund should be set up under the aegis of theUnited Nations. States at risk of natural disasters thatdevastate their economies ought to be able to receiveinsurance payments to rehabilitate their economieswhen they are damaged by such natural disasters.17Participation in such an insurance plan would not be acharitable act. Each Member State would be required topay a premium that is affordable for that country  andthe funds accumulated could be used to repair damagedone to the economy  especially in cases where theproductive sector of a country’s economy has beenreduced to paralysis.Events in the last year have underscored thatpeace and security in the world  social progress andeconomic prosperity require the consensus of MemberStates  the strict implementation of universal normsand commitment to multilateral action.In that regard  the United Nations StabilizationMission in Haiti deserves the support of all MemberStates  especially those in the Latin American andCaribbean region. My Government has made animportant decision to support the humanitarian effortsto bring stability to the people of Haiti. We remainconvinced that only the full implementation of theprovisions of Security Council resolution 1542 (2004)will lead to the return of democratic governance in Haiti.Dominica commends the United Nations forbringing visibility to the problems of the world’sindigenous people during the International Decade ofthe World’s Indigenous People. With the impendingend of that Decade this year  we urge the worldcommunity to maintain the momentum of the Decadeand renew its commitment to support the futureaspirations of the world’s indigenous peoples throughgreater contributions to the Voluntary Fund forIndigenous Populations.Consistent with the overriding principle ofpursuing universal consensus and our own nationaldevelopment goals  Dominica chose on 24 March 2004to act in conformity with General Assembly resolution2758 (XXVI) of 1971 by establishing diplomaticrelations with the People’s Republic of China  therebyhonouring the one-China policy.Dominica lauds the hand of friendship extendedand the demonstrated commitment of the People’sRepublic of China to assisting small developingcountries  which are hard-pressed to fulfil their social andeconomic agendas in the light of the adverse impact ofthe evolving new world order on their economies.In the Caribbean region  as in other regions of theworld  we are witnessing the devastating impact of theproliferation of small arms. As a consequence  crimerates and civil conflicts are increasing  threatening thestability and the security of developing countries suchas mine. We therefore call for the early conclusion ofthe negotiations on a legally binding internationalinstrument to control the indiscriminate supply of smallarms and light weapons to non-State actors.In conclusion  I reaffirm Dominica’s commitmentto the United Nations agenda. For us  the UnitedNations is the embodiment of our collective will toachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Giventhat those goals will create a new world order that theyoung people of the world will inherit  I urge thatgreater numbers of youth be involved at all levels inthe decision-making process. That requires a massiveeducational programme to demystify internationalrelations and motivate more young people toparticipate and help shape their world.I wish delegates every success in their deliberationsat the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly."
"48",1968,"DNK",59,2004,"When we met a yearago  there was widespread concern that we had reachedan impasse that threatened to paralyse the UnitedNations. I am happy to note today that this loomingthreat of division is receding and is being replaced by arenewed commitment to multilateralism.In that spirit  Denmark welcomes the SecurityCouncil's unanimous adoption of its resolution 1546(2004)  on Iraq. The resolution is  first and foremost  ofgreat significance for the prospects of peace andstability in Iraq and throughout the region. It is also ofgreat importance for the Security Councilís ability toperform its role as the custodian of international peaceand security.The United Nations must play a leading role inthe political process and in the reconstruction of Iraq.The wisdom and skill of the Secretary-General and hisSpecial Adviser have advanced this process  and wehope that the advisory role of the United Nations willbe further enhanced. We urge all Member States tosupport the interim Government of Iraq in itsendeavours to establish peace and security in Iraq.The year 2005 will be the year in which MemberStatesí willingness to work towards a strong  unitedand effective United Nations will be tested. Thechallenge is to develop credible  effective andcomprehensive United Nations responses to the threatsand challenges of the new millennium  whether they beconflict prevention  conflict resolution and peace-building  or the fight against terrorism and theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction  orrespect for human rights and international law  last butcertainly not least  the enormous challenge ofachieving the Millennium Development Goals.45Denmark strongly supports the Secretary-General'sHigh-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change andlooks forward to its report later this year. Efforts to reformthe Organization  including enlarging the membership ofthe Security Council  must continue if the UnitedNations is to meet the new challenges. Democracy isalso a question of representation  and if large parts ofthe world do not feel represented in the SecurityCouncil there is a risk that they will not feel bound byits decisions. The Security Council must reflect therealities of the world of today  not those of the past.We live in a world in which the distinctionbetween military and non-military threats isincreasingly blurred. Most current threats are complexand combine elements of both. Creating synergiesamong development  political and security componentswill be the key to the success of the United Nations.Denmark will endeavour to assist in this process acrossthe full range of United Nations activities.Denmark is a candidate for election to theSecurity Council during this session of the GeneralAssembly. If elected  the focus of Denmarkís tenure inthe Council will be to seek new and more effectiveways of integrating security and development andstrengthening international law. In that connection  Iwelcome the Secretary-Generalís important openingstatement in this debate (see )  in which heoutlined the fundamental principles for a world orderbased on international law.Greater coherence is needed in internationalpeace operations. We firmly believe that the UnitedNations needs to give civilian crisis management thesame priority that is accorded to military crisismanagement. More than 40 per cent of countriesemerging from conflict slide back into conflict. Inorder to build sustainable peace  much more attentionneeds to be given to the civilian aspects of crisismanagement. This includes the demobilization andreintegration of combatants as well as the social economic and legal reconstruction of war-torn societies.We must make State-building a central goal ofconflict management and peace-building  alongside theprovision of basic security. Whatever mechanism weset up  the challenge is to ensure the involvement of allstakeholders. That includes national Governments  theSecretariat  United Nations development funds andprogrammes  the Bretton Woods institutions  regionalorganizations and bilateral donors.In order to improve compliance with SecurityCouncil resolutions  the process towards targeted andsmarter sanctions should be continued. The challengeis twofold. First  the Security Council must rigorouslyimplement its resolutions  including when theystipulate serious consequences in case of non-compliance. Secondly  the countries concerned must begiven positive incentives to comply with thoseresolutions.Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction are serious threats to peace andsecurity and impede progress towards stability andprosperity. Terrorists threaten the everyday life andvalues of millions of innocent individuals. Terroristsmust be stopped by hard power and by soft power toprevent decades of unrest and terror.Countering new threats requires a multifaceted integrated response by the United Nations and itspartners. Success demands synergy  a finely tuned mixof diplomacy  aid  police efforts  intelligence  legalassistance and - if need be - military power. TheUnited Nations must take a leading role in the fightagainst terrorism  providing both the framework forglobal efforts and the legitimacy for collective action.Terror must not lead to isolation; it must not stopglobalization. In the world of today  huge globaldisparities in resources have become apparent toeverybody. Social and economic exclusion  as well asdeficient democracies  the absence of the rule of lawand lack of respect for human rights  contribute topolitical radicalization and religious extremism.Ensuring that new generations have access to thebenefits of globalization - such as democracy andhope for a better future - is a global challenge.The main responsibility for fighting terrorism lieswith individual States. This includes compliance withrelevant Security Council resolutions  as well asratification and implementation of the 12 UnitedNations conventions against terrorism. Denmarksupports efforts to reinvigorate the Counter-TerrorismCommittee (CTC). We support efforts to renew andupgrade the offer of technical assistance to countriesthat need it. The work of the CTC must be betterfocused and linked with the assistance extended tocountries that have the will - but lack the means ó tomeet the requirements of Security Council resolution1373 (2001).46Just as important  we must strengtheninternational agreements to prevent the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. Denmark thereforesupports Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)  andlooks forward to its full implementation.The United Nations has been instrumental inestablishing the core international human rightsconventions. This year we are celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of one of those conventions - theConvention on the Elimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination against Women. The importance of theelimination of discrimination against women and ofensuring respect for the right of women to decidefreely over their own lives - including in mattersrelating to marriage  reproductive health andHIV/AIDS - is self-evident. This main message of theCairo Programme of Action  adopted 10 years ago  isas relevant today as ever.With a view to eradicating torture  Denmark callsupon all States to sign and ratify the Optional Protocolto the Convention against Torture  so that it can enterinto force at an early date.We are now in the era of implementation of thosehuman rights commitments that have been undertaken.As the main body in its field  the Commission onHuman Rights has a crucial role to play in this respectand should be further strengthened.2005 will be a defining moment for the UnitedNations. World leaders will meet in New York to takestock of progress in the implementation of theMillennium Declaration. That meeting will provide aunique opportunity to break new ground  push aheadwith the interlinked agenda of peace  security anddevelopment and follow up the recommendations ofthe High-level Panel.A key priority for Denmark will be to speed upthe implementation of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. The results so far are not sufficientlyencouraging - especially with regard to Africa.Denmark attaches the highest priority to Africaísdevelopment and would like the situation there and itsprospects to be high on the agenda at the 2005 summit.In order to reach the Millennium DevelopmentGoals  an effective partnership will be requiredbetween developed and developing countries. The gapbetween goals and resources must be closed. We aredeeply concerned about the inadequacy of the currentlevel of development financing. Further resources areneeded  as is better coordination in their allocation.Last year  Denmark took the lead in making ourcommitments transparent in a Millennium DevelopmentGoals report. A new report will be published nextmonth. We call on all other States to do likewise.Development efforts and conflict resolution inAfrica must go hand in hand. Progress achieved ineconomic and social development will be sustainableonly if we manage to put an end to conflict on theAfrican continent. We stand ready to support thesignificant and sustained efforts undertaken by theAfricans themselves in this regard. There is a need tofurther strengthen the African security architecture incooperation with the African Union  subregionalAfrican organizations  the United Nations  theEuropean Union and Governments acting bilaterally.We also need to strengthen the regional approaches ofthe United Nations in the field. Denmark stands readyto contribute actively.Furthermore  recent natural disasters illustrate theimportance of dealing with international environmentalissues such as climate change  biodiversity deforestation and desertification.The Secretary-General has shown greatleadership in pressing for strengthened and effectivemultilateralism  and things are slowly starting to cometogether. Our common voyage will not be over with the2005 summit - far from it. The High-level Panel'sreport  a renewed focus on post-conflict intervention  andthe implementation of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals can herald a new age of strong and effectivemultilateralism if  collectively  we rise to the challenge.The task of this generation is to hand the world tothe next generation in better shape than we received it.Denmark will spare no effort in its endeavours totranslate that vision into reality."
"49",2013,"DOM",59,2004,"It is a great honour for me today toaddress the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on behalf of the Government of Leonel Fernández andof the people of the Dominican Republic  in this forumdevoted to the maintenance of peace and the promotionof development and harmony among peoples. Onceagain  we are speaking out on the most delicate andimportant issues on the international agenda so that wecan join forces in the search for viable solutions to theproblems that affect us all.I extend my sincerest congratulations to you  Sir on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. We are confidentthat you will steer our work along the path of peaceand security for the good of mankind. We alsounderscore the important work accomplished by theoutgoing President  Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia.The Dominican Republic has been struck by aforce of nature that has left death and destruction in itswake in various parts of the country. The rain and thewind of Hurricane Jeanne had severe consequences forthe eastern part of our country  destroying homes means of communication  bridges  crops and touristinfrastructure  at a time when the Dominican Republichad been making increasing efforts to jumpstart itseconomy. We take this opportunity to express ourthanks for the international community’s solidarity inthese difficult times for the Dominican Republic. Iwould also like to express my deepest thanks toSecretary-General Kofi Annan  who has expressedsolidarity with our country and with Haiti in thecontext of this natural disaster.The fact of globalization steadily deepensrelations among our countries  challenging our capacityto take advantage of the opportunities thatglobalization offers  as well as our capacity to limit itsnegative impact. Together with the contradictory andcomplex processes of integration and disintegration our countries still hope that the benefits ofglobalization will create conditions making it possibleto overcome poverty and attain a good life.A tragic event that occurred in this city of NewYork on 11 September 2001 changed the destiny ofhumankind in a matter of minutes  and made the worldincreasingly dangerous and insecure. The promise oflasting peace presaged by the end of the cold war wasdestroyed by terrorist actions — actions which werecondemned by all humankind and which haveunleashed a steady escalation of violence that hasturned the world into a place of uncertainty.We must spare no effort to rid humankind of thethreat of terrorism. We condemn terrorist acts in all14their forms and manifestations  whatever their sourceand whomever may be affected  and want tounderscore the importance of international cooperationin the fight against that scourge  which should alwaysbe prosecuted in strict compliance with internationallaw  and  in particular  with human rights andinternational humanitarian law.The Dominican Republic is founded on anunconditional commitment to the norms and principlesof international law  and particularly those that relate tothe peaceful settlement of disputes  the condemnationof the use of force  compliance in good faith withinternational treaties and the implementation of theresolutions of the United Nations and its deliberativebodies  including the General Assembly  the SecurityCouncil and the Commission on Human Rights.We reaffirm the view to which countriescommitted themselves in May 2004 at the thirdSummit Conference of Heads of State and Governmentof Latin America and the Caribbean and of theEuropean Union  as set out in paragraph 8 of theDeclaration of Guadalajara:“[A]n effective multilateral system  based oninternational law  supported by stronginternational institutions and with the UnitedNations at its centre  is essential for achievingpeace and international security  sustainabledevelopment and social progress.”However  in order to achieve those objectives wemust streamline  modernize and reform the entiremultilateral international system  a process that Statesmust support through respect for and compliance withthe resolutions adopted  without neglecting genuineand effective equitable regional participation.Multilateralism is one of the main pillars of theforeign policy of the Dominican Republic  as can beseen by our participation and cooperation in allinternational forums. For that reason  we join thosenations that call for a thorough reform of the UnitedNations system  with a view to enhancing itsdemocratization and making it a more effectiveinstrument for States Members. That reform must begeared  first of all  towards strengthening the GeneralAssembly  the most important body of theOrganization  and the Security Council  in which thereis unequal geographical representation. We reiterate yetagain the suggestion that has been made for severalyears now: the Security Council should be expanded sothat Asia  Africa and Latin America can have twopermanent members  and the number of non-permanentseats should be increased in order to democraticize thedecision-making mechanism of that forum for peace.Those reforms are necessary to make the multilateralsystem more agile and effective  so that it may moresuccessfully confront global threats and challenges.I would like to echo the commitment undertakenby the heads of State or Government who met in SantoDomingo in August and adopted the Declaration ofSanto Domingo 2004  in which we agreed that:“[t]he fight against poverty is essential to theconsolidation of democracy. In that regard  it isnecessary to formulate and implement publicpolicies aimed at strengthening economic growthand an equitable distribution of national incomeand wealth.”As we are all aware  the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) has reported that the richest 20per cent of Latin America’s population receives 54 percent of national income  whereas the poorest 20 percent of population receives only four per cent. This factis an attack on governability.We want to underscore the importance of ameeting that was held at the United Nations lastweek — the gathering of world leaders in an allianceagainst hunger and poverty  which resulted in a seriouscommitment on the part of each and every one of ourrepresentatives here to fight unwaveringly andeffectively to achieve the agreed objectives.For the Government of the Dominican Republic the fight against corruption is a priority. We haveshown this by implementing mechanisms to preventand punish acts of corruption. That scourge has a graveimpact on the economies of our countries. We all knowthat the main victims of corruption are the poor. Weneed  above all  to strengthen existing mechanisms and to produce others if necessary  in order to wage apitched battle against corruption and those who benefitfrom it  regardless of their origin or social class. Wehave taken this decision because we see that the rise incorruption in our region has jeopardized thegovernability of all of our countries. Governmentaltransparency and a greater participation of civil societyare necessary to combat this evil.We wish to emphasize this morning theimportance and effectiveness of the follow-up15mechanism for the implementation of the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption  and its Planof Action adopted in Managua. Likewise  we ask thatour countries not be used as safe havens for personsconvicted of acts of corruption. We also advocate thereturn of those ill-gotten gains to the countries thathave fallen victim to this evil  which  together withdrug trafficking  has a negative impact on the stabilityof democracy and the enforcement of the rule of law.In recent years  Dominican Republic has madereal progress in its struggle against trafficking inpersons  where the most vulnerable populations arewomen and children  whether at the regional orinternational level. Through the establishment ofnational and international networks against traffickingin Dominican children and adolescents  and with thecooperation of the diplomatic foreign and consularservices  we have made great strides in that area. Wetake this opportunity to emphasize the participation ofthe International Organization for Migration and itsimportant support in this struggle.As for the struggle of countries against themanufacture and illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons  our country is committed to assisting in theareas of investigation and the adoption of measures forstrengthening global and regional cooperation in orderto fight against this scourge. States must continue tomake every effort to implement the Programme ofAction adopted by the United Nations Conference onthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons inAll Its Aspects.We also want to express our deep concern at thehigh level of kidnappings and crime in our countries —a level that increases year after year  thus worseningthe sense of insecurity felt by persons of all socialclasses and races. The rise in crime is a threat to thesecurity and safety of our citizens and to thedemocratic governability of all of our countries. Well-designed deterrence mechanisms based on zerotolerance  an efficient police force  and a strengthenedjudiciary will all be necessary to reduce this scourge which has a significant impact on the lives of ourcitizens.On a different topic  the Caribbean now has thesecond highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in the world.We invite the Member States of the United Nations torededicate themselves to the terms of the Declarationof Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted at the specialsession of the General Assembly on 27 June 2001.Dominican legislation includes law 55-93 onHIV/AIDS  which is now in the process of beingreformed and which represents one of the few existingpieces of legislation in our region regarding thatdisease. We reiterate the request for cooperation to theinternational community so that  through financing  thecountries most seriously affected can have moreresources to deal with the consequences of that illnessin order to provide the comprehensive care that is verynecessary  as well as the antiretroviral medications tocombat the illness. This is based on the right of allcitizens to life and health.In recent years and in most international forums our country has referred to the grave crisis confrontingthe sister republic of Haiti. We have drawn attention tothe fact that the Dominican Republic could not andcannot bear the weight of this crisis and itsconsequences on its shoulders alone. On more than oneoccasion we have called on the internationalcommunity for solidarity. We do so with the intent ofbeginning a far-reaching process that can help infinding a solution to this problem. Today  we see thatovercoming this crisis represents a major challenge tothe United Nations  and therefore we support theprocess that began through the United NationsStabilization Mission in Haiti. We consider it veryimportant that the Haitian people see this peacefulmission as the participation of the internationalcommunity in the stabilization of their nation  and thatthey at no time view it as an occupation force.Hurricane Jeanne has caused thousands of deathsand much destruction in the area of Gonaïves  Haiti thus deepening the economic and humanitarian crisis inthat country. Now  more than ever  we call on theinternational community and international financialbodies to provide the necessary financial resources thatcan place that nation on the path toward stability andprogress.Many regions of the world have not yet achievedthe peace to which they aspire. Despite all the effortsundertaken in that regard  innocent people continue tolose their lives in a conflict that for decades hascharacterized the instability of the Middle East.The Dominican Republic avails itself of thisforum to reaffirm its unrestricted support for the peaceprocess begun between Israel and Palestine during the161991 Madrid Conference  for the Oslo Agreements  forthe recommendations made by United States SenatorGeorge Mitchell in his final report and for the roadmap presented by President George Bush andsupported by Russia and the European Union.Finally  the Dominican Republic reiterates itsposition  expressed in various forums  on the need for aconstructive dialogue between the nations located onboth sides of the Straits of Taiwan in order to ensurepeace and security in that region.I conclude by expressing the hope that thisoccasion has enabled the Governments represented atthis meeting to reflect seriously on our destiny — thedestiny of all men and women who live on Earth —and also that the United Nations will be able  with thecooperation of States  to establish the balancenecessary for the benefit of international peace andsecurity."
"50",2060,"DZA",59,2004,"I feelespecially proud as an African to see that Mr. Jean Pingis presiding over this session of the General Assembly.I believe that his qualities as a human being and hisvast experience are a valuable asset to the UnitedNations at a difficult time in international relations when the Organization must play an even greater rolein accordance with its mission and the expectations ofthe peoples of the world. In order to discharge fully itsresponsibilities and the tasks entrusted to it  the UnitedNations must now adjust and adapt  and must reformthe structures and machinery that will enable it tostrengthen its capacity for action.There is still much tension in the internationalsituation; indeed  new sources of instability anduncertainty are appearing. A comprehensive approachis required  given the inextricable interdependence ofall those issues on all levels - political  economic social and cultural. Today more than ever  security isone and indivisible. Security cannot even be conceivedof without a determined struggle against terrorism. Itcannot shirk the requirement that it step up efforts forconflict settlement and prevention  nor can it disregardthe pressing need to encourage worldwide developmentthat is balanced  equitable and sustainable. It must bebased on genuine dialogue - a dialogue betweenreligions  cultures and civilizations.There is no doubt at all that excellent work hasbeen done  since the struggle against terrorism becamethe absolute priority of the international community.Yet  despite the efforts made and resources put towardsthat struggle  there remains much to be done. Inparticular  it is essential that we reach agreementquickly on a common definition of terrorism so that wecan be clear about the legitimacy of the struggle ofpeoples against foreign occupation and can stopaccepting distorted  confused  ill-conceived viewpointsthat see terrorism as part of just one geographicalregion  religion  culture or civilization. Drafting acomprehensive convention against terrorism is moreurgent and important than ever before. It is somethingwe have been calling for now  for more than ten years.Very close to Algeria  there is a conflict betweenthe Polisario Front and the Kingdom of Morocco thathas been going on for almost 30 years. It is adecolonization issue that has not been resolved. TheUnited Nations has clearly established that WesternSahara remains a non-self-governing territory underSecurity Council resolution 1541 (2004). As in the caseof Brunei  Surinam  Belize and Timor-Leste  the peaceplan was unanimously accepted by the SecurityCouncil and provides a just and definitive frameworkfor a settlement  through the Saharawi peopleís freeexercise of their inalienable right to self-determination.In seeking a satisfactory solution  Algeria hasalways supported the Secretary-General of the UnitedNations and his personal envoy  Mr. James Baker  whohas truly earned the respect of our Organization for histireless efforts. Algeria will continue to support theUnited Nations peace plan and remains fully availableto contribute towards the implementation of the plan in order to strengthen stability in our region andsolidarity among our peoples.Here I would reiterate that Algeria cannot decidethe future of the Western Sahara for its people and doesnot want to do so. Any attempt to address the issue ofthe Western Sahara in a context other than that ofcompleting the decolonization process - part of theresponsibility of the United Nations - will result inthe failure of that process and will delay a finalsettlement.Intensive efforts are underway within the AfricanUnion to ensure peace and security in Africa  effortsthat are leading to prospects for settlement of regionalconflicts. Those efforts reflect Africaís firm resolve tobecome part of a new era of stability  security andprogress.The conditions for establishing a genuinelybalanced and mutually beneficial partnership betweenAfrica and its partners through the New Partnership forAfricaís Development (NEPAD)  have never been asfavourable as they are today. A promising change inthat relationship is now emerging and gainingimportance. For that reason it is extremely important tocontinue encouraging Africa as it seeks to succeed inits work towards peace  development and integration which it has firmly started.31In the occupied Palestinian territories the peaceprocess is deadlocked  more than ever before. It is nowmore difficult to find a just and lasting solution to theArab-Israeli conflict because of the brutal repression ofPalestinian civilians; endless attacks against thePalestinian Authority  its institutions and its leaders;the continuation of a settlement policy; the building ofthe separation wall  in violation of international law asaffirmed by the International Court of Justice; Israelísrejection of obligations entered into in Oslo and itsmanoeuvering to take everything of substance awayfrom the road map.In that same region  the Iraqi people face a tragicsituation and many complex challenges that require thesupport of the international community and the UnitedNations.At the dawn of the millennium  we all undertookto take up the challenges that we wanted to facetogether through a responsible global partnership. In allsincerity  can we be content with the meager resultsachieved to date? It is our hope that the summit in2005  incidentally the sixtieth anniversary of theUnited Nations  will be an opportunity for us toconfirm our commitments and to finally take the boldsteps that are needed to translate commitments intoaction  to eradicate poverty  destitution anddeprivation  promote sustainable development andensure peace and stability for all peoples."
"51",2107,"ECU",59,2004,"Ihave the honour to represent the President of Ecuador Mr. Lucio Gutiérrez Borbúa  and the people of Ecuadorin this world forum of nations  to affirm once againthat my country  Ecuador  is an ally of Statescommitted to peace and the peaceful settlement ofdisputes. Ecuador is a law-abiding country  upholds theprinciple of international security and solidarity and isa staunch defender of all the mandates arising from theCharter of the United Nations.It is worth highlighting once again that Ecuador in its relations with the international community opposes all forms of discrimination or segregation colonialism or neocolonialism. On this occasion  theGovernment of Ecuador must once again ask thecommunity of nations and the international financialorganisms to not lose sight of the heavy burden on ourcountries represented by the service of the debt  which year after year  severely strains our economies. TheEcuadorian Government calls on the United Nations tomove forward with greater determination in identifyingspecific actions aimed at effectively reducing existingpressures  and  furthermore  in formulating proposalsto efficiently address with this issue in the long termand enable our countries to develop.The Government of Ecuador must also drawattention to one of the most momentous problemsafflicting the international community  namely theprotection of civilians in armed conflict. This terribleproblem reflects a reality entirely at odds with the mostelementary ethical and moral principles of humanconduct and that destroys the basic premises ofcivilized co-existence  in which respect for life and thedignity of all individuals must necessarily be a priority.It is time for the international community and theUnited Nations to give absolute priority to this issueand to find the political will and determination totackle and eliminate every bloody and inhumanconflict in which international humanitarian law nolonger prevails. The Security Council is duty-bound  inaccordance with the Charter of the United Nations  toreinforce the protection of civilians in armed conflicts in order to avoid undermining the entire internationaljuridical structure.True to its international commitments and itshumanitarian vocation  Ecuador has been welcomingthousands of refugees and immigrants from Colombiaand other countries who have fled their countriesbecause their lives  freedom and economic securityhave been threatened. We must remind theinternational community that  in order to solve thiscritical situation  we need the commitment of everycountry and international organism. For this reason  itis essential that in conformity with principles of sharedresponsibility and shared burdens  countries  such asEcuador  which take in refugees and immigrants should receive greater technical and economic support.This support is necessary to alleviate the social burdenresulting from large numbers of persons entering localborder communities  which experience higher levels ofpoverty and lack basic services.With regard to the analysis of the northern borderof Ecuador made by the United Nations inter-agencymission  we appreciate the support offered by theUnited Nations Secretary-General to implement thedevelopment proposals suggested in the report.Ecuador would also like to have the support of theinternational community and the international financialinstitutions in this undertaking.51The Government of Ecuador urges theinternational community to make good its commitmentto the implementation of programmes established byEcuador and Peru within the framework of thebi-national development plan for their common border following the signing of the peace agreements inBrasilia in 1998. These projects aim at meeting thebasic needs of the populations of the region  throughsocial programmes and infrastructure projects.However  both Ecuador and Peru require the financialsupport of the countries that pledged their assistancefor the post-conflict era.To our countries’ development problems we mustadd the persistent trade barriers which developedcountries impose on our exportable products  as well asthe subsidies worth millions that they grant to theirown products  especially agricultural ones  whichseriously limit normal competition among countries increase unemployment and threaten the future of theeducation  health and well-being of our peoples.Deteriorating conditions in developing countrieshave resulted in increased flows of migrants towardsindustrialized centres in search of employment  whichis no longer available in their own countries. In somecountries  this exodus has met with restrictive andunfair policies based on xenophobic concepts that instead of providing a solution to the existing problemand to its root causes  make it even worse.International migration is a problem that hasgrown more severe during the last decade. Each year more countries are affected by migration movements which are commanding increasing attention at thedecision-making level. Migration reflects the humanlonging to have the opportunity to pursue a betterquality of life and enjoy greater economic prospects. Italso promotes exchange and understanding betweenpeoples  strengthens dialogue and adds cultural andeconomic enrichment.The history of humanity is inconceivable withoutconstant migratory flows. It is evident  then  that theconsequences of these migration movements haveeconomic  political  social and demographic effects  asmuch for the countries of departure as for those ofarrival. In this context  and in this current era of marketglobalization  emphasis must be placed on theliberalization of the supply of services via the freemovement of persons.Ecuador is strongly committed to cooperating inthe search for solutions to this huge problem through astrict control of the illegal migration of persons and theelaboration of universal agreements that favour thedevelopment of human beings within their respectivecountries. However  to this end we require activecooperation between migrant source and recipientcountries  as well as from international organizations.My country has traditionally maintained a policyof promoting  respecting and protecting the humanrights of migrants  and for this reason  from thisGeneral Assembly  I would like to appeal to allGovernments and all sectors of society  particularlythose of the developed world that receive migrantworkers  to direct their efforts towards the protectionof the rights of this vulnerable sector of society in anon-discriminatory manner  taking into considerationthe highly positive and productive aspects ofmigration.The territory of Ecuador is home to 12nationalities and more than 17 ethnic groups. Thisdiversity has been recognized in the Constitution of theRepublic  which defines Ecuador as a social democracythat promotes the equitable distribution of welfare. Thefundamental charter of the Ecuadorian State lays downa legal framework that promotes the participation ofethnic minorities in political structures and processesand guarantees the exercise of the constitutional rightsof these groups in the public and private spheres.The Government of my country cannot fail tomention that inequality has been  and continues to be the greatest impediment to economic development andpoverty alleviation in many developing countries. Thedisparity of wealth and income currently evident withinand among many countries is a matter of concern forthe international community. In order to prevent thisinequality  we need to adopt effective multilateralmeasures aimed at effectively reducing poverty  whichin itself constitutes an affront to human dignity andconsequently harms the rights of individuals.In this sense  it has become imperative that theintent of international summits addressing issues ofdevelopment and poverty eradication become manifestthrough internal plans and programs based on enhancedinternational cooperation.The Government of Ecuador supports theseactivities  which are embodied in three key areas:poverty reduction  political governance and52transparency  and sustainable development throughequitable access to natural resources. This commitmenthas led Ecuador to be chosen as an example for theimplementation of innovative models  with the goal ofoptimizing the assistance and the quality of thecountry’s response.I believe it is essential that the voice of mycountry be heard on the topic of terrorism. Thisphenomenon has endangered the equilibrium  peace harmony  and security of the planet. It has torn thesocio-political fabric of societies  damaged financialstructures and undermined the functioning of States’security apparatus.I wish to reiterate the most unreserved supportand backing of the Government of Ecuador for allinitiatives and actions created to fight internationalterrorism in all its forms and characteristics  but alwayswithin the framework of the decisions of the UnitedNations  of international law and of absolute respectfor human rights.We must highlight the fact that hunger  ill health poverty  great economic disparities  lack of respect forhuman rights  corruption  attempts to resolve disputesand conflicts by non-peaceful means and the growingweight of external debt are the seeds of internationalinstability and insecurity; they undermine governanceand are factors that destabilize democratic institutions.The international community must become fully awareof the fact that these harsh daily realities confrontingdeveloping countries also represent a threat to worldsecurity. Therefore  we must directly combat terrorismwith a broad-based and concerted global strategy tofoster development  improve the living conditions of alarge part of the marginalized world population andencourage dialogue and tolerance  both between humanbeings and among States.The international community needs to make theprotection and security of individuals a global policyobjective. The security of the State  of society and ofindividuals requires a consideration of the threats totheir fundamental values  which are sovereignty identity and survival. Only on that basis must weestablish the parameters of political  economic andmilitary action in a globalized world.Ecuador  as a founding Member of the UnitedNations  resolutely supports the multilateral system since it constitutes the best guarantee for the fulloperation of the purposes and principles that led to itscreation and which are enshrined in its Charter. As aresult  Ecuador fully supports the current process ofreform of the United Nations  particularly of its mainbodies  such as the Security Council  along with therevitalization of the General Assembly. We areconvinced that that will contribute to more effectiveaction in the fulfilment of its mission.My country wishes to highlight the statementmade here by the Prime Minister of Spain — his wordsof solidarity with the cause of Latin American peoplesand his commitment to support the reduction of debtand of inequalities  as well as to promote andstrengthen relations between the European Union andLatin America. Ecuador welcomes this expression ofgood will shown by Spain’s Prime Minister  sinceachieving those goals will contribute to the welfare ofthe peoples.Finally  democracy and respect for Governmentslegitimately established through popular vote are thegreatest triumphs of Latin America in recent decades.No attempt whatsoever should be made to revise thisbasic principle of international policy  lest we seriouslyaffect the system of normal coexistence among nations.In conclusion  allow me to urge the internationalcommunity to always bear in mind the precious idealsof human beings that inspire this Organization  as setforth in the Preamble to its Charter  which are thefundamental mandates for its Members and variousbodies."
"52",2152,"EGY",59,2004,"It isa great pleasure to have Mr. Jean Ping presiding overthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I amconfident that his wealth of experience and the friendlyties that his sisterly country enjoys with all countries ofthe world will be a major asset for the Assembly as itdischarges its tasks.The success of the present session will build uponthe accomplishments of the fifty-eighth session underthe leadership of the previous President  Mr. JulianHunte  who made an important contribution to therevitalization of the role of the General Assembly invarious fields.I would also like to express our appreciation tothe Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to enhancethe status of the Organization and to strengthen its rolein the international arena  in particular in the area ofregional and national development.At the outset of the fifty-ninth session we mustscrutinize the international environment in which it isbeing held. We have to consider world events todetermine their direction  to decide where we stand onthem and to understand their impact  whether positiveor negative  on the achievement of our shared goal: thepromotion of international peace and security.18Indeed  we need to pause to see where this worldand this international community are heading. Is it andare we ascending towards upholding the values ofdemocracy  justice and the rule of law  or are wedescending into tyranny  the law of the jungle and theimposition of the policies of fait accompli? Can it besaid that events in the world today emanate from agenuine belief in the might of right  or do they  mostregrettably  represent a consolidation of the arroganceof power?The events witnessed by the world today are acause of grave concern to all those who believe in thetenets and principles on which the international systemwas established. We are witnessing the collapse ofnoble values and the disintegration of principles oncethought unassailable. National sovereignty andterritorial integrity are no longer sufficient to preventinterference in the internal affairs of States. Indeed those internal affairs have themselves become pretextsfor those who wish to impose their policies on others.The international situation forces us to considerthe critical question of what we seek from this worldand what we have offered in return. We claim that wewant a world free from conflict and wars  but whathave we done to create such a world? We claim that wewant an international community governed by legalityand the rule of law  as the Secretary-General said onTuesday  but are we seriously upholding the values oflegality and law? We claim that we wish to see allpeoples enjoying democracy  but should States notpractice democracy in the conduct of their foreignrelations as well?Relations among States are by nature volatile andeasy to break  but they are reparable. It may be difficultat times to repair them  but the calculations pertainingto constantly changing interests will eventually make itpossible to do so. Relations among peoples  however are different. Their wounds are readily inflamed andheal slowly or hardly at all. It is therefore incumbentupon us  in our feverish attempts to achieve our owninterests  to take special care to avoid flashpointsbetween peoples  civilizations and cultures. Theirmemories store all of their experiences andtribulations. Nothing stored in their collective memoryfades or disappears with time.For more than a decade now  Egypt has calledand continues to call for the convening of aninternational conference under United Nations auspicesto consider the phenomenon of terrorism and to agreeon means to combat it through effective collectiveinternational efforts. Proceeding from our belief in theimportance and centrality of the role of the UnitedNations in the coordination of international efforts tocombat terrorism  as exercised through the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council  we propose thatthe Assembly establish an open-ended working groupto consider proposals to increase the effectiveness andefficiency of the United Nations and its ability toachieve international anti-terrorism goals. That couldbe accompanied by the convening of regionalpreparatory meetings to catalogue regional needs andareas conducive to international cooperation  whichcould in turn ultimately lead to the adoption at aninternational summit of a draft comprehensiveframework convention to combat terrorism.I should like to take this opportunity to describethe situation in our part of the world and the threatsand challenges it faces.The main threat to the Middle East flows fromthe continued acquisition by some of nuclear weapons.While we all agree on the dangers posed by thoseweapons and on the need to halt their proliferation asone step towards eliminating them and freeinghumanity from the threat they represent  theinternational community continues to address thequestion of weapons of mass destruction selectively.While the international community seeks to impose astrict system to monitor the imports of all MemberStates within the non-proliferation regime — which incidentally  includes all Arab States — it turns a blindeye to the ongoing stockpiling of nuclear capabilitiesby one party in the region.I invite all to question whether it is acceptable forthe threat of nuclear proliferation to continue to loomover the Middle East. I leave it to all to decide whetherthe international approach to the question is fair or isone of double standards; whether it is capable ofaddressing those dangers and threats  or whether weare in need of urgent radical change. The ongoingapplication of double standards will not onlyexacerbate the risks of nuclear proliferation andweaken the belief in the credibility and centrality of therelevant international regime  but also aggravate thetense situation in the Middle East. In order to ease thattension and to avert those dangers  in 1990 PresidentMubarak launched the Egyptian initiative to create a19zone free from weapons of mass destruction in theMiddle East.In the year that has elapsed between the openingof the fifty-eighth and the fifty-ninth sessions  thesuffering of the Palestinian people has continued. ThePalestinian people has been subject to acts ofaggression and its legitimate rights have continued tobe violated. The tragedies visited upon Palestinianshave become a permanent item of newscasts andnewspaper headlines. A new report emerges every dayof the demolition of homes  the destruction ofinfrastructure  the targeting of unarmed civilians assassinations  collective punishments  and theimposition of curfews and closures. There is no end insight to such policies. All this suffering has been metby an inexplicable international silence  with theexception of some timid expression of dissatisfactionor  at best  displeasure at events unfolding there. Suchresponses entrench  rather than change  the situation offait accompli.Israel also continues to build the separation wallon Palestinian lands. The wall separates students fromtheir schools  workers from their factories and farmersfrom their fields. Had Israel’s objective in theconstruction of the wall truly been to ensure its ownsecurity  it would have built it on its own land. Theadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justicedeclared the wall’s construction illegal and called for ahalt to construction activities and for the removal ofthe sections already constructed. The opinion sent astrong message to the international community ingeneral  and to Israel in particular  to the effect that thetorch of justice still burns bright. It may have seemedto flicker  but it has not been extinguished. The scalesof justice still prevail. They may seem to have beenupset  but they have neither fallen nor been tipped.Our region needs the construction of bridges thatconnect  not walls that separate. Our region needs achannel for the hopes for a promising future  notbarriers that hold the region captive to the past and itstribulations. Our region needs the serious action andsincere cooperation of all in order to dislodge thepolitical peace process from its current impasse and putit back on track.The way out of this bloody dilemma is wellknown. It was laid down by the international Quartet inthe road map that enjoys the support of the entireinternational community. The ultimate destination ofthat path is also well known. It was enunciated byUnited States President George Bush in his vision ofthe establishment of two independent States  Palestineand Israel  living side by side in peace and security.That is the road before us; those are its landmarksand its goals. There is neither time for waiting norroom for foot-dragging. Prompt and effective action isneeded to break the cycle of violence  to restore calmand to resume the process of political negotiations.Such negotiations are the one and only way to end theArab-Israeli conflict.In that regard  Israel’s intended withdrawal fromthe Gaza Strip could be a significant step. If thewithdrawal takes place in a rational  disciplined andorderly manner  it could enable us to begin toovercome the crisis and to put the peace process backon track. However  if it is carried out in an attitude ofstubbornness and short-sightedness  it will lead only totension and further violence.In order to achieve the goal of an Israeliwithdrawal  a number of elements must be ensured. Inparticular  the withdrawal must take place as anintegral and clear part of the road map  and it must befull and complete. The withdrawal must include allcrossing points  the seaport and the airport; otherwise it will be just another way to impose a blockade on andconfinement of the Palestinian people. A completeIsraeli withdrawal means not only the departure ofoccupation forces from the Gaza Strip  but also an endto the policy of incursions  raids and assassinations which must be followed by a withdrawal from all theoccupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank.Despite all the efforts and appeals for peace  thebloodshed continues unabated in the Middle East. Wehad pinned our hopes on the transfer of sovereignty tothe Iraqi people at the end of June and on the formationof an Iraqi Government and National Council. It washoped that those would be the first steps towards therestoration by the Iraqis of their full sovereignty ontheir own national soil and towards ending the foreignpresence in that long-suffering country. However  theevents of recent months and days have shown — andcurrent events continue to show every day — that theIraqi people continue to live in conditions that are farfrom stable.We wonder whose interests are served by theevents in Iraq. Who is to benefit from the destructionof that country  with its age-old civilization? Will the20events taking place in Iraq remain confined to thatcountry  or will they spread beyond its borders likefire  causing destruction and desolation in the region asthey have done in Iraq?We call upon all parties to respect Iraq’ssovereignty and territorial integrity. The people and theState of Iraq desperately need a breathing space forcalm reflection on the best way to bring the country outof the devastating spiral of violence. We call upon theUnited Nations to continue its pivotal role in helpingthe people of Iraq to rebuild their constitutional andlegislative institutions as a first step towards therebuilding of Iraq by the Iraqis themselves.Moreover  there is an urgent humanitarianproblem in Darfur — indeed  a real humanitariantragedy that requires urgent international action tocontain it. But is it inevitable that such an effort takethe form of interference in the Sudan’s internal affairsand violation of its sovereignty? Can we not providehumanitarian assistance and relief to Darfur’sinhabitants without encroaching upon the Sudan’snational sovereignty? Are there enough military forcesin the world to be dispatched as invaders to every areathat is afflicted by a humanitarian crisis?The affairs of the Sudan  with its ethniccomposition and its religious and cultural heritage  areby nature complex. It is our duty to help solve thosecomplex and difficult problems  not to make themmore so.The Sudan has signed  with the United Nations  aframework for cooperation to solve the problem inDarfur and to ensure humanitarian access to thecivilians in the region. That augurs well for the earlyalleviation of this humanitarian tragedy  whichthreatens to have dire consequences for the entireregion. We call upon the international community notto confine itself to criticizing one party or another andnot to lay the blame on one set of policies or another.What is more important and useful is serious action tohelp the Sudanese people to overcome the crisis.Egypt believes that  in order to effectively facethe challenges and threats to international peace andsecurity  we must improve the working methods of theUnited Nations. Therefore  we have participatedseriously — and will continue to do so — in theexercise of strengthening and revitalizing the UnitedNations and its organs. It is our hope that that exercisewill be comprehensive  balanced and transparent andthat it will be carried out in full respect for themandates that established the various organs of theUnited Nations. In that context  we need to reaffirm theneed to revitalize the role of the General Assembly andto ensure respect for and implementation of itsresolutions by establishing an effective follow-upmechanism.I now turn from the wider context of UnitedNations reform to the most sensitive reform issue:reform and expansion of the Security Council. Thesensitivity of that issue clearly stems from theCouncil’s increasing role in international affairs and itseffect on many vital interests and on the internationalbalances of power.Here  I should like clearly to state Egypt’sposition  which is based on our membership in theGroup of African States and the fact that we have thehonour to coordinate the Non-Aligned Movement(NAM) working group on this issue. Egypt hopes thatthe deliberations on this subject will result in bothreform of the Council and expansion of itsmembership. The United Nations and the internationalcommunity as a whole will not gain much if theprocess is limited to expanding the Council’smembership without truly improving its workingmethods so that it can better represent the generalmembership of the Organization and have greatercapacity to maintain international peace and security.Egypt is fully committed to the Declaration of the1997 Harare Summit of the Organization of AfricanUnity (OAU)  which affirmed Africa’s right to twopermanent seats and three non-permanent seats on anexpanded Security Council. We are also committed tothe positions of the Non-Aligned Movement withregard to increasing the membership of the Council toat least 26 member States. Such an expansion could beconfined to the non-permanent category should theexpansion of both membership categories provedifficult.What about the composition of the Council? Wecall for guaranteed representation of all cultures andcivilizations in an expanded Security Council on thebasis of the current geographical distribution in theUnited Nations. We believe that the Council will not beable to effectively carry out its duties in themaintenance of international peace and security unlessit is more aware of the nature and circumstancesprevailing in all societies and of the cultural and21historical heritage on which they base and formulatetheir policies.Here  we must reaffirm the legitimate right ofmore than 1 billion Muslims and more than 300 millionArabs to be represented in the Council on an equalfooting with those who represent other cultures andcivilizations. In that context  I wish to recall thesignificant contributions made by Egypt at the regionaland international levels and its central role in theAfrican  Arab and Islamic spheres. Also noteworthy isEgypt’s role in the Middle East and among developingand emerging economies. As a founding Member of theUnited Nations  Egypt has made well-knowncontributions to the implementation of the purposesand principles of the Organization and to UnitedNations peacekeeping operations. Egypt also played apivotal role in establishing the League of Arab States the OAU  the African Union  NAM and theOrganization of the Islamic Conference. In addition  Iwish to recall that Egypt possesses the components of aregional Power in its comprehensive sense  be iteconomic  military or human. Egypt also enjoys socialand political stability. Its diplomatic outreach is amongthe largest  and over the years it has developed stronginternational ties throughout the world.Egypt has in the past expressed its conviction thatit is eminently qualified to assume the responsibility ofa permanent seat in an expanded Security Council  onthe basis of the Harare Declaration. We reiterate thatthe considerations to which I referred demonstrate thatEgypt is clearly eligible  and has the capacity  to takeon the responsibilities of membership of the SecurityCouncil  in accordance with Article 23 of the Charter.We believe that such membership could be based on asystem of rotation with our African brothers  wherebywe would fill the additional seats that would beallocated to our continent  in accordance with anynewly established status in the Council and with thegeographic distribution as would be worked out by theUnited Nations."
"53",2176,"ERI",59,2004,"Allowme at the outset to join previous speakers incongratulating you  Sir  on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its current session. In lightof the restraints on our time  I shall omit severalacknowledgements and tributes that I should have likedto make and delve directly into matters of vitalimportance to my country  to the region of the Horn ofAfrica and  by extension  to all Member States of ourglobal community.My Government  of course  recognizes and isgrateful for the vital contributions of the internationalcommunity  including the United Nations  to promotepeace in the aftermath of the war that Ethiopia declaredagainst my country  using a place called Badme as apretext for invasion.The Algiers Peace Agreement  signed by the twoparties in December 2000  was drafted and brokered bythe United States  the European Union  the AfricanUnion and Algeria  among others. Furthermore  theinternational community has spent more than $700million to date to maintain the peacekeeping force.More than 37 countries have contributed militarypersonnel  which are involved in UNMEE in variouscapacities. We are indeed grateful for thosecontributions.But  while we applaud those valuablecontributions  we are duty-bound to express  with equalcandour  our regret and dismay at the lack of resoluteaction by the international community at this criticaltime  when the entire process is on the brink ofcollapse. Had the international community respected itsobligations and seen the process through with therequisite seriousness  the border would have beendemarcated long ago. Today could have been anauspicious moment for our peoples to celebrate  fromthis rostrum  the resounding success of the UnitedNations peacekeeping effort. Instead  the dark cloudsof war are once again gathering over my countrybecause of Ethiopia’s intransigence and theacquiescence of major Powers as concerns Ethiopia’sviolations of international law.Allow me to recall some of the most salient tenetsof the Algiers Peace Agreement (A/55/686  annex).First  regarding the establishment and powers ofthe Arbitration Commission  article 4.2 of theAgreement states:“The parties agree that a neutral BoundaryCommission composed of five members shall beestablished with a mandate to delimit anddemarcate the colonial treaty boundary based onpertinent colonial treaties (1900  1902 and 1908)and applicable international law. TheCommission shall not have the power to makedecisions ex aequo et bono.”Secondly  as concerns the final and bindingnature of the decision  article 4.15 states:11“The parties agree that the delimitation anddemarcation determinations of the Commissionshall be final and binding. Each party shallrespect the border so determined  as well as theterritorial integrity and sovereignty of the otherparty.”Thirdly  regarding punitive measures that shouldbe taken against the violating party  paragraph 14 ofthe Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (S/2000/601 annex) states:“[The] OAU and the United Nations committhemselves to guarantee the respect for thiscommitment of the two parties until thedetermination of the common border … Thisguarantee shall be comprised ofa) Measures to be taken by theinternational community should one or bothof the parties violate this commitment including appropriate measures to be takenunder Chapter VII of the Charter of theUnited Nations by the United NationsSecurity Council.”It has been more than two years now since theBoundary Commission announced its decision on thebasis of the Algiers Peace Agreement. That legaldecision was reached after 15 months of litigation following the exchange of numerous memorandumsand a two-week verbal hearing. The decision is finaland binding in accordance with the aforementionedPeace Agreement. Furthermore  the decision is basedon the fundamental African principle of theinviolability of inherited colonial boundaries  whichare not of our making but which we can only respectunless we wish to open the Pandora’s box of an endlesscycle of bloody border conflicts.My Government has accepted in good faith theBoundary Commission’s decision  not because it haswon in the litigation  but because we firmly believethat the only way to secure an enduring peace isthrough respect of the rule of law and the integrity ofthe arbitration decision. That is why my Governmenthas been cooperating  and continues to cooperate  fullyand unreservedly with the Boundary Commission in allits delimitation decisions and demarcation instructions.Ethiopia  on the other hand  has categoricallyrejected the decision of the Boundary Commission. Ina letter to the Security Council on 19 September lastyear  the Ethiopian Prime Minister declared that thework of the Commission was “in terminal crisis”. ThePrime Minister dismissed the decision of the BoundaryCommission as totally illegal  unjust and irresponsible and requested the Security Council to set up analternative mechanism to demarcate the contested partsof the boundary.Ethiopia  of course  has no reason whatsoever toreject the Boundary Commission decision. Apart fromits treaty obligations  the fact is that Ethiopia has won by its own admission  extra territories that neverbelonged to it. Those were the words of the PrimeMinister  the Foreign Minister and the Council ofMinisters on 13 April 2002  when the BoundaryCommission announced its decision.Ethiopia’s belated and calculated rejection of thedecision was an afterthought. It was tentative andcautious at first  but gained boldness and audacitywhen it realized that it could do so with impunity. ThePrime Minister’s letter informing the Security Councilthat Ethiopia totally rejected the decision of theBoundary Commission was written 16 full months afterthe decision was rendered. In a sense  Ethiopia’srejection has more to do with the conduct of theinternational community rather than any intrinsicproblem of the decision itself.Critical and encouraging factors in Ethiopia’srejection were the sympathetic dispositions towards itand the “winks and nods” of certain countries andsome foreign missions in Ethiopia.Ethiopia’s current arguments and excuses on theneed to factor in human and physical geography andbogus concerns as to population dislocation orseparation of villages and homes are so fallacious as tonot even merit discussion. The legal basis fordelimiting the boundary is unequivocal  and Ethiopiacannot inject new elements after the fact. Furthermore boundaries in Africa  and for that matter elsewhere inthe world  are not always carved out of natural riversand ravines to exclude contiguous villages lying oneither side of the boundary between two countries.In the case of the Eritrea-Ethiopia boundary  in1998 Ethiopia expelled 14 500 Eritreans who hadinhabited 39 villages on the eastern part of the Badmeline since the 1920s. Those people have spent the lastseveral years in makeshift camps in western Eritrea.An additional 58 000 Eritreans remain displacedbecause Ethiopia continues to occupy our sovereign12territories. All in all  more than 90 000 Eritreans  andEthiopians of Eritrean origin  were expelled fromEthiopia in 1998 because the Ethiopian Prime Ministerdeclared that “Ethiopia has every right to expel anyforeign citizen if it does not like the colour of theireyes”. How can Ethiopia now invoke the possibledislocation of a few thousand settlers to preventdemarcation of the boundary and jeopardize regionalpeace?In spite of Ethiopia’s violations of the PeaceAgreements  major Powers within the internationalcommunity have not taken critical steps to persuadeEthiopia to uphold the rule of law and abide by itstreaty obligations. On the contrary  Ethiopia iscontinuing to obtain massive humanitarian  economicand military support from major Powers. Full-fledgedeconomic sanctions may not have been necessary  butthe debt cancellation  budgetary support and othersubstantial injections of economic and humanitarianassistance extended to Ethiopia have not been linked toa positive performance in the peace process. As far asEritrea is concerned  therefore  the problem is notEthiopia’s bad-faith conduct in the border dispute  butinternational silence and acquiescence with regard toits violations  which has  in turn  encouraged itsintransigence.It is regrettable that the United NationsSecretariat and some Powers have introduced — andcontinue to dwell on — tangential issues  instead oftaking concrete action to push the peace processforward. Such notions are not only extraneous to theAlgiers Peace Agreement  but  if they were to becomeoperational  would actually subvert and derail thepeace process and significantly contribute to tensionand conflict. Here  I am referring to the related issuesof the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General and the“dialogue” to renegotiate the final and binding decisionof the Boundary Commission.I would like to stress that the appointment of theSpecial Envoy occurred only a few weeks afterEthiopia had formally and officially rejected theBoundary Commission decision requesting the SecurityCouncil to create a new mechanism. While myGovernment did not see any benefit or rationale forthat course of action  it did not reject the proposaloutright. We sought unambiguous clarifications withregard to the mandate and functions of the SpecialEnvoy through various communications  emphasizingthat we could not possibly contemplate renegotiation ofthe decision in any form. Unfortunately  our efforts didnot bear fruit  and the lack of clarity of the responseswe received only reinforced our original suspicions.My Government has therefore informed the Secretary-General that it considers that the issue of the SpecialEnvoy — which has eclipsed the key issue for almost ayear now — to be a closed chapter and appealed to theSecretary-General to refocus international attention onEthiopia’s violations of the Algiers Peace Agreementand the rule of law.In the same vein  the issue of bilateral dialoguewith Ethiopia should be viewed and can be understoodonly in its proper perspective. Eritrea has no problemwith the idea of fully normalizing its relations withEthiopia and reviving good-neighbourly relations. Weare neighbours  destined to live together and inharmony. But we cannot possibly put the cart beforethe horse and discuss economic or security issues  orother issues relating to cooperation  while Ethiopia isforcibly occupying our land in blatant breach of theAlgiers Peace Agreement and the decision of theBoundary Commission. Indeed  Eritrea will not needthe good offices of an intermediary in order to resumenormal bilateral ties with Ethiopia once the criticalborder issue is resolved legally and peacefully. I muststress that the border issue cannot be the subject ofsterile dialogue such as that sought by Ethiopia. That islegally untenable and practically impossible.The cost of inaction by the internationalcommunity to regional peace and stability will beenormous  and my Government sincerely hopes that theindifference that we have witnessed over the past twoyears will be rectified in time. Eritrea has shownmaximum patience and restraint  even though itssovereign territories remain occupied by force. Butpatience has a limit — particularly given that thehumanitarian burden is of great importance and that thesituation in that regard has been unsustainable for along time. Indeed  over 60 000 of our citizens continueto live in makeshift camps  unable to return to theirhome villages.In his address to the General Assembly on21 September 2004  the Secretary-General made apassionate appeal for respect for the rule of law athome and abroad. The people and the Government ofEritrea would like to thank him for that statement which they subscribe to in its entirety and endorsewithout reservation. Eritreans continue to be victims ofthe violation of the rule of law as a result of Ethiopia’s13rejection  with impunity  of the final and bindingdecision of an arbitration commission sanctioned bythe United Nations and other organizations  as well asby other States.Eritreans also fully agree that the rule of lawbegins at home  including at the United Nations. Itmust not be forgotten that the implementation of theCommission’s decision was guaranteed by a treatyobligation signed by the Secretary-General on behalf ofthe United Nations. It is therefore essential to note thatany stalemate in the demarcation process is a stalematenot between Eritrea  which has accepted the decisionwithout any reservations or conditions  and Ethiopia which has rejected it  but between Ethiopia and theUnited Nations  which has guaranteed implementationand provided for punitive action  under Chapter VII ofthe Charter  against the party that refuses to implementthe Commission’s decision.The United Nations has the duty of enforcing therule of law. This is a violation of the rule of law anddemonstrates the collective failure of the UnitedNations to uphold the law and to instil respect for it inour fellow men and women. Ethiopia cannot be abovethe law; Eritrea should not be denied its protection  andthe United Nations must employ its enforcementcapacity for the rule of law by fulfilling its treatyobligations.Before concluding  I would like to outline brieflythe views of my Government on other regionalproblems. My Government warmly welcomes theprogress made over the past few months in promotingreconciliation and lasting peace in Somalia. Althoughwe are handicapped by the war imposed on us byEthiopia  we have nonetheless continued to makemodest contributions to a durable and peacefulresolution of Somalia’s internal problem. Our approachhas always hinged on supporting the Somalis as theytry to find their own solutions and on preventing thefragmentation and Balkanization of Somalia  whichhave been driven by external  rather than internal tendencies.The magnitude of the humanitarian crisis in theSudan is too well known to merit explanation here. Butas the international community focuses on what iscurrently taking place in Darfur  what is often missedis the larger picture of regional destabilization andincalculable human suffering that the fundamentalistextremist regime has been fomenting for almost15 years. Furthermore  the ramifications of theNational Islamic Front’s policies  which are based onextremist ideology  have not been confined to theSudan but have affected several neighbouringcountries  including my country. It is thereforeessential that major Powers in the internationalcommunity see the problem for what it is and assess iton the basis of what it portends.In conclusion  I would like to restate the positionof my Government on the relevant ongoing debateabout the reform of the United Nations system. It isclear to us  as a matter that has been reinforced by ourrecent experience  that  despite many achievements there are areas of critical shortfall that require reformand restructuring. We also believe that parameters andconsiderations that were relevant when the UnitedNations was established in the immediate aftermath ofthe Second World War need to be revisited andadjusted  in accordance with contemporary realities.Furthermore  representation in the Security Councilmust satisfy the criteria of reasonable regionalrepresentation and equity  as well as of the equality ofsovereign nations  as enshrined in the Charter."
"54",2222,"ESP",59,2004,"This isthe first occasion on which I have addressed theGeneral Assembly on behalf of my country; I am verypleased to do so. My country is an old country - adiverse country  with several languages and varioustraditions and cultures. Our country is European Mediterranean and Ibero-American in character.I am speaking on behalf of a country that has hadits share of difficult experiences throughout history. Itis a country in which some people who are alive todayhave known a civil war  a dictatorship that lasted foralmost four decades and a democracy that is now 25years old and that has brought great progress. We havealso known the scourge of terrorism for more than 30years ó terrorism that has taken so many lives.Over the past 30 years  Spanish men and womenhave learned a great deal about terrorism. We learnedearly on how evil it is. We became familiar with it. Welearned how to defy it and how to withstand its blowswith courage and dignity. We have learned how to fightit. Precisely because they have experienced it for 30years that the citizens of my country felt deeply thepain of the American people on 11 September 2001.We knew how they felt; we know how they feel. Herein New York  I would like to convey the heartfeltsolidarity of the people of Spain with the great nationof the United States.We fully understand the terrible pain that inrecent years has been inflicted upon Jakarta  Bali Casablanca  Riyadh and Beslanq. We know all aboutkidnappings  bombings and cold-blooded killings. Weknow what compassion means.On 11 March this year  a terrorist attack inMadrid took the lives of 192 people. We had neverexperienced that kind of terrorism before  but we werefamiliar with the bloodshed and the pain that it caused.I would like  from this rostrum  to express my deepappreciation to all nations for their solidarity with ourcountry when we were suffering so deeply after thebrutal attack in Madrid.Spanish men and women were not afraid. On theday after the bombings  millions of people left theirhomes and took to the streets and squares of our citiesand towns. Once again  we expressed ourcondemnation  disgust and total contempt for terroristbrutality.Thirty years of resisting terrorism has taught usthat the risk of a terrorist victory rises sharply when  inorder to fight terror  democracy betrays its fundamentalnature  when Governments curtail civil liberties  putjudicial guaranties at risk or carry out pre-emptivemilitary operations. This is what my people havelearned: it is the rule of law  democracy and politicalmethods that make us stronger and make them weaker.We will resist terrorism. Our history endorses ourresolve. We will pursue our fight against terrorism  butwe will do so respecting domestic and internationallaw; we will do so with respect for human rights andfor the United Nations ó and in no other way. It is notonly the ethics of our beliefs that move us. It is aboveall our belief in ethics. Our conviction is thatlegality - only legality ó will enable us to prevail inthe fight against terrorism.Nothing justifies terrorism. Like the plague  it hasno justification. But like the plague  it has roots thatcan and must be uncovered. We can and must rationallyanalyse how it emerges and how it grows  so that wecan fight it rationally.Terrorism is insanity and death  and regrettablythere will always be fanatics who are ready to kill toimpose their insanity through force  ready to scatter theseed of evil. The seed of evil cannot take root when itfalls on the rock of justice  well-being  freedom andhope  but it can take root if it lands on the soil ofinjustice  poverty  humiliation and despair.Redressing the major political and economicinjustices that devastate our world would thereforedeprive terrorists of their popular support. The morepeople there are who have decent living conditionsaround the world  the safer we will all be.35In this context  I would like to speak about Iraq.But first of all I would like to speak about thethousands of victims of this conflict: the Iraqis  thesoldiers  the civilians who have lost their lives. Weextend to them and to their countries our steadysolidarity.The overwhelming majority of people in Spainspoke out against the war. We were not persuaded bythe arguments offered by those who promoted the war.We expressed our views in the Spanish Parliament andin the streets. We spoke out loudly  we shouted. Wealso said that winning the war would be much easierthan winning the peace. Peace must be our task - atask that requires more courage  more determinationand more heroism than the war. That is why theSpanish troops returned from Iraq.In any event  what really matters now is to helpfully restore the sovereignty and independence ofIraq - a democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbours.We will spare no effort in that task. And so Spainactively participated in the drafting of Security Councilresolution 1546 (2004) and will continue to offerpolitical and financial support for the process ofpolitical normalization and strengthening Iraqidemocratic institutions.There will be neither security nor stability in theworld as long as the Middle East conflict continues tobleed. That conflict is the primary tumour for manysources of instability.Spain firmly supports resolutions adopted by theUnited Nations  and other instruments such as theQuartet's road map  which is yet to be implemented.The time we are wasting is to be measured in terms ofhuman lives.Spain stands by Israel against the terrible scourgeof terrorism  against which it is entitled to defend itselfby legitimate means. Spain firmly defends theestablishment of a viable  democratic Palestinian Statethat can live in peace and security with the State ofIsrael. Israel will be able to count on the internationalcommunity to the extent that it respects internationallaw  but the placement of the dividing wall fails to dothat.Spain will spare no political  diplomatic orcooperation effort to try and bring about the peace thatis so needed in the Middle East. But from this rostrum we would also like to extend an urgent appeal to theUnited States  the European Union  Russia and theUnited Nations to implement the road map. Those arefour powerful players indeed  and we want to see themexerting decisive diplomatic pressure.In the humanitarian field  Spain has contributedseveral million euros to help alleviate the terrible crisisin Darfur. However  the Sudanese authorities must without delay  take all measures necessary to end theatrocities  bring the perpetrators to justice andnormalize the situation in the region. It is alsonecessary for the rebel groups and militias to respectthe ceasefire and show a constructive attitude at thenegotiating table. In this context  we must support theinitiatives of the African Union.Spain believes we can no longer passively acceptthe continuation of Africa's forgotten conflicts  andthat is why  with partners in the European Union  wesupported the establishment of the African PeaceFacility  an instrument designed to promote regionalsolutions to crises in Africa.In the Maghreb  Spain is pursuing an active andcomprehensive policy to enhance political stability andeconomic and social development in the region.Regional integration and interdependence with Spainand Europe is  we believe  the way to reach thosegoals.With regard to Western Sahara  Spain stronglysupports the search for a just and definitive politicalsolution that is accepted by all parties and respects theprinciples set forth in the resolutions of the UnitedNations. From this rostrum I appeal to all the partiesinvolved to redouble their efforts  within theframework of dialogue and negotiations established bythe United Nations  to resolve a conflict that hasdragged on for far too long.May I confirm Spain's commitment topeacekeeping operations - a fundamental part ofeffective multilateralism that we are seeking toencourage. Our political commitment is reflected inspecific contributions in the form of militarycontingents for Afghanistan and Haiti  in accordancewith explicit Security Council mandates.Peace and security will spread through the worldonly with the strength of the United Nations  thestrength of international legality  the strength of humanrights  of democracy  of men abiding by the law  withequality of men and women  with equality of36opportunities  no matter where people are born. Wereject those who would manipulate us or wish toimpose any kind of religion or belief. The strength ofeducation and culture is essential  for culture is alwayspeace. Let us ensure that our perception of others iscoloured by respect. There must be dialogue amongpeoples.Thus  as a representative of a country created andenriched by divers cultures  in this Assembly I want topropose an alliance of civilizations between theWestern and the Arab and Muslim worlds. Some yearsago a wall fell. We must now prevent hatred and a lackof understanding from building another wall. Spainproposes to the Secretary-General - whose work atthe head of this organization we firmly support ó thepossibility of establishing a high-level group to moveahead with this initiative.This is the house of nations  but I see onlywomen and men. I hear only the voices of women andmen who represent billions of other women and men.Many of these voices - many feeble and barelyaudible  the voices of children  the weak  thehopeless - come from lands devastated by povertyand inequality.It is they whom I now want to address to declarethat Spain strongly supports the MillenniumDeclaration Goals with respect to development poverty eradication and the preservation of theenvironment. Poverty is the main cause of uncontrolledmigration flows. But no wall  no matter how tall  canprevent those who suffer from trying to escape povertyin order to recover their dignity as human beings.For those reasons  we are firmly committed to thepolitical declaration we adopted yesterday within theframework of the International Alliance AgainstHunger - promoted by President Lula da Silva -which establishes new ways to fund development. TheGovernment of Spain will substantially increase itsofficial development assistance in order to reach thethreshold of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product.In order for there to be peace  security and hopeall over the world  international instruments for thepromotion and protection of human rights need to bestrengthened and effectively implemented. That is oneof the basic pillars of our foreign policy. Our objectivesare the signing and ratification of the Optional Protocolto the Convention against Torture  the universalabolition of the death penalty  the effort to enddiscrimination against women  gender-based violenceand discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation the protection of children and the combating of childabuse and exploitation  and the strict observance ofhuman rights in the fight against terrorism and crime.World peace and security require respect forlegality. Therefore  Spain wishes to promote theeffective functioning of the International CriminalCourt. To that end  I call upon all States that have yetdone so to ratify the Statute of the Court fully unconditionally and without delay and thus help us inour common endeavour to build a world that is morejust.My Government wholeheartedly supports theUnited Nations reform process set out in theMillennium Declaration and endorses the Secretary-Generalís initiatives for the reform and institutionalstrengthening of the Organization. Spain believes thatit is essential for the future of the international orderthat the reform be aimed at ensuring effectivecompliance with United Nations resolutions  inparticular those of the Security Council.The Security Council must be made morerepresentative  democratic  effective and transparent.To that end  Spain is willing to consider new proposalsfor achieving consensus on increasing the number ofnon-permanent members and on the use of the vetopower.I want to reaffirm Spain's commitment to the justcauses of the Latin American peoples and toconsolidating democratic systems and political stabilityin the region. I reaffirm our support for economicprogress aimed at reducing inequality andstrengthening social cohesion. Within the EuropeanUnion  we will continue to promote a closerrelationship with that region through the developmentof a strategic partnership between both sides of theAtlantic.I would not wish to conclude my statementwithout referring to the question of Gibraltar. Everyyear  the General Assembly reiterates its calls to Spainand the United Kingdom to pursue bilateralnegotiations in order to reach a definitive solution tothe dispute. I affirm that my country will continue itswillingness to negotiate a solution that benefits the37region as a whole and heeds the wishes of that non-autonomous territory.The United Nations was born of necessity andideals. It was built by women and men who affirmedtheir faith in understanding among peoples andcultures. They left us a legacy of utopia. They thoughtthat everything was within their reach: the settlementof old conflicts  the eradication of poverty  rights forall human beings. Today we could ask ourselves  whatis within our reach?Almost everything is. It is true that the history ofhumankind does not give us many reasons to beoptimistic. Nor does the world today offer us manyreasons to feel superior to the men that preceded us.One out of three countries in the world does not have afree system. Torture continues to exist. There are morethan 30 armed conflicts around the world today. Half ofthe war victims are children. Millions of people aresuffering from AIDS. One billion human beings subsiston a dollar a day. More than 800 million adults areilliterate. More than 150 million children are withoutaccess to any kind of education. More than 1 billionpeople lack safe drinking water. No  we human beingscannot feel very proud of ourselves.We must fight to overcome this situation. We  theSpanish women and men of today  are resolved to makeit possible for the women and men who come after usto be able to say: yes  they did do it."
"55",2248,"EST",59,2004,"First of all  allow meto congratulate you on your election to the office of thePresident of the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. I wish you every success and all the best inyour very important work. I would also like to thankyour predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  for his leadershipof the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session.The current session is very significant forEstonia  since it is the first time ever that weparticipate at the General Assembly as a member Stateof the European Union and the NATO. We aretherefore more aware than ever before of our sharedresponsibility for the world  but also of ourvulnerability to global threats.During the last few years  we have all witnessednew threats to world peace and security. We have alsoseen how these threats are all connected to economic social  cultural and humanitarian problems. The fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly focused on thesituation in Iraq. However  securing peace and stabilityin the Middle East remains an ongoing concern. I hopethat all of this has only deepened our conviction thatthe goals and principles of the United Nations Charterhave not really lost their topicality but rather  are evenmore topical now. In today’s world of new threats andchanging global security  we need shared solutionsmore than ever before. The United Nations is the onlyorganization established to coordinate  on a globalscale  the efforts of States in safeguarding internationalstability and security. The United Nations has to beeven more decisive and efficient in order tosuccessfully fulfil its important responsibilities in thisnew situation.The reduction of world poverty continues to be acentral issue on the global development agenda; lesspoverty would certainly mean more internationalstability and security. The international community hasmade a commitment to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals by the year 2015  halving povertyin the world by that time. That is a very optimisticpromise indeed  and it assumes that all countries mustperform even more purposefully and in an even morecoordinated manner. High-level meetings in Doha Monterrey and Johannesburg have shown us the way;now  we must act.At the forthcoming 2005 summit  we will reviewour progress in fulfilling the goals set out in theMillennium Declaration. I would like to appeal to all of25us here to work so that we would be content with theconclusions in the interim report.Together with other United Nations MemberStates  Estonia shares responsibility for balanceddevelopment in the world and makes its contributiontowards achieving the common goals. Only recently we were one of the recipient countries of internationalaid. Now that we are one of the donors  we are verymuch aware of how important it is that internationalaid be coordinated and harmonized. We beganproviding international aid in 1998. Time has shownthat the Estonian experience in building up democraticinstitutions  implementing economic reforms andinvolving civil society in public life and decision-making can really help other countries where suchprocesses are still in their initial stage.Despite the work that has already been done toachieve the very challenging Millennium DevelopmentGoals  we must admit  unfortunately  that the gapbetween the rich and the poor is widening. What ismore  it is taking new forms in our changing world. Inaddition to economic inequality  the information erahas brought about the so-called digital divide  a dividebetween information-rich and information-poor Statesand nations as well as social groups. I would like tobriefly elaborate on this topic.In spite of the rapid development in informationtechnology over the last ten years  only a small groupof privileged countries and social groups havebenefited from the so-called digital revolution. Forexample  let us consider access to the Internet. Many ofus cannot really imagine life without the Internet  butfour-fifths of the world population have never had anycontact with the Internet. More than a half of Internetusers live in Europe or in North America  whichtogether represent only 17 per cent of the world’spopulation. In Africa  only 1.4 per cent of thepopulation uses the Internet.The digital divide exists not only betweencountries but also within countries  between differentsocial groups. The causes of such a divide can be age gender  language  education or income. The digitaldivide is a reflection of technological  social andeconomic backwardness  perhaps due to a lack ofinfrastructure or to that infrastructure being veryexpensive. At the same time  the digital divide is notonly an expression of existing socio-economicinequality  but also amplifies it and even causes it.Today  the social and economic value of access toinformation is much higher than it was 20 years ago.Unequal access to know-how  information networksand opportunities to contribute to these networks  will in the longer term  lead to a further marginalization ofpoor countries and poor social groups. Paradoxically the very same Internet is behind this marginalization although it is supposed to be the cheapest and mostefficient way to exchange information and knowledgein the world.Since information technology has a strong impacton economic growth and competitiveness  there is nodoubt that it is a new factor in development policy.That is why in recent years  more and more attentionhas focused on the causes and consequences of thedigital divide. For example  the United NationsDevelopment Programme’s Human DevelopmentReport 2001 concentrated on those problems and wasthe centre of attention at the 2003 World Summit onthe Information Society in Geneva.I am very pleased that Estonia has  in a relativelyshort period of time  achieved a remarkable level inseveral areas of information technology. We havemanaged to create a favourable environment fordevelopment in this field and have ensured that thenecessary infrastructure has been created through closecooperation between the public sector and the privatesector  businesses and non-governmental organizations.As a result of this  Estonian citizens of limited meansnow have access to several information societyservices. According to “The Economist”  as of 2004 Estonia ranks 26th in the world in e-readiness andholds a leading position among Central and EasternEuropean countries. More than half the Estonianpopulation regularly uses the Internet; 38 per cent owncomputers; 80 per cent own mobile phones; 62 per centuse Internet banking; and 59 per cent fill out their taxreturns electronically. Estonians can communicate withboth the central Government and local governmentsover the Internet and are able to use legally bindingdigital signatures. All those indicators are in line withEuropean Union averages even though Estonia’s grossdomestic product remains considerably lower than theEuropean average.I believe that  as a former country in transition Estonia has experiences which could be very useful fordeveloping countries with respect to the promotion ofinformation and communication technologies. Estoniais in a position to provide development assistance  first26and foremost in the form of know-how. We havealready taken steps in that direction: in the summer of2002 the Government of Estonia  the United NationsDevelopment Programme and the InformationProgramme of the Open Society Institute jointly set upthe Estonian e-Governance Academy. The purpose ofthat unique Academy is to improve the public-privatecooperation in the information and communicationtechnologies. The initial beneficiaries of the project areCentral and Eastern European countries  countries ofthe Commonwealth of Independent States and Asiancountries  but we already have future plans for Africancountries as well. The e-Governance Academy hasalready held training courses for officials fromKyrgyzstan  Sri Lanka  Albania  Kazakhstan and othercountries.The year 2004 is the final year of theInternational Decade of the World’s Indigenous People.I am an Estonian  and as an Estonian I have a specificreason to talk about indigenous peoples: we are anation that knows how important it is to preserve anddevelop our culture and language. Therefore  I am veryhappy that recent decades have seen increasedmomentum in the activities of the United Nations andits agencies to protect the rights of indigenous peoples.But the approaching end of the InternationalDecade of the World’s Indigenous People must notmean diminished attention to the situation ofindigenous peoples. The rights of indigenous peoplesmust be codified in international law without furtherdelay. Estonia firmly supports the speedy formulationand adoption of a declaration on the rights ofindigenous peoples. Regardless of the progress that hasbeen made locally  many of the world’s peoples remainuncertain about the preservation of their cultures andlanguages. Restrictions on the rights of indigenouspeoples are one of the reasons behind the emergence ofhot spots and crises.Scientists enter endangered species into a RedBook in order to help save them from extinction. Butwe do not yet have a Red Book of peoples. When aspecies of wildlife disappears  nature becomes poorerand the ecological balance can be damaged. By thesame token  the extinction of a people means that thewhole world becomes intellectually and culturallypoorer.Anthropologists have used the concept of the“fourth world” to refer to the ever increasingmarginalization of indigenous peoples and thedeterioration of their living conditions. The livingconditions of Finno-Ugric peoples in their historichomelands provide a worrying example. The Councilof Europe Parliamentary Assembly has expressed itsconcerns in that respect. In August this year  the fourthWorld Congress of the Finno-Ugric Peoples took placein Estonia under the motto “Youth is our future.” Thefinal document of the Congress expressed concernabout the ongoing loss of national identity by Finno-Ugric peoples and called on the internationalcommunity to devote greater attention to the protectionof human rights and the rights of indigenous peoplesand national minorities.I would like finally to touch upon the future ofthe United Nations. The United Nations needs to bestrengthened and improved: it needs to be reorganizedso that it can better respond to new challenges.Reorganization and increased efficiency would makethe Organization more reliable and provide it withgreater authority. Here  all Member States share acommon goal: to ensure the steady development of theUnited Nations and to effect reforms that wouldenhance its effectiveness as a multilateral organization.Estonia firmly supports that process.I believe that greater attention should be devotedto the prevention of crises and conflicts. We await thepublication on 1 December of the report of the High-Level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change  whichcould provide essential guidelines for making theUnited Nations function more efficiently in thechanged global framework.Thanks to the efforts of Secretary-General KofiAnnan and the President of the fifty-eighth session Julian Hunte  and thanks to the cooperation of MemberStates  discussions on revitalization of the work of theGeneral Assembly have yielded concrete and desirableresults  reflected in resolution 58/316  adopted on1 July. That resolution is an essential landmark in theprocess of changing and modernizing the GeneralAssembly to keep pace with developments in worldevents. At the fifty-ninth session  under the presidencyof Mr. Jean Ping  we must continue and intensify ourefforts in that direction.Finally  it is also high time that we movedforward with reform of the Security Council  which27would enable the United Nations to participate moreeffectively in resolving world problems and crises."
"56",2294,"ETH",59,2004,"Allow me to extend toyou warm congratulations on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Iwould like to assure you of our fullest cooperation asyou discharge the heavy responsibility bestowed uponyou. I have no doubt that both Gabon and Africa willbe proud of the leadership that I know you will provideat this session.I would also like to commend your predecessorfor his invaluable contribution to the success of thefifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.We continue to be deeply grateful to theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the great workthat he has been doing in a variety of areas and atvarious levels. We are grateful to him for doingwhatever is humanly possible at the international levelto protect the integrity of the United Nations and todefend the rule of law. At the level of Africa  weappreciate his commitment to the creation of thepolitical and economic conditions to generate hope forthe revival of the continent.Never before have we in Africa been asdetermined and as resolute in our attempt to change forthe better the economic and social conditions on ourcontinent and to create the right climate for peace andstability.That is what the transformation of theOrganization of African Unity into the African Union(AU) signifies and what the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) symbolizes. NEPAD’sPeer Review Mechanism is a vivid demonstration ofAfrica’s commitment to good and accountablegovernance.The renewed vigour with which we in Africahave begun to be proactive in the area of peace andstability within the framework of the Peace andSecurity Council of the AU is  indeed  a promisingbeginning. But despite the efforts being made byAfrica  the progress that we have made so far has beenmodest and thus insufficient to bring about hope for thefuture of the continent.Part of the explanation for that is obvious. Thereis just not sufficient support internationally to make itpossible for Africa to meet the economic challengesthat it is facing. Terms of trade have continued tomilitate against Africa’s development. Moreover  nosubstantial progress has been made to relieve many inAfrica of the debt burden.It is the combination of all of those factors thathas created serious doubts about the ability of many inAfrica to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.It is our hope that those trends will be reversed and thatthe promises made in the Millennium Declarationfulfilled.At the end of the day  nations must assumeresponsibility for their future  for their developmentand for their peace and stability. Ethiopia has noillusions in that regard. We realize fully that  in thefinal analysis  it is what Ethiopians do that will shapeand determine our future. It is that conviction that isthe basis for the various activities currently under wayin our country.With respect to issues of development  theprimary task for us is the fight against poverty andensuring food security for our people. A nation asdiverse as Ethiopia can countenance no other form ofgovernance than democratic governance. As such  thevery survival of Ethiopia requires good governance andthe democratic handling of differences  as a matter notonly of preference but of prudence. Peace and stability19in Ethiopia hinge on the deepening of democracy in thecountry.It is precisely for that reason  and with a view tomaking up for lost time  that at present there is nogreater imperative for Ethiopia than the fostering ofpeace and stability in our country and in the region ofwhich Ethiopia is a part.It is that same logic which governs Ethiopia’sposition on the peace process between Ethiopia andEritrea. Let there be no doubt that Ethiopia wants toput its crisis with Eritrea behind it. Our conviction isthat both peoples would be mistaken to see the other asan enemy. The truth is that both have one commonenemy — poverty and backwardness.It is  indeed  regrettable that after so muchbloodshed it has become difficult for Ethiopia andEritrea to formally complete the peace process becauseof complications that have been created in connectionwith the implementation of some aspects of thedecision of the Eritrea/Ethiopia Boundary Commission(EEBC). I said  “some aspects of the decision” of theEEBC because  when the chips are down  the obstaclesto a breakthrough in the peace process betweenEthiopia and Eritrea involve a controversy surroundingthe demarcation of no more than 15 per cent of acommon boundary which is  altogether  more than1 000 kilometres long.Let me be very clear. Ethiopia is prepared to dowhatever is humanly possible for peace. There is nogreater priority for us than ensuring peace in ourcountry and stable and mutually beneficial relationswith all our neighbours. That is precisely why we havereiterated that we are ready to dialogue with Eritreawith a view to finding a win-win solution to the currentstalemate faced by both countries.Dialogue and normalization of relations betweenthe two countries is not a favour that either party doesfor the other  or for the international community.Rather  it is an obligation that both countries have inasmuch as all other alternatives are ruled out byinternational law and by the Algiers Agreement.The promotion of durable peace between the twocountries and the call for the permanent cessation ofmilitary hostilities between the two parties are the twinpillars of the Algiers Agreement. Ethiopia is convincedthat the implementation of some aspects of theBoundary Commission’s observations on demarcationis not in the interest of peace between the two countriesand will not advance the major objectives of theAlgiers Agreement  nor will it advance the cause ofpeace in our subregion.It is under those circumstances that Ethiopia hasfelt that there is only one rational way out of theimpasse — dialogue  an open-ended dialogue on allissues dividing Ethiopia and Eritrea  including onboundary demarcation with a view to finding anamicable and a mutually acceptable way out of thedeadlock and a modus vivendi that would form thebasis for the normalization of relations between thetwo countries.Eritrea  however  is of a different mind. Itcontinues to be preoccupied with the hope of gettingthe Security Council to impose sanctions on Ethiopiaand with the satisfaction that it would derive from suchan outcome. Eritrea should be made to realize that thatis unlikely to happen. Not because Eritrea is not bigenough to have its way  but because the idea is tooinappropriate and too unrealistic. Formality aside —and Eritrea’s oft-heard refrain of “final and binding”notwithstanding — no fair-minded person can forgetwhat happened in May 1998 and up through May 2000 and what the OAU said about Badme and its environs.But talking about the past is not going to helpEthiopia or Eritrea. The two countries cannot continuespending so much time on their preoccupation witheach other. That will leave no time for thinking abouttheir future and the future of their hungry and destitutepeoples.There is one other important point that Eritreashould not be allowed to continue misleading theinternational community about. Nowhere in the wholetext of the Algiers Agreement of December 2000 is aprovision made for any entity — including the SecurityCouncil and the AU — to enforce a court decision.That omission is deliberate  not accidental. Achievingpeace and implementing the demarcation of thecommon boundary between the two countries isprimarily the responsibility of Ethiopia and Eritrea  apoint that has been repeated in various resolutions bythe Security Council.Let me close the issue by reiterating onefundamental point. Ethiopia is committed to peace withEritrea and to the removal of obstacles to achievingthat objective. Whatever means might be available toreach that goal  we will be ready to embrace them.20Dialogue and negotiation  including using the goodoffices of the Secretary-General which have been madeavailable to the two parties  are the most realistic andfeasible means for making progress in the peaceprocess. Ethiopia is ready to go more than half way tomake that a reality  but so far it has largely been left inthe proverbial situation of trying to clap with one hand.It is our hope that reason will prevail in Eritrea soonerrather than later.The peace process in Somalia has now come to avery critical point  with the Somalis having now comecloser than any time in the last 13 years to establishinga national Government. Ethiopia will continue  as amember of the Intergovernmental Authority onDevelopment Facilitation Committee  to contribute tothe achievement of national reconciliation and work tohelp the Somali State rise from the ashes. That is anobligation for Ethiopia and it is also consistent with thevital interest Ethiopia has in peace and stability in oursubregion.For those reasons  Ethiopia was looking forwardto the final consummation of the peace processbetween the Government of the Sudan and theSudanese People’s Liberation Movement/SudanesePeople’s Liberation Army (SPLM/SPLA)  which hasnow slowed down because of the tragedy in Darfur —an unanticipated tragedy. Ethiopia is keen to see theDarfur crisis resolved and the humanitarian tragedydealt with as speedily as possible. Peace and stabilityin the Sudan is so critical for our subregion and for thatreason Ethiopia will continue to do the best it can including as a member of the AU Peace and SecurityCouncil  to assist that sister country to overcome thechallenge it is facing.Ethiopia’s contribution to peace and peace-building is not limited to what we have been doing inour own subregion. We have from the outset beenclosely associated with the prevention  managementand resolution of conflicts in the Great Lakes region including at the highest level. Moreover  initially aspart of the African Union mission and later as part ofthe United Nations Operation in Burundi  Ethiopia’scontingent in Burundi has continued to contribute in amodest way to the success of the peace process there.Another modest contribution we are making is injoining the efforts under way for the restoration ofpeace in Liberia as part of the United Nations Missionin Liberia.Certainly  we are also the beneficiaries of thesupport of a great many countries through the UnitedNations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) whose work has been critical for keeping the situationbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea stable. We are indeedgrateful to UNMEE  its personnel at all levels  and tothe troop-contributing countries.We all agree that terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations is a crime against humanity. As ourSecretary-General rightly stated in his address to thisAssembly at the 3rd meeting  “No cause  no grievance however legitimate in itself  can begin to justify suchacts”. The international community should thereforefight that scourge with greater resolve and in unison.I would like to conclude by reaffirmingEthiopia’s commitment to the United Nations and tothe principles and purposes for the promotion of whichit was created. It is our earnest hope that the UnitedNations will continue to enhance its credibility withrespect to its entire membership. That is why thereform of the Organization is so critical andimperative  including the reform of the SecurityCouncil  so that regions  including Africa  can have thefair representation they aspire to. Without a doubt enhanced democratization will make the UnitedNations more transparent and therefore more credible.The future of the Organization rests on it. In themeantime  Ethiopia will continue to be devoted to theUnited Nations and to the values it stands for."
"57",2340,"FIN",59,2004,"In today's globalized world  security and prosperity areinseparable. There can be no lasting peace in any partof the world when millions of people suffer every dayfrom deprivation  poverty  armed conflicts andterrorism. There is no human dignity when even themost basic human rights of millions of people areviolated every day. There is no equality as long asthere is discrimination because of gender  race orbeliefs. There is no fairness when international anddomestic rules favour the rich and powerful andoppress the poor and weak.We  the family of nations  cannot remain on thesidelines. We need multilateral tools to meet thechallenges of a globalized world. We must develop andenhance our multilateral institutions. This appliesespecially to the United Nations  whose position inpromoting peace and development is unique.Member States have given the Security Councilthe primary responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. The members of theSecurity Council ó and especially its permanentmembers ó must display a common will andcompromise on narrowly defined national interests.The other nations must then show support for theSecurity Councilís position and its decisions.Before the war in Iraq  however  the internationalcommunity failed. Conflicting national interestsprevailed over common will. There was not enoughcommitment to act within the boundaries of SecurityCouncil resolutions. Some nations resorted to the useof force  which was not in accordance withinternational law.But now we must turn our eyes and energies tothe future. We need to restore security and stability inIraq so that the building of democracy and prosperitycan begin in earnest. Finland is participating in thetraining of Iraqi police forces and we have decided tocontribute Ä1 million for security for staff members ofthe United Nations system working in Iraq.There is no sustainable alternative tomultilateralism. The international community mustrecognize its collective responsibility. We must be ableto intervene and prevent situations in which humanrights are seriously violated.We cannot afford to let the Darfur situation getout of hand. The United Nations and the internationalcommunity must be able to act in time  effectively andas long as needed. I thank the Secretary-General for hispromise of action today.Globalization could and should be a force for abrighter future for all people. However  globalizationas we experience it today falls far short of this promiseand is ethically and politically unsustainable. Toimplement the Millennium Declaration  we need tomake globalization more fair and attentive to peopleísneeds and aspirations. This requires more coherence closer and better international cooperation and strongerdemocratic States that work for fairness at home andabroad.We must act without delay in order to achieve theMillennium Development Goals. We have agreed onadditional resources  we have agreed on localownership and we have agreed on good governance.Let us deliver on these promises. The poor of the worldcannot wait. We must make the 0.7 per cent target ondevelopment assistance a reality. We need to giveopen-minded consideration to new and innovative4proposals for additional development funding including international taxation.One concrete indication of the desire toimplement the Millennium Declaration is the WorldCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalization.The Commission has drafted numerousrecommendations which the United Nations systemshould study before the review of the MillenniumDeclaration next autumn. Tanzania and Finland willpresent an initiative for this session of the GeneralAssembly to deal with the Commissionísrecommendations in the United Nations.The United Nations has a key role today andtomorrow in promoting peace  security  economicprosperity  social welfare  human rights and the rule oflaw. Finland gives full support to the broad reform ofthe United Nations that is now underway. The time isripe for a reform of the Security Council and theexpansion of its membership so that it bettercorresponds to todayís world. We also need to vitalizethe General Assembly and give the Economic andSocial Council the role envisaged in the UnitedNations Charter.I hope that when we meet here at United NationsHeadquarters a year from now  we can proudly notethat we have taken concrete steps towards a betterworld. This is a responsibility that all of us share and Iknow it requires a lot of work from all of us  but  dearcolleagues  let us do it."
"58",2384,"FJI",59,2004,"I would like to extend to theGeneral Assembly the warm greetings and good wishesof the Government and people of the Republic of theFiji Islands. I would also like to warmly congratulateyou  Mr. President  on your election to the presidencyof the fifty-ninth session. I pledge to you our supportand cooperation. That reflects our respect for yourcountry  with which we have enjoyed close relationsthrough our common membership of the African Caribbean and Pacific partnership with the EuropeanUnion. I also wish to express Fiji’s warm thanks toMr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia for his very ableleadership of the fifty-eighth session. Fiji and othersmall island nations of the Pacific region applaud thefine example set by the countries of the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) in their shared approach tomanaging the responsibilities of that high office.Today we are confronted by events that cast ashadow over humankind and the United Nations visionof peace. The humanitarian crisis in Sudan continues. Asrelief efforts proceed  our thoughts are with the refugeesof Darfur. We urge the Government of Sudan to doeverything in its power to bring that tragedy to an end.We think of those whose lives have beendevastated by the destructive fury of hurricanes in theCaribbean and on the Atlantic coast of the UnitedStates. We extend to them our deepest sympathies forthe loss of life and property.The perpetrators of the slaughter of innocents inRussia gave a new dimension to wickedness. Theydefeated their own cause through the ruthless andindiscriminate shedding of the blood of children.Nothing can justify what they did. The United Nationsmust be united against such infamy.Let us express our sympathy and solidarity withthe ordinary people of Iraq caught in that country’sterrible cycle of violence. Let this forum give them ourfull and unreserved support in the struggle for genuinedemocratic Government and the regaining of theirnational sovereignty. May their hopes for a peacefulfuture and lasting stability find fulfilment.We feel for the families of the people killed byterrorists outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta. We12want them to know that their pain is shared in thisfamily of nations.The plea from Fiji is for United Nations membercountries to strengthen their joint resolve to opposepolitical terror everywhere. This is a critical time inhistory. The United Nations is called upon to mobilizeall its experience  skills and powers to create concordamong nations. That was its founding principle. It isthe principle that must continue to drive and sustain theUnited Nations.Fiji  as always  is committed to the maintenanceof peace and security and to a world free of weapons ofmass destruction and terrorism.We want an end to ozone-depleting pollution andthe elimination of other hazards to the environment.The international community must continue tofight poverty and disease. HIV/AIDS has become morethan a health crisis. For some countries it is now asecurity threat. We in the Pacific have no immunityfrom this global epidemic. We would welcomecontinued assistance from the Global Fund to FightAIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria to supplement ourregional campaign to contain this scourge.The United Nations must continue to resistexternal interference in any form  which underminesthe sovereign right of every Member State to determineits own destiny. However  where there are internalcrises and disorder and the United Nations mandatesintervention for peace  we are ready to contribute. Weconsider it an honour to serve the cause of peace underthe flag of the United Nations and regionalorganizations like the Pacific Islands Forum. Fiji’ssoldiers and police officers have been taking part inUnited Nations peacekeeping operations since 1978.That has cost us 35 precious lives  but we remainstrong in our resolve to continue serving where we areneeded. Peacekeeping personnel from Fiji are workingin Liberia  the Sinai  Kosovo  Timor-Leste  theSolomon Islands and Bougainville  Papua New Guinea.My Government is now giving careful consideration torequests from the United Nations to assist it withsecurity personnel in Iraq.I would like to take this opportunity to express tothe United Nations and to those countries that haveassisted Fiji on a bilateral basis our gratitude for theirhelp in making it possible for us to honour ourcommitment to international peace and security.Through the Pacific Islands Forum  and with theassistance of Australia and New Zealand  we arecurrently preparing a Pacific plan to pool resources andefforts for the strengthening of collective interests. Wewill come together to combat the threat of terror and toimprove law enforcement and our defences againstterrorism and transnational crime. There will be acooperative approach to social and economicdevelopment  and especially for advancing trade investment and tourism. We will stand united to guard ouroceanic heritage  which is a treasure for all humanity.Our region has the world’s largest remaining sustainable tuna fishery  which is an essential source offood for the global market. But more than 95 per centof the value of the mid-Pacific Ocean tuna catch goesto distant-water fishing nations. We look to the UnitedNations and other international organizations to help usget a just return from that major natural resource. Fijicommends those countries that have already workedwith us to reach that goal. We would like to expressparticular thanks to the United States for its regionalfisheries treaty with certain Pacific island nations. Ourisland countries have now entered a new phase ofcooperation in the tuna industry through the Westernand Central Pacific Tuna Convention  which came intoeffect in June this year.In addition to reinforcing regional cooperation Fiji and its neighbours are giving special attention totheir relationships with countries in the wider Asia-Pacific region.We strongly support a role for Japan and India inan enlarged and strengthened Security Council. May Ialso add that Fiji would endorse the inclusion of SouthAfrica and Brazil as permanent members.Let me say that we greatly value the assistance ofAustralia  New Zealand and the United States insecuring our region as a zone of peace.It was heartening to see the two Koreas marchingand participating under a single banner at the OlympicGames in Greece. It is our prayer that that will lead tomore substantive progress in the reunification of theKorean people.We are glad to see the People’s Republic of Chinagrowing in stature and developing so quickly. Fiji enjoyssteadily strengthening relations with China and wants tosee those relations expanded further. It is committed to itsdiplomatic recognition and official relations with the13People’s Republic of China. At the same time  Fiji valuesits trade and economic ties with Taiwan. It is our ferventhope that their people will resolve their futurepeacefully through dialogue and consensus.For the past 29 years  close to 80 countries of theAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific Group (ACP) have beenthe beneficiaries of a historic development partnershipwith the European Union. I pay tribute to the leaders ofEurope and the ACP who pioneered that uniqueinternational North-South arrangement. Generousassistance in trade  aid and investment has contributedin very significant ways to the livelihood of millions ofpeople from poorer States.Now  as we begin negotiations with the EuropeanUnion for the continuation of those arrangements  weare finding to our dismay that the World TradeOrganization’s (WTO) insistence on free and opentrade will effectively mean for many ACP countries including Fiji  a massive loss in export earnings fromreduced prices. For our sugar industry the directconsequence will inevitably be that the price the canefarmers receive will fall substantially below theirproduction costs. That is despite the urgent andcomprehensive reforms we have embarked upon in oursugar industry to make it more productive  efficientand competitive.Those WTO hurdles are made more difficult bythe loss of competitive margins through the withdrawalof schemes like the Generalized System of Preferences.The consequence is that many small island developingStates  already disadvantaged by their smallness distance from export markets and regular devastationfrom natural disasters  are now faced with seriousuncertainty over their economic prospects. Wetherefore welcome the holding by the United Nationsof a special conference of small island developingStates early next year to review the Programme ofAction for those countries  the Barbados + 10 review. Ivery much hope that review will lead to newinternational commitments of assistance todisadvantaged small island developing States. Thosecommitments must underpin economic survival and asustainable future  as the world moves inexorablytowards a free and open trading system. It is also ourhope that the Barbados + 10 review will renew the callfor those States that have yet to sign or to ratify theKyoto Protocol to do so  for the sake of our planet.My Government commends the initiative takenby the International Labour Organization in its WorldCommission Report on the Social Dimension ofGlobalization. It is the international community’sresponsibility to ensure that for both developed anddeveloping countries  and for big and small countriesalike  globalization means a fair and equitable spreadof opportunities — opportunities manifested in newinvestments  more jobs  decent work and improvementsin education  health and other social amenities.For us in the Pacific  as small island nations there is another area of increased concern. We takegreat pride in our culture  customs and traditions. Theygive us our identity and oneness as indigenouscommunities and as Pacific island peoples. I appeal tothe General Assembly to bring before it for adoption atthe earliest opportunity the draft declaration on therights of indigenous peoples. I request the Secretary-General to expedite that process.While we acknowledge the importance of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and otherinternational instruments in the promotion of humanrights  we also recognize that they are primarilyconcerned with the rights of individuals. IndigenousPacific island communities see a United Nationsdeclaration on the rights of indigenous peoples asbeing vitally important for the international recognitionand acceptance of our right to self-determination and indeed  to our very survival as ethnically and culturallydistinct peoples. But that is not to say that we areunconcerned about other communities whose membersare fellow citizens with equal rights and responsibilities.Members of the Assembly are aware that Fiji hasa multiracial society. The ethnic Fijians and Rotumansare the indigenous community. Collectively andcommunally  they own close to 90 per cent of all landin the country. Settlers from India came some 125years ago and now comprise the majority of tenants ofnative land. Europeans  people of mixed ancestry Chinese and other Pacific islanders complete Fiji’scolourful cultural tapestry. We are proud of thatnational diversity. It gives our country its distinctivecharacter and its still unrealized potential.Although we have learned to co-exist without theracial violence and hatred common elsewhere  we arestill a country divided  especially in politics. Fromindependence  in 1970  we tried hard to createmultiracialism founded on mutual respect  mutual care14and understanding. But  unfortunately  during electionsthe overwhelming majority of voters still make theirchoices along ethnic lines. It is not because they areagainst candidates from other communities  it is justthat they find security and comfort in choosingrepresentatives from their own community.Since my Government came to office  in 2001 we have been engaged in a new quest for unity. Ourvision is for a peaceful  unified and prosperous Fiji.Politically  we wish to build on the concept ofguaranteed representation for our differentcommunities in Parliament. The challenge now is toextend this to representation in Government.As a parliamentary democracy  we are committedto Government based on the free will and consent ofthe people. But  at the same time  we want to ensurethat each community has a direct voice in nationaldecision-making. It is that desire for inclusion andequity that has led us to adopt measures to close thesocial and economic gap between Fijians and the othercommunities and between the affluent and thedisadvantaged and the poor. Increasingly  we arefinding that faith in God is a powerful instrument forforming bonds across the racial divide. We may followdifferent beliefs  but a common focus on the divine islighting the way forward.When I return to Fiji  the country will be gettingready for eight days of prayer  forgiveness andreconciliation. The aim is to bring people together andto create a sense of national purpose and patriotism.All the great faiths represented in Fiji will be part ofthat. Each contains in their teachings the jewels oftruth that gleam for all humanity. Each has animportant capacity for peace-making. Each can make avaluable contribution to increasing understanding andresolving differences.In those eight days in October  therefore  ourreligious leaders will join with other citizens of goodwill in this fresh search for togetherness. Thepromotion of unity has been a pressing nationalpriority since my Government came to office  fouryears ago. We understand that it will not come quickly.The General Assembly will be pleased to hear that ourcommunities themselves  through their religious andcultural organizations  are coming forward to join withthe Government in the making of a unified State. Theclimax of our national week of prayer and forgivenesswill be an interfaith service. We recognize that humaneffort alone is not enough for what we want to achieve.Just as this great Organization seeks a world ofharmony bound together by common ideals  we in Fijiwant our own United Nations  a united nation where ourcitizens live together happily and nationhood is fulfilled."
"59",2431,"FRA",59,2004,"I wouldlike to congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourelection. We are pleased that a man of your ability  aFrancophone representative of a friendly country  isdirecting our proceedings.I also wish to warmly applaud our Secretary-General. We have heard his message on respect for therule of law. And through the Secretary-General  I wish tocommend the entire staff of this institution  here andeverywhere in the world: their courage and commitmentare a credit to our ideals and to the organizations theyserve — sadly  sometimes at the cost of their ownlives.How are we to meet the challenges facing theworld? That is the question we all keep askingourselves  one after another  from this rostrum. Andhow are we to meet the world’s expectations unless weall mobilize? More than ever  the United Nationsremains the one irreplaceable  legitimate frameworkfor harnessing that mobilization and translating it intocollective action.We have much to do: conflicts remain unresolved while others are breaking out; poverty is declining all tooslowly; people are destroyed by wars; refugees are tornfrom their land; and the threat of terrorism is notfading. Yes  we have much to do. Yes  we have a dutyto act  and an obligation never to give up.The United Nations is acting — on all fronts  onthe front line. To resolve conflicts and prevent themfrom flaring up again  it is present everywhere  on allcontinents  in Haiti  Kosovo  the Democratic Republicof the Congo  in Côte d’Ivoire  Afghanistan and manyother fronts  deploying over 50 000 Blue Helmets. Itprovides assistance to 17 million people protected bythe High Commissioner for Refugees. Through theWorld Food Programme  it feeds more than 100 millionindividuals. And it helps  especially through the UnitedNations Development Programme  170 States orterritories to develop.United Nations activities — our activities —continue to expand. Thus  the Organization is calledupon to be at the centre of the counter-terrorismmeasures that the international community is putting inplace. The threat of terrorism  now a global one calling for a global response. That is why Francecommitted itself here to the fight  and did so againrecently by supporting the strengthening of theCounter-Terrorism Committee.The tragedy of 11 September  which I refer towith feeling here in New York City  was an attack onus all. Since then  terrorism has continued to strike: inEurope  in Madrid  six months ago; and in Asia  in Baliand Jakarta. Cowardly attacks are mounted against theweakest. How can we not be appalled at the tragedy ofthe school in Beslan where children — the symbol ofinnocence — were violently massacred?We are waging a merciless fight againstterrorism. Let us at the same time address its roots.That means putting an end to situations that terroristsexploit; giving the world’s excluded hope again;restoring dignity to those peoples deprived of it; andensuring that dialogue and cooperation amongcivilizations  cultures and religions prevail  rather thanconflict and intolerance.Global threats require a strong  and alwayscollective  response. The threat of proliferation  which29could merge with that of terrorism  calls for resoluteand sustained action. The non-proliferation regime hasbeen seriously undermined by the combined action ofcertain States and non-State actors. That is whystrengthening existing instruments is today essential.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) Review Conference in 2005 will be anopportunity to do so.A safer and freer world is  first  a more justworld. That is why we must act relentlessly to resolveconflicts. I am  of course  thinking  first and foremost of the Middle East  where — in the wake of the hopesraised by Madrid  Oslo  Camp David and Taba — theabsence of any prospect is today breeding despair extremism and violence of every kind. This centralcrisis can be resolved only through a negotiatedsettlement based on international law  enabling all thepeoples — I repeat  all the peoples — of the region tolive in dignity and security.The road map  which the parties have acceptedand which the Security Council has endorsed  must beimplemented in full and in good faith. France hopesthat the withdrawal from Gaza is a first step in thatdirection. It will make every effort to get the peaceprocess under way again. It will continue to act vis-à-vis all the leaders — the elected and legitimateleaders — of that region.Let us make no mistake: building peace in theMiddle East is a historic responsibility for ourgeneration. Europe — the European Union — inpartnership with the United States  Russia and theUnited Nations  is determined to play a political role inorder to stimulate this process.In Iraq  violence is exploding. It seems to us thatonly when the Iraqis themselves take control of theirfuture  and when the political process provided for bythe Security Council is pursued  will the country beable to escape the chaos that is destabilizing the entireregion. France  as everyone knows  did not approve ofthe conditions in which the conflict was unleashed.Neither today nor tomorrow will it commit itselfmilitarily in Iraq. However  it reaffirms its willingness with its European partners  to assist the Iraqi people inrebuilding their country and in restoring theirinstitutions.Who can fail to see that  in the Middle East everything is fragile and everything is interconnected?Who can fail to understand that the only path —everywhere — is sovereignty and justice for peoples?Only then will they make progress towards peace andthe economic and political modernization to whichthey are entitled.Africa  too  is where we will win or lose the battlefor justice. Without justice  there will be no peace.Without peace  there will be no lasting development. Thefuture of the African continent  and its stability anddevelopment  are a vital objective for us all.Today  with the impetus of the United Nations longstanding crises have been  or will be  settled —Mozambique  Sierra Leone and Liberia. Others however  have broken out  and together we mustprevent them from worsening or spreading: in Côted’Ivoire  the Central African Republic  and Darfur. TheGreat Lakes region is slow to find the path to peace just as the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea isslow to die  and the Somali question remains to beresolved.On that great continent  which is undergoingprofound change  facing real threats but alsoconsiderable potential  political leaders are todaydemonstrating a genuine determination to commit toworking to resolve conflicts and crises. That can beseen from the implementation of the New Partnershipfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD); the resolutecommitment of the African Union on the political frontand in the field; and the growing role of regionalorganizations. We resolutely support that commitment.For development  but also for peace-building  we wishto bring about the conditions for an effective andcoherent partnership between North and South.Given the magnitude of the goals and needs ofthe continent  I firmly believe in the importance ofpooling the efforts of the Europeans with those of ourAfrican partners  under United Nations auspices whenever necessary. I am convinced that ourexperience of European integration — withoutattempting to teach any lessons — can simply be usefulto that continent  and that is the sense of the statementmade on our behalf by the representative of thepresidency of the European Union  Bernard Bot  beforethe Assembly the day before yesterday.France has long been involved in strengtheningAfrican peacekeeping capacities. Today  the EuropeanUnion intends to make a commitment immediately andwith determination. Operation Artemis  in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  is proof of that30commitment. The creation of the European PeaceFacility now provides major support to Africanorganizations. We are willing  if the African Union sowishes  to assist it in its action for peace  as in theSudan.Mr. Olhaye (Djibouti)  Vice-President  took theChair.Justice and conflict prevention cannot bedissociated from collective action to promotedevelopment. The Millennium Goals — to which thedeveloping countries  donor States and multilateralinstitutions are committed — are an overriding obligationfor us all  especially the wealthiest countries.More than $50 billion a year is still needed toachieve those objectives — a fact of which we all areaware. On Monday  100-odd countries endorsed theNew York Declaration on Action Against Hunger andPoverty. Together they ask that additional resources beprovided for development  including throughinnovative mechanisms. This is a powerful movement launched in this very forum of the United Nations aimed at generating the necessary resources for justiceand for development. It is an important milestone. Mycountry is proud to have contributed to it  through thevoice of the President of the Republic  and it willcontinue to do so.But France is also fighting for a more controlled and therefore most just  globalization that would giveeveryone a chance. We advocate the establishment of apolitical body  in which the United Nations must haveits due place — to improve coordination of multilateralaction in the economic  social and environmental fieldsand to provide the necessary impetus. This is one of themajor issues that we must consider in coming months especially on the basis of the proposals that the Panelon reform is expected to make.Again  a more just world is a world that respectshuman dignity and freedom. Fundamental human rightsare universal. Each man  woman and child has theseinherent rights  and it is up to us to see that they thriveand are respected.It is also up to us to fight firmly anduncompromisingly against all manifestations of violenceand discrimination based on race  origin  gender orreligion. Our resolve in the area of human rights  aselsewhere  must remain absolute and constant. I meanthat we need a genuine dialogue with the civil societyand with all non-governmental organizations. The timehas come  it seems to us  to conclude the negotiation ofa conventional instrument on forced disappearances  torecognize the rights of indigenous peoples and tomobilize against all forms of modern slavery.Let us not rule out the use of force  in certaincases and on the appeal of victims  to prevent massivehuman rights violations and acts of violence againstcivilians. The Security Council has the honour ofassuming this responsibility  in accordance with theUnited Nations Charter.Let us also continue putting in place mechanismsto combat impunity  often the prerequisite for durablepeace and lasting reconciliation. The establishment ofthe International Criminal Court specifically meets thisobjective. We welcome the major milestone reachedwith the entry into force of the Rome Statute.The dignity of humankind and peoples alsorequires due respect for cultures in their diversity. Thesense of loss of identity contributes to the frustrationsthat breed a good many conflicts. The unity of theinternational community  it goes without saying  cannotbe synonymous with uniformity.The negotiation of a convention on culturaldiversity  which has just started at the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization is therefore  in our view  a key objective. It must producea concrete result  as planned  before the 2005 generalconference.Our planet is dangerous; it is also in danger. Theearth is showing signs of strain; we are not maintainingit; in fact  we are plundering it; the climate isdeteriorating. And yet  we should remember  scarcityof resources has at all times been a factor in conflict.For the future of our children  we must act while thereis still time.Is there among us  for that matter  one single issuethat more obviously ignores borders than ecology andecological security and requires coordinated action —that is  multilateral action? International governance inenvironmental matters is  it seems to us  inadequatetoday. We must simplify and strengthen the existinginternational regime on environmental issues  developmonitoring  and early warning expertise  and increasefinancing  especially for developing countries.Let us be clear-sighted. For the environment  asfor so many other issues  prevention costs less than31cure. In this regard  we hope the establishment of aUnited Nations organization for the environment willbe considered  based on the achievements of the UnitedNations Environment Programme. We propose that thisgreat undertaking  which is one of the Millennium Goals be on the agenda of the September 2005 summit.In a world — our world — where 800 millionpeople do not have enough to eat  where more financialresources are devoted to weapons than to development where millions of men  women and children are forcedto leave their land to escape destitution or massacres  theinternational community has a duty to act and to showimagination. It is here at the United Nations where wecan meet to take initiatives  to fight misfortune and toapportion the tasks  all of them urgent.The United Nations system  which is unique andmore indispensable than ever  also has an obligation toreform itself to meet new needs and new threats  and tomake the most of new technologies merely in order tolive in our times. The Secretary-General got down tothis problem at the start of his first mandate.Considerable work has already been done. Theproposals of the high-level panel will be the basis forthe next  still more ambitious  stages. France has madeproposals on many issues  such as peacekeepingoperations  human rights and development financing.We have also indicated  with Germany  how therepresentativity and legitimacy of Security Councilaction might be improved. We advocate enlargement inboth categories of members  permanent and non-permanent; and we have expressed support for theaspirations of Germany  Japan  Brazil and India  whichshould be accompanied by a country from Africa.In a complex and unpredictable world  it is ourjoint responsibility to maintain and strengthen the oneinstitution where all nations can work together  wherethey can unite to shape and control their commondestiny. Through its legitimacy and ever-increasingeffectiveness  the United Nations must be theinstrument of universal conscience for which it remainsthe crucible."
"60",2456,"FSM",59,2004,"I am honoured by the opportunity to speak before theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on behalf ofthe people of my Pacific island nation  the FederatedStates of Micronesia  and on behalf of our President Joseph J. Urusemal.Allow me to extend my congratulations to you Mr. President  on your well-deserved election to thishigh office. I would also like to recognize Mr. JulianRobert Hunte of Saint Lucia for his distinguishedservice as president of the General Assembly at itsfifty-eighth session.Sadly  there have been so many recent disasters inwhich innocent lives have been lost that time does notpermit me to mention them all. Whenever we learn ofhuman suffering brought about by the forces of nature —whether by earthquake  storms or otherwise — ourhearts go out to the victims. As Pacific islanders  mypeople feel a special sympathy for the victims of therecent typhoons and hurricanes in Haiti  Grenada Jamaica  Cuba  the Cayman Islands  the Bahamas Florida and in Japan and China  as well as in our owncountry and elsewhere in the Pacific  such as in Guam the Mariana Islands and in Niue. It does not take ascientist to see that such storms are now occurring withincreasing frequency and devastating intensity.We must also express our great sadness over thecontinuing loss of life at the hands of terrorists  and wecondemn in the strongest terms all those who wronglythink their causes are advanced by such misguidedacts. All human life is precious  but the recent terroristatrocity committed against schoolchildren in Beslan Russia  was particularly vile. The world must speak outwith one voice in utter contempt of those who wereresponsible.I regret to say that  in addition to working todefeat terrorism  this body must also find moreeffective means of combating genocide that issponsored or tolerated by a Government. There must beno refuge for those who would deny entire populationsthe basic right of existence.It is obvious today that expressions ofcondemnation and even multilateral treaties do notdeter such people. As our technology provides evenmore effective and readily available means of massdestruction  the bright promise of the coming yearscould be overwhelmed by an unthinkable nightmare.The people of the Federated States of Micronesiaknow that even we  the inhabitants of a remote islandnation  do not have the luxury of remoteness from thethreats posed by such crimes against humanity. These2are threats to which all are exposed and from which allare at risk. Though our numbers are relatively small many of our finest young citizens are standing todaywith others on the front lines against tyranny andoppression. We will not shirk our commitment  but  ifthere is any hope of making such crimes a thing of thepast  that commitment cannot be conditional orselective. It must be universal.Even if we summon up the will to act collectivelyto put down the darker side of human nature throughcollective action  we must work much harder on aglobal scale to move towards eliminating theconditions that provide fertile ground for the sponsorsof terrorism and genocide. These include conditions ofpoverty  hunger and inadequate access to clean water sanitation  health care and education. All thoseconditions  of course  are familiar to students of theUnited Nations Charter. Thanks in no small part to thework of the Organization  statisticians are able toidentify significant  even dramatic  progress over thepast 60 years  and those trends can be expected tocontinue as we dedicate ourselves to the attainment ofthe Millennium Development Goals.But trends do not mean much to the children whowill die of starvation today  tomorrow and the day aftertomorrow. Growth in gross domestic product is of littlecomfort to the man desperately trying to support afamily on less than $1 a day  who sees no hope ofimproving his situation. The world — acting throughthis and other bodies  in addition to providing directassistance — must redouble its efforts  because there isstill a long way to go  and this planet of ours becomesmore dangerous every day.As if what I have just mentioned were notchallenging enough  we also now know that the globalcommunity faces a wide variety of complex tasks inprotecting the planet from environmental catastrophe.We humans  sitting at the top of the genetic ladder have the capacity to foul the nest of Creation  and mostagree that that is happening to one degree or another.One thing is clear: we are the only ones who can dosomething about it. Considerable costs will beinvolved  and not just in funds. Some say that theindustrialized world must change its deeply ingrainedpatterns of energy consumption and make otheradjustments. Others say that the developing world mustswitch to more sustainable development approaches  ata higher initial cost.Can the nations of the world afford the price tagof achieving all those things? The economicindications are that we can; it is a question of will determination and perseverance. There is no lack ofwealth in this world. By just about any measurement people in the industrialized world today enjoy a farhigher standard of living than has ever been knownbefore. Many developing countries are not far behind.But  when it comes to actually taking the stepsnecessary to overcome the dilemmas I have mentioned we confront the real challenge: to determine the wisestallocation of our resources and to act accordingly  inthe spirit of the eight Millennium Development Goals.It does not take a great deal of wisdom toconclude that mankind must continue to place highpriority on the eradication of poverty and hunger.Likewise  the need for prudence in protecting ourearthly environment and its resources is increasinglyobvious. But allocating our resources properly identifying the correct timing  and acting so as to attainthose goals will require virtually every scientific economic  political and ethical capacity that we cansummon.The process must involve an even-handedapproach  without room for guilt  blame or jealousy.While there is a real need for action  there is no needfor panic. The planet can still be saved  and the socialconditions for despair can be overcome. We must however  all play our respective roles withcommitment  compassion and in accordance with anequitable division of responsibility. Let us put aside thefinger-pointing and the tyranny of self-interest  and letus set about the task.There are several issues of concern to my countryregarding which I would like  briefly  to be morespecific.First  Micronesia looks forward to the conveningof the International Meeting  in January 2005 inMauritius  which will conduct the critical 10-yearreview of the Barbados Programme of Action  focusingon the particular needs and vulnerabilities of the smallisland developing States as they pursue sustainabledevelopment. During the past 10 years  we have seenprogress in implementing the Programme of Action with the close involvement and support of theSecretariat. However  that progress needs to beaccelerated. The International Meeting will enable usto identify and make essential course corrections.3Naturally  over the past 10 years  we have also seen theemergence of new challenges and issues that were notoriginally addressed. Now these can also beconsidered. Overall  the outcomes of the InternationalMeeting should be target-oriented so that progress inimplementing the Programme of Action can be trackedand measured.Of course  the International Meeting will besuccessful only if the representatives of island Statesare able to attend. Micronesia thus calls upon the donorcommunity to provide generous support to the trustfund so that island States may be adequatelyrepresented at the Meeting. In that regard  I mustacknowledge and express appreciation to thosecountries that have already contributed. Developing-country partners and developed countries should alsomake every effort to be represented at the highestpossible political level to ensure that the InternationalMeeting receives the political support it needs for theeffective implementation of its outcomes.Perhaps foremost among the vulnerabilities ofMicronesia — together with other members of theAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) — is ourextreme exposure to the adverse effects of globalclimate change. For more than a decade now  we havebeen vocal in this body and elsewhere on virtuallyevery aspect of climate change. One aspect of thatissue is a source of increasing concern to me as thedebate evolves beyond whether climate change is realto what should be done about it  and that aspect has todo with environmental ethics.In Micronesia  as in most island States  ourpeople have a tradition of living in harmony withnature. Consequently  our ecological “footprint” hasbeen small. While we who live on islands can and needto do more to curb unsustainable practices  it is clearthat we have contributed little to the climate crisis andthat we can contribute little to its solution. Yet we areamong the first to be affected and even face possibleextinction.For the populations of low-lying small islands however  practical options are few. Land is in shortsupply on islands in the best of times  and that land haslong been taken. Contrary to the romantic fantasy there are no desert islands available; island populationsalready tend to be concentrated. Previous efforts torelocate island populations have brought suffering andcultural losses to the people concerned. To those of usfacing the prospect of cultural eradication  theunabated advancement of already-inflated lifestyles inthe industrialized world does not seem a “greatergood”. We continue to support the call of AOSIS forimmediate implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.Export and licensing income from the bounty ofMicronesia’s waters and its vast exclusive economiczone is by far the greatest contribution to the nation’sbudget  next to foreign assistance. Fisheries are also avital resource of virtually every Pacific island country.A cooperative approach on the part of coastal Statesand distant-water fishing nations in the sustainableconservation and management of those resources isessential  since we now know that they are notinexhaustible.Thus  Micronesia welcomes the entry into forceof the Convention on the Conservation andManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in theCentral and Western Pacific Ocean  establishedpursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Lawof the Sea. We call upon all States and entities thathave participated in the process of establishing theConservation and Management Convention to assignhigh priority to cooperating fully in the implementationof its provisions.I would like to put on record my country’sgrowing concern over the practice of deep-seatrawling. The region of the Pacific contains literallythousands of seamounts  which scientists are finding tobe extremely rich in biodiversity and which hold greatpotential value for future generations. Yet  short-sightedly  too many are dragging trawl nets over thesedeep-ocean areas  unknowing and uncaring as to thedamage they are causing to the seabed below.There is an urgent need for an improved andcoordinated scientific focus on identifying andmanaging risk to biodiversity and the environment inthe deep oceans. We need to broaden our presentlyinadequate knowledge about these unique oceanhabitats and ensure that they are managed in asustainable way. Meanwhile  given the risk posed bypresent practices  we urge the international communityto impose and observe a moratorium on deep seatrawling.Despite the extension in 2001 of the time frameset by the parties to the United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea for a delimitation of the continentalshelf  Micronesia and many small island developing4States face continuing difficulties in meeting ourobligations in this regard. The problem is a lack offinancial resources and the scientific and technicalexpertise needed to acquire and collate the highlycomplex scientific data. Without targeted assistancefrom the donor community  countries like Micronesiawill find it extremely difficult to make the requiredsubmission on the limits of the continental shelf  evenwithin the extended time frame.As neighbours and fellow islanders  we aresaddened by the inability of the people of the Republicof the Marshall Islands  after almost 50 years  to securefull compensation for the death  sickness anddestruction they suffered as a consequence of nuclearweapons testing. Recently declassified documentsmake it clear that the original settlements were notbased on the full story of what happened to theMarshallese people as well as other peoples of theformer Trust Territory. We join other Members incalling upon the United States to meet its responsibilityin full.This year  Micronesia wishes to again express itssupport for United Nations reforms  particularly for thereform of the Security Council and the inclusion of ourneighbour  Japan  among its permanent members. Weare increasingly concerned over the seeming lack ofprogress on this critical matter.My final topic is security in the region of thePacific. Our President shared with leaders at therecently-concluded annual meeting of the PacificIslands Forum in Apia  Samoa  a common concern thatamidst all the current attention to global securityissues  the nations of the Pacific islands are being leftlargely to their own devices in dealing with threatsrelated to organized crime and terrorism. We areworking hard to address our vulnerabilities in theseareas  but I would like to simply note here that the restof the world  especially the North  is not serving itsown best interests by giving short shrift to thepossibilities for criminal and terrorist exploitation thatare presented by our vast region. Over and above othertraditional official development assistance  we need arange of targeted assistance in our region.Once again  it has been our most valuedopportunity to appear and address the GeneralAssembly. The need for this Organization has neverbeen stronger  and as each year goes by  it seems thatthe significance and relevance of our Charter increases.In these difficult times  we in Micronesia choose not tolose heart  but rather to take heart that we  the nationsof the world gathered here  can together build not just abetter world  but one that is a worthy inheritance forfuture generations."
"61",2499,"GAB",59,2004,"At the outset I would like to express to Member Statesmy deepest gratitude — that of the Government andpeople of Gabon — for the great honour and theconfidence shown in Gabon and in Africa through theelection of one of its sons to the lofty post of Presidentof the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Wehave long been familiar  Mr. President  with yourdiplomatic skills and your personal dedication to thecause of the United Nations system  and we have fullconfidence that you will successfully discharge yourduties.I wish to reiterate to your predecessor my sincerecongratulations on the work he accomplished duringhis mandate.To the Secretary-General  I wish to reaffirm myconfidence and the support of my country in the pursuitof your action heading the United Nations.Four years ago  we unanimously adopted theMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). Withrenewed energy and will  we have undertaken toachieve a number of its goals by the year 2015: inparticular  to reduce poverty and hunger  to combatHIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  and to establish aglobal partnership for development.Achieving these goals will clearly require astrong political impetus on our part. That is why I hailthe initiative of convening a United Nations summitdedicated  inter alia  to the implementation of theMillennium Goals  and scheduled for 2005 in NewYork. The major disparities which come to light dailybetween the rich and the poor countries evoke seriousconcern. We cannot reconcile ourselves to the despairwhich would result from failure. The African States for their part  reject such an inevitability; they arebecoming involved in the prevention and resolution ofthe conflicts undermining their continent  are settlinginto good governance and are making efforts toimplement the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment (NEPAD).At the same time  the international community the Group of Eight countries and the specializedinstitutions of the United Nations system  including theBretton Woods institutions  have a moral obligation totranslate into concrete action their commitments tosupport Africa’s development. That developmentnaturally hinges on the maintenance of internationalpeace and security throughout the African continent.Our determination in that respect is unequivocal.Such is the case in Côte d’Ivoire  where the peaceprocess was relaunched at the Accra summit in July2004. The same holds true for the decision of theAfrican Union to play an active role in the resolutionof the crises in Darfur  Burundi  Liberia  Sierra Leoneand the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Thesupport provided by the United Nations in thosecountries and the role played by the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  must be commended.Moreover  we welcome the prospects for a moreeffective contribution by the United Nations in theprocess of the reconstruction of Iraq and support forthe political transition under way there. It is indeedvital for regional stability and for peace that Iraq onceagain become a normally functioning State with stableinstitutions.In the lengthy conflict between the State of Israelad the Palestinian people  the restoration of lastingpeace will be possible only at the negotiating table. Italso depends on the reactivation of the road map.In this case  as in many others  such as the war oninternational terrorism  United Nations action must bemore effective. The decisions of the Security Councilwill then be decisive in the settlement of suchconflicts.Given the numerous crisis situations throughoutthe world  the role of the Security Council in themaintenance of international peace and security hascontinued to grow. Its field of action  in terms of itsdecisions  has gradually expanded  and the human material and financial resources required for theirimplementation have increased.To cope with these situations  a significantnumber of States must participate in its action. Thatrequires an expansion of the membership of theSecurity Council  in both categories — permanent andnon-permanent.16Need I recall that in 1977  from this very rostrum I drew the Organization’s attention to the need toprovide a seat for Africa in the Security Council. It isindeed paradoxical that Africa is still not countedamong the permanent members  even though the bulkof the Council’s decisions directly involve Africa. Wetherefore must adapt the Security Council to thechanging realities of our world. Its reform must begiven high priority at this session.Beyond that  our efforts at reform must have astheir ultimate objective the strengthening of the actionof the entire United Nations system in the areasidentified during the Millennium Summit in 2000.Striving to achieve these shared goals  Africa isincreasingly shouldering its share of responsibility.Shared and intensive solidarity on the part of countrieswith greater resources is more than ever required. Whatis at stake today is the survival of millions ofindividuals throughout the world.Poverty — one of the root causes of political economic and social instability  which are sources ofarmed conflict — must be eradicated.Therefore  we must implement  here and now  thecommitment we have undertaken to change the courseof our shared history. Let us together nurture the hopeof a better destiny — the hope that we can think andact in a different manner  in order to provide presentand future generations with genuine reasons for hope."
"62",2546,"GBR",59,2004,"Mr. President  Ioffer my congratulations and those of my country onyour election as President of the General Assembly atits fifty-ninth session.Eighteen months ago  the United Nations faceddivisions more serious than any since the Cubanmissile crisis of October 1962. We all worried whetherthe strength and unity which we had built up since theend of the cold war could survive.Then last year we watched  as Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan stood at his now famous fork in the road.In the year since  almost instinctively  we have decidedto follow our Secretary-Generalís directions. ThisOrganization has not been plunged  as some predicted into paralysis; instead  I have felt a powerful ifunspoken determination to make the United Nationswork  and to work more effectively  to fulfil its centraltask: to secure peace around the world.Over the last 12 months we have dealt with newcrises such as that in Darfur in the Sudan  where wehave set clear tasks for both the Sudanese Governmentand the rebel groups. We have tackled the situation inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the GreatLakes; mobilized international support for the newIraq; and addressed a long list of hugely importantsubjects which rarely receive the coverage they shouldin the media ó Haiti  Georgia  Timor-Leste Bougainville and Western Sahara.We have shown in those actions the unity ofpurpose which is one of the strongest weapons in ourhands to defeat the evils which today affect the globe.And the search for consensus has not been confined tothe Security Council.I am proud that just a few months after thedifficult times of early last year  France  Germany andthe United Kingdom came together to work  as wecontinue to do  on the Iran dossier before theInternational Atomic Energy Agency.I recognize  of course  the frustrations which allof us feel  not least over the Israel-Palestine conflict where the clear path to peace set out in the road mapand endorsed by the Security Council remains elusive.But all in all we have shown the will to make collectiveaction work  though we know  too  that we need to gofurther.In particular  we need to get better at tacklingthreats which have changed dramatically since thefounding of the United Nations. Today the greatestthreats to our security often come not from otherfunctioning sovereign States  but from terroristorganizations  from failing States and from man-madeshocks to our environment like climate change  whichcan exacerbate State failure and breed internalinstability.The High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges andChange appointed by the Secretary-General ispreparing its recommendations on ways to address thevarious challenges. We should remember in all this thatwe have one great advantage. Though its institutionsand the founding text of the Charter has hardlychanged in 60 years  the United Nations is not anorganization set in stone  but a set of living institutionsbased on a shared will to make collective securitywork. The United Nations has adapted in the past -with the development of peacekeeping  a greater focuson individual rights and the setting of global targets for34development - and I am confident that it can adapt inthe future.Of course  institutional change is part of that. Atthe United Nations foundation  one eighth of itsmembers could expect to be elected members of theSecurity Council at any one time. Today thatproportion is less than one eighteenth. The UnitedKingdom has long supported the case for expandingthe Security Council to  say  24 members  and forincluding amongst the permanent members: Germanyand Japan  two countries which between themcontribute 28 per cent of the budget of the UnitedNations; India  which represents one sixth of the entireworldís population; and Brazil  which just missedpermanent membership back in 1945.But we should not see an expansion of theSecurity Council  or other institutional change  as apanacea. The biggest need is to adapt our commonunderstanding - the United Nations jurisprudence  ifyou like - and its operational effectiveness so that wecan respond more quickly and more thoroughly totodayís new threats.Let me highlight three areas which to me seemparticularly important: first  our approach must bebroader and must tackle threats to the most vulnerable including poverty  disease and environmentaldegradation; secondly  we must build a new consensus byexpanding the scope of collective action; and  thirdly  wemust deal with the threat of terrorism  which menacesus all and everything for which we stand.Let me now take these three points in turn. First there is the need for a broader approach whichaddresses the complex and interdependent nature ofsecurity today. Here  we have to do more to meet theMillennium Development Goals and to promotesustainable development  especially in Africa. Wecannot have security without development ordevelopment without security.As the Secretary-General highlighted in hisspeech this week  we have to do more to entrench therule of law and justice  especially in States recoveringfrom conflict. The United Kingdom will pursue workon the Secretary-Generalís report during its SecurityCouncil presidency next month.We could also use the United Nations better  toagree to monitor and help implement globally acceptednorms of good governance.And we need to act together quickly on climatechange  perhaps the greatest long-term threat to ourworld in terms of stability and security. We have toimplement Kyoto - and I greatly welcome what mycolleague  His Excellency Sergey Lavrov had to say onthat today - and agree to emission reductions beyond2012.My second point is the need to build a newconsensus on the scope of collective action. We allrepresent independent  sovereign states. But even as wefounded the United Nations we recognized thatsovereignty was a trust in the hands of a nationísgovernment: there to be respected  not abused  fromeither without or within.The Charter set out arrangements so that an abusefrom without could be dealt with through the inherentright of self-defence recognized in Article 51 of theCharter. But it also said that an abuse from withinwhich threatens the peace could and should be dealtwith by the Security Council  under the powersenshrined in the other articles of Chapter VII of theCharter  and by the many conventions concludedwithin the United Nations framework  including  forexample  the 1948 Geneva Convention. No longer -we all said - could or should the world turn awayfrom unspeakable barbarities like that of the Holocaust.But we have not always lived up to those highexpectations  as the tragedies of Rwanda and Bosniaten years ago reminded us. Today we must resolve todo so and to engage in situations of humanitariancatastrophe or grave violations of internationalhumanitarian law and to act in the face of other threatsto international peace and security.The principle of non-interference has to bequalified by a duty to protect  especially whereGovernments are failing in that duty.We therefore need  for example  to be ready tosupport greater use by the Secretary-General of hispowers under Article 99 of the Charter  to bring threatsto peace to the Security Council's attention. We have toact quickly in response  because prevention is far betterthan cure. We should look to work more closely withregional organizations  as we are doing with theAfrican Union in Darfur. We need more discussion onthe criteria as to when the international communitymight have to intervene with military force in extremecircumstances. We must get better at engaging for thelong term in countries recovering from conflict 35coordinating our efforts in response to locally agreedpriorities.My third point is the urgent need to combatglobal terrorism  a menace directed at us all. If we havelearned anything in the three years since 11 September2001 it is that international terrorism is indiscriminatein its targets and merciless in its hatred. Christian  Jew Hindu  Buddhist  Sikh  Muslim  people of no religionor any religion  and of every or no shade of politicalopinion  all have died through the terroristsí bullet orbomb.My friend Sergey Lavrov spoke eloquently amoment ago about the tears still wet for the terrible unspeakable massacre of the young and innocent thattook place in Beslan. Sergey  your tears are my tears;Russiaís tears are the worldís tears. We are all in thefight against terrorism together.Today in Iraq we are seeing again the depths towhich the terrorists plumb. The vast majority of thevictims of terrorism in Iraq are Iraqis. Our thoughtsand condolences are with the Government and peopleof Iraq and with their families. But some of the victimsof terrorism in Iraq are foreigners who are helpingIraqis to build a more stable and prosperous country.One of them is Kenneth Bigley  a British engineer heldhostage by terrorists who have already barbaricallymurdered his two American comrades. Our thoughtsand prayers are with their families. We continue to doall we can to secure Mr. Bigleyís release.I know - how could I forget - that opinionshave differed over the rightness of the military actiontaken in Iraq 18 months ago. But I warrant that nonation is in favour of the terrorist insurgency nowoccurring there. For we all recognize that what is beingattempted by the terrorists in Iraq is an attack both onthe Iraqi people and on everything for which theOrganization stands: safety  security and human rights.We have to come together to defeat the terrorists andtheir despicable aims.The threat of terrorism confronts democratic properly functioning States with an acute dilemma namely  how to fight those who recognize none of thevalues for which we stand while remaining true tothose values. Our commitments under internationalconventions express many of those values and theimportance that we attach to them. But equally  thoseconventions cannot be allowed to shelter thoseinvolved in terrorism. The conventions were designedto protect citizens from abuse by States  not byterrorists.The 1951 Convention relating to the Status ofRefugees protects those with a well-founded fear ofpersecution. I am proud that the United Kingdom and somany other nations have offered that protection when andwhere it was required. But as the 1951 Conventionitself sets out  asylum is not an unqualified right. It doesnot apply to anyone who has committed a war crime  acrime against humanity or other serious crime; nordoes it apply to anyone who is guilty of acts contraryto the purposes and principles of the United Nations.We must never stoop to the level of the terrorist óto torture  mistreatment or unjustified incarceration ónor will any country within the European Union beparty to the return of suspects to such conditions  norto face the death penalty. But we cannot let terroristsexploit a protection designed for the persecuted  notthe persecutors. We in the United Kingdom shalltherefore be working closely with Russia on itsimportant draft Security Council resolution  to see howbest we can prevent those who commit  support andfinance terrorism from sheltering behind a refugeestatus to which they are not entitled. Along with theRussian Federation and other partners in the SecurityCouncil  we also wish to look at ways to ensure thespeedier extradition of such individuals.We  the United Nations  have over the last yearbegun to show a new determination to come togetherand to make collective action work. A year from now we will meet again here to review therecommendations of the High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change  as well as the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  and to set the United Nationsagenda for the next decade. The United Kingdomíschairmanship of the G-8 next year will focus ontackling climate change and on Africa  on which theIndependent Commission for Africa will be producingrecommendations as to how best we can support theradical agenda for change and development designedby Africa itself through the New Partnership forAfricaís Development and the African Union. Ourpresidency of the European Union will help us to leadefforts for a successful outcome in the DohaDevelopment Round  and for building the EuropeanUnionís crisis-management capabilities.More than ever  global security is our sharedresponsibility. In the year ahead  as we continue to36adapt to todayís threats and challenges  we must findrenewed determination and political will to makecollective security work. The United Kingdom isdetermined to play its full part in that endeavour."
"63",2570,"GEO",59,2004,"It ismy pleasure and honour to represent my country todayat the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly ofthe United Nations. Let me begin by expressing mydeep appreciation for Mr. Julian Hunte  for theleadership and vision with which he conducted the lastsession  and by congratulating Mr. Jean Ping on hisassumption of the presidency of this session.I would also like to take this opportunity toexpress my Governmentís deep gratitude to theSecretary-General for his leadership  for his strongcommitment and hard work to make the United Nationsa more responsive and efficient body. The Governmentof Georgia reaffirms its strong support for theimportant work carried out around the world by thisgreat institution and to all who serve it.The beginning of the new millennium marks agreat opportunity for the global community of nationsthat make up the United Nations - a communitywhose collective responsibility is to help strengthenthose institutions that promote and protect theprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations  so that we can more effectively tackle thechallenges and the issues facing the world today and sothat together we can enhance our shared ability topromote peace  alleviate suffering  expand liberty andadvance human development with renewed wisdomand courage.The belief that we must be able to adapt to greatchange while remaining faithful to a set of core ideasand values is one that has special resonance in Georgiatoday  for few countries have witnessed greatertransformation in the past year ó and fewer still havedone so with a clearer sense of purpose. In somerespects  Georgia's revolution has made our smallnation - willingly or unwillingly - a test case for themodern challenges of democratic transition andperhaps for a revised formula for international relationsin our increasingly interconnected and complex world.Nearly a year has passed since our dramatic RoseRevolution graced the cover of newspapers andtelevision broadcasts around the world. This revolutionhad at its core one simple demand: the creation of astable  equitable and functional democracy. It gives megreat pride  Mr. President  to inform you that we haveaccomplished that demand in ways that few abroad orat home ever imagined possible. And I am enormouslyproud of my people  whose courage  unity andsteadfast belief in a better future made our revolutionand transformation possible. It is because of theGeorgian people that our experiment in democracy is a12success  and because of their sacrifice anddetermination that we have achieved such impressiveresults today.In less than a year  we have proven the depth andbreadth of our commitment to democracy successfullyby holding three sets of elections - presidential parliamentary and regional - which were recognizedby all observers as free and fair expressions of thepublic will.We have proven that we can take care of peoplesuch as the teachers of my country  who just a few daysago received as much as 12 years in back pay from ourGovernment. I was recently told by a local governor ofhow one such teacher - who had not been paid sinceour independence - had just received her payment forall of those years. For all of those years  that bravewoman  who sacrificed her health and her livelihoodfor the education of younger generations whilesurviving on the meagre income from a small plot ofland  watched as our corrupt officials - at her expenseand that of her compatriots - were creating their ownwealth  constructing huge mansions and filling theirSwiss bank accounts. Finally she got her money back.She also watched the corrupt officials chased awayfrom power and held accountable under our legislation.Never again will loyal public servants have toharvest food from their gardens to make ends meet.Never again will they have to face a Government thatdisrespects their dignity. Protecting people like thatteacher is the reason why we have confrontedcorruption in Georgia so vigorously  since corruptionthreatened the very fabric of our society. By first goingafter government officials who were corrupt and whoenjoyed a near-untouchable status  and then seeking toaddress the institutional aspects - the corruption thatbasically gave rise to such government officials - wehave been able to reinstate the rule of law and createlasting change in the system.That is why we conducted a radical downsizingof our security services  police and customs by up to 50per cent. Instead of poorly paid governmentofficials - civil servants who were not given any realsalaries and who were compelled to extort money fromtheir fellow citizens - we have now introduced newsalaries that are sometimes 8 to 10 times greater thanthose paid previously  as well as new rules of the game.We have introduced new salaries that aresometimes eight to 10 times larger than those paidpreviously  as well as new rules of the game. We haveintroduced the first-ever civilian leadership in defence security and law-enforcement bodies. We have madethese painful choices because we know that  unless wechange the system itself  we cannot change the corruptbehaviour of our State officials. It is those officialswho are responsible for the corrupt behaviour ofbusinesses ó not the businessmen themselves.It is we who are responsible for failing to build abetter future for our citizens. Winning this battle willmean that all citizens of my country will finally have achance to live in a normal State - where merit ratherthan money makes a difference  and where rules andlaws firmly and clearly govern people's actions.As I said earlier  in order to make such changespermanent and sustainable  we have raised salaries six eight or even tenfold for public servants  so thatincentives are aligned  a fair system can flourish andpeople can serve the State with dignity and honour.That is why we have created a new tax systemthat clarifies and simplifies both the payment and theadministration of taxes - creating the lowest-taxregime and the least complicated tax code in theregion  and eliminating institutional sources ofcheating and corruption.To hesitate or move cautiously at this criticalstage would mean reneging on the promises we havemade and returning to business as usual in this part ofthe world. Our people will not forgive any hesitation.I believe that we cannot refrain from initiatingreforms and taking radical steps at this time if we trulywant to build a better future and forever change therules of the game.But Georgia today is a visibly different State thanit was one year ago  with fewer games and new rules.That is why those who fled Georgia throughout the pastdecade - one of decay and crisis - are now startingto return to their homeland. They are putting theirskills  talents  ideas and energy to work for their newcountry. There is a great deal of new energy and a newoptimism  which we are happy to observe.There is a renewed sense of hope and a renewedsense of purpose that speaks of unity and the uniquestrength that comes with it. Georgia's experiment indemocracy is an ongoing success  not simply because Ideclare it or wish it  but  rather  because the people ofGeorgia continue to embrace it. We are a nation that13has a strong cultural heritage and identity  but that atthe same time celebrates and cherishes religious andethnic tolerance and religious freedom as part of thatidentity and that heritage. We are a nation that believesin the sanctity of rule of law and a strong judicialsystem.One thing is clear: democracy is thriving in ourpart of the world although many people thought itwould not be possible. That is because the principles ofdemocratic governance are reflected in our nationalidentity and universal desire to be free.The creation of a successful State depends on theability of its institutions to act maturely andresponsibly in the face of shared challenges. In thisnew millennium  it is clear to all responsible nationsthat one issue above all others unites us as we seek topromote lasting peace  security and prosperity: thecommon war on terrorism.As a member of the global coalition that seeks toeliminate the threat of terrorism  Georgia has made and will continue to make  contributions whereverpossible and wherever necessary. Our willingness toact responsibly and to contribute is evident today inKosovo and in Iraq - and soon will be inAfghanistan - all places to which we have sent ourforces to serve alongside others in the pursuit of peaceand freedom. For terrorism knows no greater enemyand no greater force than the one embodied in a freesociety.Today I am proud to announce Georgia's newestcontribution to freedom: our offer to send fresh troopsto Iraq to serve in the special protection force for theUnited Nations Mission in Iraq. In offering ourservices to the United Nations Mission  we are hopefulthat our presence will foster lasting stability  prosperityand freedom for the Iraqi people ó freedom worthy ofall those who live in the region at large.In the context of our cooperation withinternational anti-terrorist efforts  we especially valuethe work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee of theSecurity Council  and we support the idea ofstrengthening the Terrorism Prevention Branch of theSecretariat.At this point  however  one could reasonably askwhy such a small country - one of fewer than5 million people - is so out in front in its internationalcommitments to fighting terrorism and in contributingto that global cause. The answer is as painful as it issimple. Simply put  Georgia's commitments to fightingterrorism reflect our deep understanding of thedestruction that it can and has wrought in our owncountry and in our immediate neighbourhood. Georgiaunderstands that we must do all we can to defeatterrorism.Unfortunately  Georgia today is still dealing withthe results of unresolved separatist conflicts in twoparts of our country ó Abkhazia and South Ossetia.Those conflicts have resulted in loss of life  thedestruction of property  and the forced exodus andethnic cleansing of 300 000 Georgians  thus creating alarge population of internally displaced persons. Thoseconflicts cannot remain unresolved; we as a countrywill never get used to the loss of control over that partof the territory or to the plight of those who have beendeprived of their livelihoods and their basic humanrights.Georgia's new democracy is committed toresolving these conflicts  because no democracy canallow black holes to exist on its territory. Indeed  theirexistence is fundamentally incompatible with progress development and lasting stability. No democracy cantolerate them on its territory.Today  we are living in an era where the civilizednations of the world are united in a global war onterrorism  and  in that world  neither Georgia nor therest of the international community can afford to lookthe other way. Uncontrolled zones breed crime  drugtrafficking  arms trading and  most notably  terrorism.The threats posed by violent separatism affect thesecurity not only of Georgia but of the entire Caucasus.In places like Abkhazia  on the shores of the BlackSea  these lawless zones have the potential to affectEuropean security as long as the situation thereremains unresolved.The lawless territories of Abkhazia and SouthOssetia are safe havens for mini-dictatorships  tightlycontrolled by elite groups that seek to profit from thecriminal status quo. It causes me pain to say that  inthese extremely closed societies ó by and large cut offfrom the rest of the world ó children grow up withguns in their hands instead of books. Their heads arefilled with hatred and intolerance  instead of respect fordifference and appreciation for cultural diversity.14We must put an end to this cycle of destruction.We must do more to eliminate the threats to peace andsecurity that have for too long retarded ourdevelopment.As we seek to find lasting solutions to theseìfrozenî conflicts  once again Georgia can beconsidered a test case. Our success in that respectwould be your success  too. Here  I want to state in theclearest of terms that Georgia is fully committed tosolving these conflicts through solely peaceful means.Georgia will not and cannot use violence to solve theseconflicts  because no democracy can go to war againstits own people.What all parts of Georgia need today isdevelopment  investment  security and lastingeconomic growth. We will peacefully reincorporateSouth Ossetia and Abkhazia  so that all citizens ofGeorgia can share in the fruits of our success.I believe that the most effective mechanism forestablishing Georgiaís unity is the creation of a strongeconomy  where those who are not yet sure if they wantto remain outside Georgia will be given real incentivesand chances to benefit from a prosperous  tolerant andsuccessful State ó a place where they and theirchildren will be able to find jobs  earn stable incomes and have access to new opportunities and investments.In a strengthened economy  all of Georgia'sinhabitants will know that they live in a State that isable to care for and look after them ó in sickness andin health. These are the qualities that an economicallystrong and democratically vibrant Georgia willguarantee all its citizens. We must do everythingpossible to realize that vision if we want to build aunited future. As Georgia looks to the future  it does sowith a clear and understandable plan. Today  I wouldlike to introduce the idea of a new stage-by-stagesettlement plan  designed to speed the resolution ofthese conflicts.Step one is to initiate confidence-buildingmeasures  so that new forms of trust are establishedthat create lasting human bonds between peoples.Those measures could include exchanges and linksbetween various non-governmental organizations óyouth group to youth group  student to student journalist to journalist  athlete to athlete  health-careworker to health-care worker  mother to mother ó sothat more citizens and more segments of our societycan learn to understand one another and to trust oneanother.Building confidence means pursuing jointeconomic projects that create wealth where today thereis want and create profits where today there is poverty.Building confidence means restoring and guaranteeingthe right of internally displaced persons to return totheir native homes.We can and must build confidence betweenpeoples  as the first precondition for peace. We can andmust do more to protect human rights throughinternational police forces in places like Gali andthrough the existing Human Rights Office of theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe located in Gali.Together  we could move on to step two  whichwould focus on specific measures aimed at achievingdemilitarization and a truly international format for apeacekeeping operation in our area  transforming thecurrent peacekeeping operation into a broadinternational operation  so that the people of thoseregions can live free from fear of uncontrolled militias irregulars and violent gangs  which hold us all hostageto the status quo.Those steps will require monitoring  verificationand transparency  so that we can achieve the necessaryresults.The third stage  step three  envisions a globalsolution with global guarantees that would lead to theestablishment of the fullest and broadest form ofautonomy ó one that protects culture and languageand guarantees self-governance  fiscal control andmeaningful representation and power-sharing at thenational government level. Most important  it wouldlead to an autonomy that empowers average people  sothat isolated elites no longer act as the sole decisionmakers over peopleís future.Georgia greatly appreciates the support renderedby the Group of Friends and the Geneva process  aswell as the concepts and principles contained withinthe Boden document  which should be transmitted tothe Abkhaz side.Now is the time to enhance those commitments;now is the time for the international community to domuch more. Simply put: the international communitycan no longer afford to look the other way when grossviolations of human rights take place in separatist15enclaves  just as they can no longer afford to ignore thesecurity risks that emanate from those black holes andsmugglersí safe havens.The relevance of that point was brought to theattention of the world after terrorists seized a school ofinnocent children in Beslan  surprising and shockingthe world with their brutality. The people of Georgiawere deeply shocked  and we of course condemn thatbrutal act and express deep sympathy to the families ofthe victims of that terrible tragedy  which sentshockwaves through every Georgian household.As we know  the terrorists that seized the schoolare common enemies of Russia and Georgia alike. Wehad seen such individuals ó notorious for their acts ofdestruction  violence and killing ó when theyunleashed the same kind of bloodshed in the name ofAbkhaz separatism 10 or 11 years ago. Those terribleevents prove once again that we cannot afford to ignorethe dangerous linkages that exist between theseparatism on one side of the Caucasus mountains andthe violence on the other side.All separatists sow the seeds of great instability and lawless zones can be sanctuaries for criminals whoconduct acts of terror. It is our moral obligation to putan end to the unilateral practice of reaching out toseparatists without the consent or knowledge of theauthorities of the central Government in Tbilisi. Inorder to defeat that evil  we must not allow doublestandards to persist. I believe that we can worktogether with other countries in that respect.The time has come for Georgia and Russia toenter a new stage of cooperation whose goal is todefeat that common enemy. It is our moral obligationand profound responsibility to join forces morerobustly in that cause.I firmly agree with President Putin that we cannever negotiate with terrorists or cut deals with killers.But we may - and we should - work with moderateelements who seek peace without violence.We must reach out to every segment of society.We must do away forever with the Basayevs of theworld  no matter what side of the border they terrorize and reach out to ordinary  peace-loving people. Allforms of violent separatism - whether in Tskhinvali Grozny or Sukhumi - represent destabilizing factorsfor Russia and Georgia alike.I am confident that  by working together morerobustly  we can make great progress in reducing thatshared risk. I believe that there are a number ofconcrete initiatives on which we can embark today thatwill bring immediate results - initiatives that againconfirm Georgia's status as a test case for thepromotion of a foreign policy that leads us away fromthe outdated politics of domination  advancing  instead our shared interest and the great potential for regionalcooperation.That means finally coming to grips with the needto close outdated Russian military bases  left over fromthe past and from a country that no longer exists.Let me be clear: while we appreciate any help instrengthening our security structures so as to make us amore responsible contributor to international peace andsecurity  Georgia is firm in its position that we will nothave any new foreign military bases on our territory.Today  Georgia needs bridges  not bases; roads not rockets. And we need cooperation  not competition when it comes to eliminating sources of instability andterror.The mechanics of the new relationship withRussia means pooling our resources and efforts tocreate a joint anti-terrorism centre to counter commonthreats. It means expanding joint border patrols to theentire Russian-Georgian border  so that no area is leftexposed. Thus the era of zero-sum thinking can bereplaced with policies that lead to a win-win situation.That is my fundamental conviction.Those efforts will require greater sharing ofinformation and intelligence  and a greater degree oftrust ó all of which Georgia stands ready to provide.Why? Because such actions serve the cause of peace;because they are part of what it means to remain aresponsible member of the international community ofnations; and  finally  because we have no reasonablealternative: failure is not an option.In order to replace the mistrust andmisperceptions that sometimes derail our progress Georgia today proposes the establishment of newbilateral bodies to deal with issues between us andRussia  in which bilateral issues and misgivings couldbe regularly discussed and considered. We shouldbegin considering the establishment of such a body sothat our relations never again suffer frommisunderstanding or misinterpretation.16We should  together  consider issues such as theprotection of the rights of Russian citizens now livingin Georgia so that no inhabitant of Georgia ever feelsforgotten or unprotected. At the same time  of course such relations would be based on the principles ofinternational law and mutual respect for each otherísindependence.All this and more is necessary because there isnothing more important than serving the cause ofpeace. And I am confident and optimistic that mycolleague  President Putin  desires the very same forhis people. I believe that Georgia will remain a testcase in our part of the world in the near future as webuild democracy and further advance cooperation.Cooperation among the United States  theEuropean Union  Russia and the countries of theCaucasus must become the litmus test for this newrelationship. Whether it is the fight against terrorism orthe development of energy or of transit and trade lines the region must become a model of cooperation andstability that benefits everybody.We are firmly on the path towards integrating intoregional security structures that serve the stability andsecurity of everybody in the region. Georgia isbecoming an increasingly functional  performing State after being a failed State just one year ago. We nowhave a budget that is three times bigger than it used tobe. Our structures are much more efficient than theyused to be. Our people are more optimistic than theyused to be. We could be a major part of thosestructures  and we offer ourselves as a responsiblemember of the local and international communities. Iam sure that  by following that path  we can unlock thegreat potential of this crucial and great region forpeace  prosperity and stability - a task I look forwardto pursuing with all of Georgia's friends andneighbours."
"64",2617,"GHA",59,2004,"I have the distinct honourto congratulate you  Mr. President  a distinguishedAfrican diplomat  on your election to preside over thefifty-ninth session of this Assembly and to wish yousuccess in your undertaking. I would also like tocommend your predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  for thededication and commitment that he brought to bear onhis stewardship of the fifty-eighth session.Three years ago  a terrible tragedy hit this city.The unprecedented terrorist attacks of 11 Septemberresulted in the death of thousands of innocent people ofmany nationalities  including some from my owncountry  Ghana. The whole world shared the pain andsorrow of New York in the aftermath of thoseatrocities. The whole world also rose in solidarity withthe people of the United States to ensure that suchtragedies would not happen again.11 September reminds us of the importance ofseeking a multilateral and peaceful means for themaintenance of international peace and security especially now  when it has become evident that onlycollective  multilateral efforts will suffice to defeat thenew scourge of mankind  global terrorism.The United Nations has an indispensable role toplay  being the most universal and representativeintergovernmental organization and the best forum forthe practice of multilateralism. However  the success of18multilateralism and collective security will depend onhow the reforms of the United Nations system areimplemented. In this regard  we applaud the initiativeof our illustrious compatriot  Secretary-General KofiAnnan  in setting up the United Nations High-LevelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change  to makeproposals on how the United Nations can best bereformed to meet the new challenges of our world.We  in Africa  agree that the objectives of theUnited Nations reforms  including the revitalization ofthe General Assembly and the reform of the SecurityCouncil  are aimed at enhancing the role of theOrganization and its capacity to overcome currentthreats and emerging challenges. The reforms shouldbe in conformity with the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations Charter and the process must bebased on full consultations in a democratic andtransparent manner. To this end  we look forward to arevitalized General Assembly that would assume itsrightful position as the most authoritative andrepresentative organ of the United Nations.With regard to the Security Council  the Africanposition emphasizes the need to democratize and ensureequitable geographical representation  with Africaallotted no less than two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats in the expanded Security Council.I wish to address the crucial issue of povertyeradication and the promotion of sustainabledevelopment in developing countries in whichwidespread poverty is endemic  particularly in Africa.As we strive to overcome our current economic woes we need the worldís solidarity  resources  technicalknow-how and support. The historic MillenniumSummit of the United Nations  which brought together189 nations in September 2000 and adopted theMillennium Declaration  was a clarion call for action tosolve these problems and set forth the MillenniumDevelopment Goals with measurable goals and targetsfor combating them. On that occasion  the internationalcommunity pledged to spare no effort to free ourfellow men  women and children from the abject anddehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty.Africa has adopted the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  which reaffirms our belief thatAfricans have the primary responsibility to solve theproblems of poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracyafflicting the majority of our population and to stemAfrica's marginalization from global markets. In tandem we are striving to foster political stability  accountableand transparent governance under the rule of law because we believe it is the right thing to do. Ghanahas volunteered as the first country in Africa for theAfrican Peer Review Mechanism  and my Governmentis cooperating with the review panel to facilitate thepreparation of the review report  because we in Ghanacherish very much our democracy and our commitmentof respect for human rights and the rule of law.Our renewed resolve  within the context ofNEPAD  to accelerate the sustainable development ofthe continent  dovetails fully with the avowedcommitment of the international community to helpachieve the Millennium Development Goals. It was therefore  a very welcome and positive developmentwhen the General Assembly  in its resolution 57/7 of4 November 2002  urged the international communityto organize support for African countries within theframework of the principles  objectives and prioritiesof NEPAD. However  for this convergence of visionand effort to yield the desired results  there must begenuine partnership between Africa and theinternational community.The implementation of NEPAD and the creationof institutions such as the Pan-African Parliament  thePeace and Security Council  the Economic  Social andCultural Council  and various commissions of therecently established African Union  reflect Africaísdetermination to be the architect of its own future. Theinitiatives of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States  the West African regional bodycurrently chaired by the President of Ghana  Mr. JohnAgyekum Kufuor  in dealing with the conflicts thathave recently plagued our region are good examples ofthis development. Accra has been the venue forsuccessful peace talks concerning Liberia and  mostrecently  on 29 July 2004  CÙte díIvoire  which hasrevived hopes for a durable peace in that importantWest African country.The important decisions taken at the last summitof the African Union in Addis Ababa have given causefor cautious optimism as the political leadership Governments  the public  civil society and the privatesector now seem to have embarked upon a journey ofcollaborative effort to put an end to conflicts and tofocus instead on the promotion of peace  security andsustainable development for the benefit of the peoplesof the continent.19It is disheartening  though  to observe that despite the good intentions of the internationalcommunity  as exemplified at the various internationalforums that have followed the Millennium Summit there has not been any significant achievement due tothe absence of genuine global partnership fordevelopment. There continues to be an agonizing paradoxbetween the summit and conference declarations of anew global partnership and the persistence of anasymmetrical global system that works largely againstthe interests of developing countries.Quite evidently  the laudable long-term initiativesto halve hunger and poverty by the year 2015 cannot beachieved without a fundamental restructuring of theglobal trade system  particularly in agriculturalproducts. Such an initiative should include developedcountriesí dismantling subsidies and lowering tariffs thereby helping to uphold and safeguard an open equitable  rule-based  predictable  non-discriminatorytrading and financial system. The concerns ofdeveloping countries have been reiterated in thisAssembly over the years; we therefore urge ourdeveloped partners to act now.For many countries in Africa  stable long-termplanning will be impossible without more systematicand sustained debt relief. Despite the progress recordedin the implementation of the enhanced HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and theprovision of substantial debt relief by bilateral officialcreditors  achieving long-term debt sustainability and at the same time  a reduction in poverty as targeted remains a major problem for many African countries.We  therefore  welcome the initiative of British PrimeMinister Tony Blair in setting up the AfricanCommission.Official development assistance (ODA)  as we areaware  continues to play an essential role incomplementing other sources of financing fordevelopment and creating a congenial environment forprivate sector activity. Although ODA flows  whichdecreased in the 1990s  have picked up in recent years the fact that these flows remain  on average  still farbelow internationally agreed targets is a major causefor concern. In this connection  it is pertinent to recallthat an additional $50 billion a year in developmentassistance would be required as a minimum to meet theMillennium Development Goals. The fundamentalquestion facing the international community is whetherit is committed to the indispensable  challenging  butultimately rewarding global partnership  which alonecan make this dream come true.The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a global emergencyand a key threat to achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  especially for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The pandemic has caused untoldsuffering and death in our countries  destroying entirecommunities  reversing development gains and posinga serious security threat.Unfortunately  despite the substantial measurestaken by the Government in combating the scourge Ghanaís efforts have been severely constrained by alack of adequate resources required to prevent newinfections  provide care and support for people particularly women and children living withHIV/AIDS. We wish to urge the internationalcommunity to provide the needed resources for thefight against this global emergency.Ghana attaches great importance to theempowerment of women to make them equal partnersin the formulation and implementation of developmentpolicies. Since the adoption of the Beijing Declarationand Platform for Action and the outcome of thetwenty-third special session of the General Assembly gender equality has been an essential element ofGhanaís efforts to attain sustainable development. Theactive involvement of women in political processes anddecision-making at all levels and in all sectors is beingvigorously pursued. Impediments such as discriminationand violence against women are being dealt withthrough education  advocacy and legislation.Despite the strong political will within theinternational community to create a world fit forchildren  the reality in many parts of the world is a farcry from the ideals voiced at the twenty-seventhspecial session of the General Assembly  on children.We call for the adoption of effective policies toeradicate poverty  to ensure access to education and toprovide families with support to guarantee the well-being of children. Decisive international cooperation isalso required to strengthen legal and other preventivemechanisms to tackle effectively the increasingpractice of child trafficking for unconscionableexploitative purposes.Ghana believes that the staff of the Organization who make sacrifices daily to maintain peace andsecurity in zones of conflict and humanitarian disaster deserve to be provided with a secure and safe20environment in which to operate. In that regard  wewill continue to condemn all attacks against UnitedNations personnel and call for firm action by States toestablish conditions that prevent such attacks  infulfilment of the obligations of host countries towardsthe United Nations and its personnel.Ghana  as a major troop-contributing country will continue to support United Nations peacekeepingoperations globally  as well as in Africa. Thatcommitment  which began with our participation in theUnited Nations Operation in the Congo in 1960  is bornof the firm moral conviction in our solidarity forhumanity and the knowledge that a lack of peace andstability anywhere can be a real threat to peace andsecurity for all of us.In conclusion  I urge Member States to rededicatethemselves individually and collectively to the idealsthat underpin the Organization and provide it with thecommensurate resources as it strives to fulfil theaspirations of the peoples of the world. We cannot should not and must not fail in that undertaking."

While there has been some definite success indefending those values  the world is now facing theeffects and consequences of upheavals that threaten thefoundations of our institution.Three years after the tragic events of11 September 2001  international terrorism continuesto strike out blindly  in an odious manner. The increasein terrorism throughout the world is  for my country  asource of great concern. Through me  the GuineanGovernment reaffirms its resolute condemnation ofterrorism in all its forms and manifestations  andwishes to express its sympathy and solidarity with thevictims of that scourge. My delegation believes that thestruggle against terrorism must continue with greaterresolve  but we must also recognize that we can onlywin the battle if the international communityenergetically attacks the underlying causes of thatscourge  including inequality  poverty and injustice.Given the highly tense international situationwith its many hotbeds of tension throughout the world progress over the last few months in the settlement ofdisputes is a source of satisfaction to us.In West Africa  after many painful years ofinstability  we are happy to note positive achievements thanks to the political will and resolve of its leaders civil society and the international community.In Liberia  there is hope since the transitionalGovernment was established. The deployment of theUnited Nations mission and the progress achieved interms of the disarmament  demobilization andreintegration programme  are all very encouraging. Theconsiderable commitments taken in February at theinternational conference dedicated to the reconstructionof Liberia must be honoured  in order to preserve thepeace that has been restored  and to ensure securitythroughout the subregion.In Sierra Leone  the peace-building processundertaken with the support of the internationalcommunity has shown some commendablesuccesses — the gradual drawdown in the UnitedNations mission troops is being carried out accordingto agreed criteria. Further resources will be necessaryto strengthen the capacity of the security forces so theymay take over from the United Nations Mission inSierra Leone  to reduce unemployment among theyoung  to reintegrate former combatants and to rebuildthe country.In order to promote the momentum of the peaceprocess  the Summit of Heads of State and Governmentof the Mano River — enlarged to include theneighbouring countries of Côte d’Ivoire and Mali —took place on 20 May 2004 in Conakry. The outcome19of the summit shows the political will of our States tostrengthen their cooperation for the consolidation ofpeace and promotion of development in the subregion.I would like to reiterate the appeal that was addressedto the international community to concretely supportthe activities of the Mano River Union.I would also like to renew my country’s appealfor economic  humanitarian and financial assistance sothat we can confront the negative impact of continuingto manage and care for hundreds of thousands ofrefugees and internally displaced persons whileconsolidating our development foundation.I can assure you that the Republic of Guinea willnot fail in its historical duty to safeguard peace  andwill continue to carry out its duties in terms ofsolidarity to populations in distress in the subregion and we will do this on a basis of mutual confidence andrespect for national sovereignty and our commonobligations.In Guinea-Bissau  notable progress enables us tohave hope. We are gratified at the resumption ofcooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions whichwill make it easier to mobilize the required resourcesto build a strong peace.In Côte d’Ivoire  the preservation of unity territorial integrity and the full sovereignty of thecountry must serve as the core of the peace process thatis under way. We appeal to all parties to rely ondialogue in order to overcome the difficulties that lieahead on the way to peace.Guinea is very preoccupied by the persistence ofinterdependent transborder problems that characterizesocio-economic conflicts and crises. Among thoseproblems are the proliferation of and illicit traffic insmall arms and light weapons  the movements ofmercenaries  the recruitment and the use of childsoldiers and the pillaging of natural resources.The initiative for transforming the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)moratorium on export and import of small arms andlight weapons into a regional convention is sound anddeserves the firm support of the internationalcommunity.The Republic of Guinea encourages the Open-Ended Working Group established to negotiate aninternational instrument on small arms and lightweapons to speedily arrive at an agreement ready forimmediate implementation.Like West Africa  the Great Lakes region is onthe road to peace in spite of persistent instability in theeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.It is hoped that  beyond the instability of the transitionperiod  the momentum that exists will enable thatcountry to restore lasting peace and devote its energiesto national reconstruction.My delegation welcomes the deployment of theUnited Nations Operation in Burundi. We urge theinternational community to make greater efforts toconclude the peace process  thus ensuring genuinereconciliation among all citizens of Burundi.Guinea is satisfied to note the progress made onthe question of the Sudan and urges support for theAfrican Union’s efforts for a comprehensive peaceagreement. Nevertheless  we are concerned at thehumanitarian and security situation in Darfur. Weinvite the brotherly Sudanese Government and theparties concerned to spare no effort to reach asettlement to the crisis.Turning to the Horn of Africa  my countrywelcomes the encouraging results of the nationalreconciliation in Somalia. We also hope that Ethiopiaand Eritrea will manage to settle their dispute andrestore peace.The Republic of Guinea is convinced that there isno alternative to a political settlement of the questionof Western Sahara. My country therefore encouragesthe parties to strengthen their cooperation with theSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General inorder to find a just  lasting and mutually acceptablesettlement.The Middle East continues to be the scene ofgrave events arising from the logic of violence thatdiminish day by day the chances of a peacefulsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. Guinea isgreatly concerned at the Israeli Government’s stubborndetermination to continue its construction of the wallof separation in spite of the advisory opinion of theInternational Court of Justice. My country is convincedthat peace in the Middle East greatly depends onobliging all parties to respect their commitments as setout in the Quartet’s road map and the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions. I reaffirm the Guinean people’sfeelings of solidarity and friendship for the brotherly20Palestinian people and their historic leader  PresidentYasser Arafat.My Government remains concerned at thesituation prevailing in Iraq. It hopes that theestablishment of a secure environment will enable theIraqi people to consolidate their sovereignty anddedicate themselves to the reconstruction of theircountry.With respect to the Korean Peninsula  mydelegation urges the parties to continue efforts aimed atthe peaceful and independent reunification of the twoKoreas.I also reaffirm the deep commitment of theGovernment and the people of Guinea to the one-Chinapolicy.Four years ago  the adoption of the MillenniumDeclaration raised hopes for a better life for one billionhuman beings. To that end  my country urges theUnited Nations and the other development partners tocommit themselves fully to contributing to theelimination of poverty by implementing the measuresfor attaining the Goals. Of course  achieving thoseGoals essentially depends on the creation of a globalpartnership for development  in particular in the leastdeveloped countries and the vulnerable segments ofsociety.While it is true that globalization has createdenormous wealth and prosperity in certain regions ofthe world  it must also be noted that the majority of theinhabitants of the world  in particular in the leastdeveloped countries  have not reaped the benefits. Webelieve that a world that provides no opportunities fordevelopment cannot be a world of peace  or even aworld at peace.The Monterrey International Conference onFinancing for Development and the JohannesburgWorld Summit on Sustainable Development  as well asthe recent eleventh session of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development in São Paolo Brazil  and the International AIDS Conference inBangkok  Thailand  provided opportunities to make theneeded commitments. The plans of action adopted atthose conferences should be implemented by alldevelopment actors and at all levels.We believe that the 2005 review ofimplementation of the Millennium Development Goalswill enable us to make necessary adjustments and addthe needed momentum. In that context  my delegationholds that only by increasing official developmentassistance  supported by debt relief and better access tomarkets within the framework of a more fairglobalization  can we overcome the obstacles tosustainable development.With respect to trade  at the present sessionMember States should reaffirm their political will tomove beyond the failed World Trade OrganizationConference at Cancún and conclude negotiationsconcerning the Doha Development Agenda. The recentagreement reached by the General Council of theWorld Trade Organization at Geneva is a beneficialstep in the right direction.Conscious of the importance of all that is at stake the African leaders are more committed than ever totackling the major challenges facing the continent. Theefforts made to achieve the objectives of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) reflectthat awareness. In that context  we appeal again to theinternational community for enhanced support forNEPAD  which steadfastly places Africa on the road tobetter taking charge of its own affairs.Given the many challenges  the Member States ofour Organization have the critical responsibility oftaking action together and individually. Our collectiveresponse  commensurate with all these challenges should be comprehensive  integrated and multilateral.The reform of the United Nations is now morenecessary than ever. I would even say it isindispensable. The restructuring of United Nationsbodies  in particular the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly and the reform of the Security Council  willundoubtedly enhance the efficiency of our collectiveOrganization.My delegation calls for a reformed UnitedNations that is adapted to the new realities of theworld  a United Nations of increased solidarity andtireless efficiency  better able to strengthen peace andstability in the world  for the happiness of our peoples."
"66",2702,"GMB",59,2004,"I should like  Sir  tocongratulate you on your assumption of the presidencyof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Thissession might well prove to be epoch-making in thatthis body will be called upon to consider and to makefar-reaching decisions on what ought to be done torevitalize our Organization and to better align it to fittodayís imperatives for global security  peace anddevelopment. I have no doubt that you will live up toour expectations and that  given your wisdom and vastexperience  you will guide our deliberations to asuccessful outcome. You may rest assured  Mr. President that you will receive my delegationís fullest cooperation.I would also like to take this opportunity to paytribute to your predecessor  the very energetic anddynamic outgoing President  Mr. Julian E. Hunte  whoconducted the business of the fifty-eighth session withgusto  dedication and courage  and who helped us toaddress some difficult issues. My delegation wisheshim all the very best in his future endeavours.To our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  Iexpress my deep appreciation for yet another year ofdedicated service to the Organization ó indeed  tohumanity at large. Some of the problems that were laidbefore him were not easy to resolve but  as expected resolved they were. I hope that his efforts to ensure thetriumph of multilateralism  the resolution of disputesand the pursuit of meaningful cooperation amongnations will be further bolstered during the session thatis just beginning.I stand here representing the young people of theworld. My statement is very long  and is divided intotwo parts: one part will be circulated torepresentatives; I will read out the other part.World leaders have stood at this rostrum on manyoccasions  addressing the world. We made pledges tothe children of the world during the twenty-seventhspecial session ó the childrenís summit ó in 2002.During that special session  we pledged to create abetter world and an environment conducive to thewellbeing of the children of the world. We have alsocome up with objectives for global development so asto make the world a better place for humanity by 2015.So far  there is no indication that those objectives willbe achieved in the next 2 000 years.What are the problems? Since the childreníssummit took place  we have seen the condition of theworldís children become more and more desperate.Children are being butchered throughout the world.Childrenís rights are being violated. Children are beingsold into slavery  and they are being terrorized byadults ó we  who are supposed to take care of them.We have seen the economies of small Statescollapse as a result of rising oil prices. I come from avolatile part of the world  but I do not represent onlyAfrica; I represent the young people of the world  whosefuture is very bleak if the status quo is not addressed.What are the problems of humanity today? Theyare man-made problems  and  because they are man-made  we will be able to resolve them. The solution tothose problems lies with us  human beings óirrespective of race  colour  creed or religion.The problem of development can best besummarized thus: as long as there is violence and as longas there is no peace or global security  we  the poorerparts of humanity  will always become poorer and poorer while the richer nations will become richer and richer.5There cannot be any development without peaceand stability. There cannot be peace or stability withoutdemocracy  justice and equality. The main problem ofhumanity today ó which is creating all our otherproblems - is a result of four human tendencies:greed  double standards  intolerance and hypocrisy.None of us here can look into the faces of ourchildren and assure them of a bright future or of theirsafety. Because of greed  human life has been reducedto naught. People want to become rich at the expenseof human life. Greed can come in many forms. Theinsatiable appetite for world domination andintolerance - those are things that face humanity today.Our problem is not a confrontation between Islamand other religions. The problem of terrorism is ahuman characteristic. No good Muslim would evercommit a terrorist act. But  because the world hasbecome so bad  lawlessness is rampant  and those whowant to take out their frustrations on other humanbeings can do so in the name of Islam or any otherreligion.I have listened to my colleagues who have spokenhere. But  as long as certain issues are not addressed there will be no peace  and the war against terror willbecome an elusive fight that we will always lose.Some of us believe that  because we disapprovedof the war in Iraq in the beginning  it is not ourbusiness to help solve it now. But let me assure theAssembly that the war in Iraq has more far-reachingconsequences for humanity ó and particularly for thechildren whom we pledged to support at the WorldSummit for Children - than for anything else. Wehave seen our economies collapse because of high oilprices that rise higher every day. It is our collectiveresponsibility to put an end to the war in Iraq. We haveseen the rise of global terrorism; the world is a moredangerous place today than during the cold war. Thewar in Iraq ó regardless of whether or not wesupported it ó is a human tragedy  and it is not in ourinterests  as the human race  to let that war continuebecause we disapprove of what has happened. Twowrongs cannot make a right. Even if we believe thatthe war was wrong  it is the responsibility of the entirehuman race to help put an end to the suffering of theIraqi people. We have seen children being butchered inBeslan  Russia; we have seen Palestinian and Israelichildren being butchered. The problem is not areligious problem but a political one  because we  theleaders of the world  want to teach others a lesson bymaking them suffer. That is a human tragedy.We cannot be diplomats here if we want to solvethe worldís problems. It is amazing that  when certainactions that are described as terrorist acts are carriedout by other parties  they are described as retaliationfor something. An unlawful act that destroys humanlife is a terrorist act  regardless of its objective or therationale behind it.If poverty is not addressed  there will bedesperation and hunger. And  if human beings aredesperate  they can resort to actions that are horrific tothe rest of us. We have seen that some parts of theworld are very rich and that other parts - includingAfrica  where I come from - are becoming poorer andpoorer. If the world's wealth is not distributed equally there will be imbalances and inequities  and there willbe people who are desperate. If people are desperate they will do anything to survive.However  that does not mean that one can justifyviolence. I do not justify violence in any form  becauseI believe that peace and stability would augur well forour children. The fight against terror is global. Let usbe mindful of the consequences of allowing terror to beseen as a legitimate act.We have seen double standards being appliedwhen resolutions are adopted for the good of humanityby the international community ó which is representedhere ó and  in some cases  are enforced to the letter whereas a few States are above international law andUnited Nations resolutions.That brings me to the issue of nuclear weapons.As a human being and as a peacemaker  I believe that following the end of the cold war  no nation shouldhave been able to justify the possession of nuclearweapons  much less become a new nuclear Power. Ifpowerful nations continue to keep their nuclearweapons - and there are many double standards in theway we deal with one another ó that will only becomean enticement for others to opt for nuclear weaponsbecause they think such weapons will serve as aninsurance policy against attacks.I know that  during the 1980s  there was acampaign to promote nuclear disarmament. Today  inthe new millennium  that campaign should bestrengthened through a United Nations resolutionmaking it illegal for anyone to possess nuclear6weapons. We have seen conflicts simmering that willhave drastic consequences for humanity - conflictsaimed at preventing certain States from acquiringnuclear weapons. Now that the Soviet empire no longerexists  all nuclear weapons - whether they arepossessed by the Gambia or by any other country -should be eliminated. Just imagine one bomb killingmillions of people. And here we stand  telling everyonethat the world will be a better place for mankind. I believein the peaceful resolution of all conflicts. Indeed  as faras I know  there is no licensing authority for thepossession of nuclear weapons; therefore  no one candecide who should and who should not have them.We should take a bold step to ensure that no onehas nuclear weapons. In this forum  on behalf of theworldís children  I appeal to those who aspire topossess nuclear weapons that that is the wrong path totake. Peace and stability cannot be ensured through thepossession of nuclear weapons. The strength of anation is not based on its firepower or its nucleararsenal  but is determined by its ability to make theworld a better place for humanity  including its owncitizens. Nuclear weapons are not a solution."
"67",2742,"GNB",59,2004,"Thirty years ago  my country attained itsnational sovereignty. Indeed  it was on 17 September1974 that the young Republic of Guinea-Bissau wasadmitted to the United Nations as a full-fledgedMember State. Three decades  to be sure  is a shorttime in terms of nation-building. But it is a long time ifyou consider that in most African countries  includingmy own  life expectancy does not exceed 50 years.That bitter reality is the true measure of the time thathas elapsed and of what my country has achieved sinceindependence. Hence  for us in Guinea-Bissau  this isan important time for reflection  indeed forintrospection  in the light of recent events and of thesuccessive crises we have confronted of late.I address the Assembly today as the transitionalPresident of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.Addressing the Assembly gives me particular pleasure Sir  because you - Mr. Jean Ping  the outstandingMinister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs ofthe brotherly and friendly Gabonese Republic - arepresiding over the Assembly's work with the skill experience and talent we all know so well.We have come to New York in search of newideas for innovative and resolute action  ideas that willaffect the way we think and will have a positive impacton our joint efforts to create a new world of peace freedom and social justice for all countries and peoplesrepresented here.It was with great attention and interest that welistened to the outstanding statement made here twodays ago by Secretary-General Kofi Annan (see). His observations were thought-provoking.For our part  we share his vision of the world as it istoday and as it should be tomorrow. Above all  weappreciate his dedication and determination at the headof the Organization  whose irreplaceable role isincreasingly evident throughout the world.We live today in a world of ever more strikingcontrasts  imbalances  contradictions and inequalities.On the one hand  we are witness to increasinglymarvellous scientific and technological progress  fromwhich certain countries benefit greatly. On the other2hand  hundreds of millions of people continue to liveprecarious lives and to suffer from malnutrition andendemic disease. This situation is not only inhumanand immoral  it is dangerous. It is sowing all the seedsthat provoke frustration and despair  fuel rancour andhatred and lead to irrational behaviour and to actionsendangering peace and international security.Combating poverty and epidemics such asHIV/AIDS throughout the world does not mean kindnessor charity; it is common sense that requires that togetherwe mobilize our actions to combat those scourges. I amgratified by the initiative of certain heads of State ó inparticular  President Lula da Silva - in recalling toeach of us our responsibilities in the fight to eradicatehunger and destitution in a world as interdependent asthe one in which we live today. It is critical here tounderstand that there is an urgent need to act  and toact properly. Above all  let us not wait for more reportsor analyses to be submitted to us first  regardless ofhow visionary or relevant they may be. Thousands ofwomen  children and infants die every day becausethey lack a pill or a vaccination. That is unjust; that isimmoral.We must pool our efforts to establish moreequitable relations among States. International trademust be better regulated  just as globalization and itseffects on the world economy must be bettercontrolled  to allow for a more equitable distribution ofthe riches of the world. Rather than leaving theunderdeveloped countries to suffer from the effects ofglobalization  let us create for them the conditionsnecessary for their integration into the process  whichis utterly beyond their control and whose socialdimension must be the subject of specific measures soas to mitigate negative consequences.Today it is clear to everyone that to ensure peacethroughout the world there is a need to promote thedevelopment of the poorest countries and to improvethe living conditions of populations  in particular byguaranteeing them access to drinking water  health andeducation - especially for girls. Above all there is aneed to create a social and political environment that isstable and is likely to release that creative energy ofeach and every individual and to promote theparticipation of all citizens in the management of theaffairs of State of their country.The rights of each and every person must berespected  and all liberties provided by the law must beguaranteed without any impediment. The rule of lawmust be consolidated to allow each institution tofunction properly and effectively. I am thinking inparticular of justice  which must be able to act with fullindependence and with scrupulous respect for theseparation of executive  legislative and judicial powers.Guinea-Bissau  unfortunately  has not escapedfrom the cycle of violence and political crisis thatseems today to have become a prerogative of theAfrican countries. Our country has recently sufferedfrom the disastrous consequences of an economicpolicy that is poorly adapted to the real needs of thepopulation. The domestic conflict we have beenexperiencing in Guinea-Bissau since 1998 could havebeen avoided. It has further impoverished a countrythat is among the least developed countries and whereeverything must still be built because nothing couldresist destruction. We are aware of the seriousness ofthe situation and of the need to pool our efforts to makethe necessary changes  which our people have a right toexpect from their leaders.Our people have suffered too much and for toolong and have made too many sacrifices. We mustcreate new conditions that provide reasons for hope.We have successfully initiated national dialogue basedon mutual respect and taking into account the nationalinterest. We have created a new culture of peace basedon our affiliation with one single country with all itsdiversity and social and cultural riches. We havedecided to make democracy an immutable reality.However  we are aware that democracy is noteasy to build in a poor country where the illiteracy rateis still high and where the fundamental infrastructure isstill severely lacking. Nevertheless  we continue to beinspired by the courage of our people and by thesupport of other countries ó those of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)  theUnion …conomique et MonÈtaire Ouest-africaine(UEMOA) and the Community of Portuguese-speakingCountries in particular ó and the European Union China and the rest of the international community.Thus last March we were able to organize legislativeelections that the international community consideredjust and credible and to establish a new parliament  therole of which is fundamental in any democracy. Wewill also be organizing presidential elections in April2005  as agreed in the Charter of Transition  thusallowing for the restoration of constitutional order.3Guinea-Bissau needs the assistance of theinternational community to meet the many enormouschallenges confronting it. That assistance is urgent andimportant. We have created mechanisms for therigorous control of State revenues and expendituresand  with the assistance of the UNDP and the BrettonWoods institutions in particular  all the necessaryconditions for the transparent management of publicproperty  which allows us to combat corruption.To enable us to relaunch our economy rapidly  weare planning to hold a round table in December. Wehope that India  Brazil and South Africa will beassisting us in that initiative to combat poverty andhelping us in the organization we have created in ourcountry.We have here a great opportunity to express ourgratitude for the commitment and dynamic action ofthe Economic and Social Councilís Ad Hoc AdvisoryGroup on Guinea-Bissau and its partners  anindispensable instrument for advancing constructivedialogue between Guinea-Bissau and its partners fordevelopment  including the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund. I should like to thankthem from this rostrum for their continued support. So too  we wish to reaffirm our great appreciation for themembers of the Security Council who visited ourcountry last June and showed their great interest in it.For the maintenance of international peace andsecurity Guinea-Bissau  speaking before the greatmajority of the Members of the Organization  hopesthat the Security Councilís part will be strengthened byenhancing its membership to better reflect the worldsituation. From this rostrum  I would like to say howgrateful we are to those who supported us in the firstphase of our transition.Humanity is one and indivisible. The men andwomen who inhabit our planet share the sameaspirations: peace and well-being. Every individual whatever the continent he belongs to  feels the samefrustration when confronting injustice  impunity andviolations of the rights of the human being. There isnot a single child who does not feel the need to beloved and protected by his or her parents and who doesnot hope to grow up in a home where peace and lovereign. How can we protect them if nothing is done toguarantee the rights of women and give a suitableeducation to young women? How can we prevent themother  and the child she brings into the world becoming victims of an endemic illness such as AIDS tuberculosis or malaria at a time when most poorcountries are incapable of providing basic health care?Tomorrowís world is being built today. Thanks tothe awareness of the real challenges  in this planetaryvillage in which we all live  with its advantages and itsproblems  our human condition must be the commondenominator on which and around which all people ofgood will should come together in order to make ourworld more fair  more tolerant and based more onsolidarity.Whether we are discussing crises in Africa or inthe Middle East  or the fight against terrorism - afight that requires us all to mobilize our efforts - wemust be animated by the same determination to seeklasting solutions based on consensus.The peoples we represent expect us to takeconcrete actions. They hope that we will be able toovercome our differences and pool our efforts so as torespond to their most urgent needs. Many praiseworthyinitiatives to eradicate hunger  poverty  malnutritionand illiteracy have been undertaken. We must involvenon-governmental organizations and other elements ofcivil society. In other words  we must appeal to allpeople of goodwill.The nations of the world all share the planetEarth  on which we all live. It is our responsibility toprotect it so that we can provide our children and ourchildrenís children with the conditions for a healthylife lived in dignity.Environmental protection alone is not enough.We must also create a climate of peace throughout theworld. That cannot be done without the help of eachMember State: it must be a collective effort in whichdialogue and agreement take precedence and where therule of law prevails in international relations. None ofour peoples can live in isolation in the self-reliantmanner of the past. The interdependence of the globaleconomy is now a reality for all of us. Let us takeadvantage of the resources of the Earth withoutabusing our ecosystems  because the future of theplanet depends on our capacity to think in terms of thecollective interest. Let us act in a spirit of humanismand solidarity whenever the poorest of the poorconfront calamity and natural disasters - disasterssuch as those that have recently afflicted Haiti  theDominican Republic and other Caribbean countries.4Let us understand the true dimension andmeaning of the spiritual force that resides in eachhuman being - a force to which we can turn at timesof doubt and discouragement in order to regain the willand the energy we need to overcome our challenges."
"68",2781,"GNQ",59,2004,"Although protocol requires that our statements be brief it is no matter of routine for Equatorial Guinea tocongratulate Mr. Jean Ping  Minister of Foreign Affairsof the Gabonese Republic  on his well-deservedelection to guide the work of the General Assembly atits fifty-ninth regular session.We congratulate you  Mr. President  because first  it is right that the voice of the oppressed andmarginalized that you represent should be heard loudand clear by the international community. Secondly  wewould like also to encourage you  because the taskfacing you personally and your country  the GaboneseRepublic  is to coordinate — and to endeavour toreconcile — the varied and opposing interests that existin this unipolar  artificial and fragile world  where fewspeak out  others say nothing or only listen  and yetothers speak  but to no effect.The task is difficult  because we need to rebuildthe international authority that has been taken awayfrom the United Nations. We can do this only if there isa spirit of honesty  individual and collectiveresponsibility  and goodwill on the part of MemberStates  so that selfish interests can be put aside in thecommon fight to ensure the primacy of the principlesand objectives of this world Organization  which arepositive and universal.Mr. President  you will always be able to counton the support and ongoing cooperation of my country the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  in ensuring thatyour work is fruitful and benefits humankind.We express our eternal gratitude to Mr. KofiAnnan  Secretary-General of this Organization  who atall times has been equal to the circumstances and whohas dealt with caution  impartiality and justice with theissues that have come to the attention of theOrganization over the course of this year. We reiterateour confidence in him and assure him of ourcooperation in the task of strengthening the role of theUnited Nations.Equatorial Guinea is participating in the work ofthe General Assembly at this session with deep concernbecause of the dangers and threats posed by themethods used by more powerful countries inintervening in the affairs of less protected nations  suchas my own. We believe that the United Nations has stillnot fulfilled its primary objective of guaranteeinginternational peace and security. We are living in timesof serious upheaval in various parts of the world brought about by the anarchy that currentlycharacterizes international relations.Equatorial Guinea will join its efforts with thoseof the international community in order to strengthenthe international authority of the United Nations.We have come to the United Nations to statepublicly that Equatorial Guinea is under threat. We saythis out loud  and we hope that we will truly be heard because we know that complaints by weaker Stateshave often fallen on deaf ears in this forum when theinterests of the strongest are at stake.Equatorial Guinea is facing a serious threat  andwe ask the United Nations to take serious  committedmeasures  not only with regard to the issues affectingEquatorial Guinea today but also in order to prevent41other countries in the same situation as ours from beingvictimized by the same sort of conspiracy in future.Indeed  my country is being threatened by theincessant and poisonous campaign of defamationagainst my Government that has been orchestrated bypressure groups and by the press of certain countries —saying that we in Equatorial Guinea do not respecthuman rights  calling my Government a dictatorship  aswell as accusing us of squandering oil revenues. Thatcampaign has as its only objective the justification ofan absurd intervention by force in EquatorialGuinea — the failed multinational mercenary invasionthat was to have taken place on 6 March last.The international community is aware of theevents connected to that aborted plan thanks to pressreports on the trials  held simultaneously in EquatorialGuinea and in Zimbabwe  of those mercenaries whowere arrested in Malabo and in Harare  respectively.Indeed  and under the pretext of supporting thepolitical claims of a supposed opposition leader inexile in Spain  a number of mercenaries  of variousnationalities but with a common leadership  acquired acargo plane with the goal of transporting to Malabo  inthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea  65 trained  armedmen who were to take part in an invasion — a suicideoperation. They planned to occupy previouslyidentified strategic areas  in order physically to removethe President of the Republic  members of theGovernment and anyone who opposed them.The invasion  planned for the night of 7 March2004  would have represented the implementation of anelaborate plan  hatched  elaborated and perfected byanother group of 18 men  who had obtained a license tofly cargo and passenger planes in Equatorial Guinea using the facilities provided by the Government. Thatgroup was to join up with those coming from Harare.The support that they received from Spain was toinvolve the use of two Spanish Navy warships with 500sailors on board  for support in case of resistance. Thegoal was to put in power  at Government headquarters Mr. Severo Moto Nsa  who had formed a governmentin exile that was recognized by the previousGovernment of Spain.Fortunately  the solidarity of the Governments ofAngola  Zimbabwe and South Africa came into playand they alerted the security services of my country which acted immediately  arresting  on the night of 6March  the 18 men stationed in Malabo  while theHarare Government did the same with those found inthat capital’s airport on 7 March 2004.The mercenaries themselves  in public statementsduring the trials held in Malabo and in Harare explained the plan’s objectives and named the peopleinvolved. They also gave details on the financing of thepurchase of arms and of the cargo plane  and on theoffer of the Spanish ships  which were already  at thattime  anchored in the territorial waters of EquatorialGuinea.The Secretary-General  as well as the Members ofthis Organization  should know that  a month beforethose events  my Government had rejected anddenounced the sending of those warships to EquatorialGuinea in a note to the Spanish Government  which atthe time was using as a pretext its support for theGovernment of Equatorial Guinea in the conflictrelated to its claim of sovereignty over the island ofMbañie. This General Assembly can  I am sure understand the danger and the loss of human life thatthis invasion would have caused if it had succeeded.We know that Equatorial Guinea is a victim forthe sole reason that it has respected the principles andexercised the fundamental rights of a sovereign State which are the exercise of sovereignty by the people non-interference in the internal affairs of othercountries and the right to the exclusive use of theresources that nature has given it. If this is so  wewould like the Assembly to reply to the followingquestions  if possible.Why are so many negative things currently beingsaid about Equatorial Guinea in foreign circles  whenthe country’s people themselves live in peace and thereare no demands being made by the populace or fromthe people’s representative bodies?Why this talk of dictatorship and oppression inEquatorial Guinea  when the administration in powerhas re-established political freedom in the country with 13 political parties in a country of barely onemillion people?Can a dictatorship based on oppression allowfreedom such as the current level of foreign investmentand the arrival of more than seventeen internationalflights per week to such a small country as EquatorialGuinea?42Is there an international police force that has theauthority to tell Equatorial Guinea how to use itseconomic resources  when we already have anadministrative and political organization for managingour resources with transparency? Can a country thatdoes not use its resources for the benefit of the peopleapprove an annual budget  through parliament  of 618billion CFA francs as a justifiable public cost?Is it true that the only way to end the abuseallegedly committed by Equatorial Guinea would be toorganize the kind of terrorist and mercenary invasiontargeted at eliminating innocent people that wasplanned on 6 March 2004?Equatorial Guinea would like to know whetherthis mercenary system is supported by the internationalcommunity. If it is supported  which countries areresponsible for this crime? We do not believe that thereis any difference between the terrorism that wecondemn today and the terrorist acts committed bymercenaries in various parts of the world.Equatorial Guinea is seriously under threat. Wesay this because we know from reliable sources thatour enemies will not forgive the embarrassment anddefeat caused by the failure of the mercenary invasionon 6 March. However  this does not mean thatEquatorial Guinea is going to drop its arms or fall onits knees and let the enemy do with it what it will. Webelieve that the United Nations responsibility is tomaintain peace and international security and to avoida merciless war between countries.We would like to affirm that there are countrieswho are Members of this global Organization represented in this hemicycle  whose security agencieswere informed of this devilish plan  and who  unlikeAngola  South Africa and Zimbabwe  who expressedtheir solidarity  simply kept silent  waiting for events tounfold. But we ask you to leave us in peace  becauseEquatorial Guinea is a peaceful country and we do notthink that we have offended anyone.A detailed analysis of the situation has shown usthat the end of the cold war has not actually led to theunification of humanity and the integration of theworld as we had hoped. Rather  it has rekindled selfishand perverse feelings among those who have alwaysdominated — or have always wanted to dominate —the world. The phenomenon of mercenaries  therefore is a classic practice of States’ piracy  politically dressedup and falsely justified by political  economic andhumanitarian interests. This is why we continue to seethis defamatory campaign  to justify a possibleinvasion.Nevertheless  Equatorial Guinea does not need toplease the international community with propagandaregarding our development. Our only judge and arbiteris our own people  to which our State institutions mustjustify their actions. This tactic of creating a falsifiednegative image of a State is of no surprise to anybodyat the moment  and it should least of all be a surprise tothis world Organization.We also see that the theory of a globalized worldis a fallacy  because  as we very often say  you cannotcall a dog to you while holding a stick to beat it. Wecannot accept globalization when the concept ofcolonialism  the superiority of some peoples overothers or even of neo-colonialism still exists.Globalization is in contradiction with the concept ofthe superiority of some over others. Globalization doesnot mean exclusion as opposed to integration andcooperation. Finally  globalization does not meanpower relations such as those that some would like toimpose.The situation in Equatorial Guinea affects othercountries of Central Africa as well  as the terroriststhemselves have declared. We know that themercenaries have acted in other parts of the world  andwe bring this to the General Assembly because of thedestructive effects that have been seen in other affectedcountries. We feel that solidarity among African Statesand the third world in general is absolutelyindispensable  because we are the direct victims ofthose who are ordering these mercenary acts.In conclusion  we must stop looking backwards.The current breakdown of the forces of peace independence and the sovereignty of States  as theantithesis to the major wars of the past century  showsus that we are close to unleashing a universalholocaust. The situation today is that the weakest andmost needy are ignored and marginalized. We have toput a stop to this race to chaos and build a world that ismore respectful of the human race."
"69",2827,"GRC",59,2004,"Mr. President  I wouldlike to begin by congratulating you upon your electionto your challenging office. Under your able guidance the Assembly will take forward its relentless pursuit ofpeace  security and prosperity throughout the world. Ican assure you of Greece’s unwavering support in yourefforts. Our thanks go also to the outgoing president Mr. Julian Hunte  for his exemplary efforts andachievements in revitalizing the work of the GeneralAssembly  as well as on many other issues.The Greek Government fully subscribes to thestatement delivered two days ago by the ForeignMinister of the Netherlands on behalf of the EuropeanUnion (EU) (see )  as well as to the EUpriorities presented to this General Assembly.At the beginning of the twenty-first century events of great importance changed the world we livein. From the most shocking tragedy of 11 September2001 to the bombing attacks in Madrid and the recentacts of unspeakable brutality in Beslan  a dark paradeof acts of blind violence has caused immense humansuffering.This has increased our responsibility and cementedour will to work in solidarity for a safer  fairer world.Fighting international terrorism has become the mostpressing task among our priorities. In that fight  wemust prevail. Besides the scourge of terrorism however  there are many other challenges and graveproblems that afflict humanity. The proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  human trafficking organized crime  failing States  environmentalcatastrophes  social and economic crises  pandemicdiseases  large-scale humanitarian disasters  hungerand poverty constitute the core problems we have toface in solidarity regardless of our geography  cultureor religion.Last year  the Secretary-General announced thecreation of a High-Level Panel of eminent persons toassess the new threats and challenges and to suggestways to deal with them  including through reform ofthe multilateral international system. We fully supportthose efforts. We are eager to contribute constructively to the best of our ability  towards making the UnitedNations as effective as possible for the twenty-firstcentury.(spoke in French)The major challenges and threats confronting usare a source of profound concern — for us and for thepeoples we represent. Nonetheless  it is my convictionthat  at any cost  we must avoid being drawn intopessimism and anxiety about the future. I share withmillions of people worldwide the hope  optimism anddetermination that were recently seen during theOlympic and Paralympic Games in Athens.In Athens  athletes of the world devoted theirefforts to a noble cause and showed us that competitiondoes not necessarily mean tension  friction  crisis orconflict. To the contrary  they proved that theaspirations of all sides can not only coexist peacefullybut can also lead to a strengthening of friendship solidarity and cooperation among individuals andnations.The ancient ideal of the Olympic Truce embodiesmodern humanity’s hope for the peaceful settlement ofthe conflicts ravaging the world. The GeneralAssembly has  on many occasions  unanimouslyendorsed the Olympic Truce and has appealed toMember States to respect it during the Games. It isnow a question of transforming that appeal into atangible reality.(spoke in English)Multilateral cooperation is the safest way to abetter world. We all should contribute to theenhancement and effectiveness of the internationalmultilateral system. In that context  Greece fully sharesthe view of the Secretary-General that we have to25move rapidly from the existing culture of reaction toone of prevention.The peaceful resolution of all disputes at an earlystage  on the basis of the United Nations Charter  is offundamental importance to my country. We stronglybelieve that the United Nations system of conflictprevention and its preventive potential should befurther enhanced to respond better to future challenges.Peace and development are two mutuallyreinforcing sides of the same coin. Persistent povertycheats nations out of progress and provides a breedingground for both internal and regional crises. Four yearsago  with the adoption of the Millennium Declaration a landmark decision was taken to embark upon long-term global evolution. We committed ourselves toachieve by the year 2015 the Goals that were set. Itwould be a disgrace to mankind if we did not succeedin bringing about stable and sustainable developmentand in eradicating hunger and poverty.However  there are growing indications that despite some progress  we are lagging in fulfillingagreed targets. Collectively  we have to explore new innovative ways of financing development. Particularattention should be paid to the development problemsof Africa and of small island States.In line with the Millennium Declaration  anddespite the enormous outlay of resources necessary tofinance the Olympic Games and their security  Greecehas made a point of increasing its developmentassistance.In the context of that effort  Greece welcomes theproposals to combat hunger and poverty made by thePresident of Brazil and co-sponsored by France  Chile Argentina and Spain. We shall continue to worktowards a constructive and effective system that willallow smooth cooperation between recipients anddonors and between developing and developedcountries.A close look at Greece’s immediateneighbourhood reveals that  despite the considerableprogress made over the last few years  the situationstill remains fragile in parts of the western Balkans.Unemployment and the lack of economic prospects arein some cases a social and political time bomb. Thesituation in Kosovo remains a source of instability.With the proactive support and involvement ofthe international community  we are working hard totransform the Balkans into a region of democracy  peace stability and prosperity  focused on a common Europeanfuture. We believe that genuinely regional initiativessuch as the South-East European Cooperation Processconstitute the appropriate vehicle to enableparticipating countries to coordinate their effortstowards reform  progress and good neighbourliness.In recent years  the climate of our bilateralrelations with Turkey has been constantly improving.Both the Greek and the Turkish Governments haveundertaken sincere efforts to set bilateral relations on anew track. We note with satisfaction the progressachieved so far in certain areas of our bilateralcooperation and express our determination to expand itfurther. It is in that spirit that we clearly supportTurkey’s European perspective.In Cyprus  reunification remains our unwaveringgoal through a mutually agreed  lasting  fair andfunctional settlement  based on the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions and the plan of the Secretary-General and compatible with the European UnionCommunity acquis and European Union principles.During the last 30 years of military occupation ofmore than one third of the territory of Cyprus  Greecehas strongly supported every attempt and initiative bythe United Nations  including the most recent one  forthe achievement of a just  viable and functionalsolution of the Cyprus problem. Unfortunately  the lastround of talks did not lead to an agreed comprehensivesolution. In the referendum  which followed in April an overwhelming majority of Greek Cypriots rejected aspecific version of the Annan plan  but they still deeplycherish the goal of a reunited island.The international community can contributedecisively in that direction by keeping the window fora solution open and by avoiding any action whichcould lead to the deepening of the division of the islandor could fail to provide incentives for its reunification.The horizon over the Middle East remains dark.The Greek Government is convinced that only theimplementation of the road map can lead to the two-State solution: Israel and Palestine coexisting in peaceand security. Half measures can only complicatematters and add new sources of tension. Essentialprogress in the peace process cannot be achievedwithout a comprehensive cessation of all kinds ofviolence  especially violence directed against civilians.Terrorism cannot be a weapon to achieve political26goals  and terrorist attacks cannot be justified by anymeans.As to Iraq  we are deeply committed to theterritorial integrity and unity of the country in a federalsystem. We are deeply worried by the ongoing violence and we hope for progress in the political process  whichwill lead to a stable and prosperous democraticcountry  allowing all of its citizens to enjoy the fruitsof peace and exploit the country’s enormous potential.(spoke in French)In the light of the great challenges on the Africancontinent  we note with great satisfaction thededication shown and the results achieved by theAfrican Union  an organization that is only 3 years old.Greece and its European partners want to help to improveAfrica’s prospects through development assistance humanitarian assistance and logistical support.Moreover  we support the prospect of strengthenedpolitical cooperation with African countries and withthe continent’s regional organizations.I take this opportunity to express thecongratulations of my Government and of the Greekpeople on the tenth anniversary of the establishment ofdemocracy in the Republic of South Africa  a historicevent of pan-African significance.(spoke in English)My country has applied for a non-permanent seaton the Security Council for the period 2005-2006. Iwish to express our deep appreciation to the membersof the Group of Western European and other States fortheir endorsement. Elections are taking place in a fewweeks’ time. We are asking for the support of theAssembly  which we would greatly appreciate. Let meassure Members that we shall respect its mandate andthat we remain strongly committed to contributingconstructively to the maintenance of peace and securityand to the preservation of the multilateral order.Greece remains completely devoted to thepromotion of democratic principles of government  thepeaceful resolution of disputes  strict adherence tointernational law and respect for human rights. We aredetermined  should we be elected  to devote all ourefforts and all our capacity to fulfilling thatresponsibility and honouring the trust of this Assemblyof all nations."
"70",2868,"GRD",59,2004,"My delegation joins inthe many laudatory and congratulatory expressionsaddressed to you  Mr. Ping  as you assume thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession. Additionally  we pay tribute to yourpredecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  whose presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session was virile dynamic and constructive  imbued  as he was  with thewisdom of Solomon  the patience of Job and the visionof Daniel.Grenada’s statement is made from the profounddepths of the human heart. The Prime Minister ofGrenada  The Right Honourable Keith Mitchell  andthe Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade The Honourable Elvin Nimrod  whose unavoidableabsence can be understood  have asked me to speak ontheir behalf.The Assembly will  I hope  understand whyGrenada’s statement in this general debate will focus inlarge measure on the natural disaster that has befallenthe State of Grenada  Carriacou and Petite Martinique.First  Grenada expresses grateful appreciation for theoutpouring of sympathy and assistance from the manycountries that have already taken the rostrum —especially from the Caribbean leaders who have seenand described to the Assembly  in chilling and heart-rending detail  the devastation of the tri-island State ofGrenada  Carriacou and Petite Martinique caused byjurricane Ivan “the Terrible”.Therefore  there is no need for me to multiply mywords except to say that the fickle finger of fateseemed to have conspired with nature — exceedinglybenevolent at times  but sometimes equally destructive.This time  it released its full fury on a vulnerable smallisland developing State  reducing it to rubble. Afterhurricane Ivan’s rage had subsided  there was completedestruction of the infrastructure  and it seemed as if aStygian darkness had descended on the land. However the resilience of our people and the emerging solidaritygive us hope that  with the assistance of theinternational community  Grenada — like themythological phoenix — will rise from the ashesbrought about by the hurricane.Who can help us pick up the pieces of a shatteredcountry with a dislocated economy  whose precipitousdecline has brought it to rock bottom? An assessmentof the destruction reveals that it would take $2 billionto rebuild the State of Grenada  Carriacou and PetiteMartinique. That is a Herculean task far beyond ourmeans. The call  therefore  is made to the internationalcommunity: “Come down to Macedonia and help us”.We plead with the United Nations  its agencies theUnited Nations Development Programme  UNICEF UNESCO  the World Bank  the International MonetaryFund  the Food and Agriculture Organization of theUnited Nations  the World Health Organization individual countries  individual permanentrepresentatives  non-governmental organizations andfriends to help Grenada help itself.In that connection  my delegation recalls thewords of the seventeenth-century English clergymanand poet John Donne: “No man is an island  entire ofitself; every man is a piece of the continent  a part ofthe main.” Thus  what happens to each of us affects allof us. Today  that is eminently borne out by theinterconnectivity and interdependence of societies aided by the information and communicationtechnology revolution. Consequently  we speak todayabout a world shared by all instead of a world divided.Giving  caring and sharing should therefore be areality  not just a concept.Forgiving Grenada’s debt and cancelling itsobligations to international organizations andinstitutions will give Grenada a breathing spell. Help in17that regard will be formally requested through officialchannels and will free Grenada of its many obligations.The dire problems of my countrynotwithstanding  we cannot fail to touch upon theworld situation  in which the geopolitical centre ofgravity continues to swing from the Israeli-Palestinianstruggle to Iraq and Afghanistan. The situation in thosecentres of conflict is fanned further by the heinous andatrocious crime of terrorism  which is fast becoming away of life. In that regard  my delegation recalls anancient law: hatreds never cease by hatreds; it is bylove alone that they cease.It will be recalled that  from this rostrum  I toldmy colleagues that I would demit office at the end ofthis month  having attained the ripe old age of 84 yearsand having served my country in this honourable bodyfor almost 13 years. Today  I want to recant with regardto that diplomatic note on my premature departure andto tell the Assembly that my Government has asked meto continue. Therefore  refreshed in body and mind confident in faith and joyful in hope  I will continue toexpect the generous assistance of my colleagues.With respect to my age  I should like to quote SirFrancis Bacon  who wrote several centuries ago thatage appears to be best in four things: old wood best toburn  old wine to drink  old friends to trust and oldauthors to read. Colleagues  I treasure your friendshipand ask for your support on behalf of my country.Let me conclude with this patriotic verse:To all the world I give my hand My heart I give my native land;I seek her good  her glory.I honour every nation’s name Respect their fortune and their fame;But I love the land that bore me!Love the land that bore me!Please allow me an addendum to my statement. Iwish to announce that tomorrow  Friday  at 10.30 a.m.in the Economic and Social Council Chamber  theOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairsand the United Nations Development Programme willmake a flash appeal for assistance to Grenada andHaiti."
"71",2915,"GTM",59,2004,"I wouldlike to begin by expressing our appreciation toMr. Julian Hunte  Minister for Foreign Affairs of SaintLucia  for his accomplished and skilful leadership ofthe General Assembly during its previous session.I would also like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits fifty-ninth session.I would also like to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the great wisdom that hehas shown in the discharge of his functions. Hedeserves our respect and appreciation  and we extendto him our support and solidarity.My country has reached a crucial point in itshistory. It faces the challenge of living up to theexpectations raised by the end of the internal armedconflict. Since January  when I assumed office  thefrustrated hopes of all of our people have beenrekindled.My plan of government is predicated on the peaceagreements and defines their implementation as acommitment of the whole nation. As President of11Guatemala  I endorse fully the principle that a firm andlasting peace must be based on participatory socio-economic development  aimed at achieving thecommon good and responding to the needs of all of ourpeople  particularly those still living in extremepoverty.Since I took office  I have made a point oflistening to the opinions of all of our citizens. That hasenabled me to identify the constraints facingGuatemala  which it must overcome if it is to dealadequately with the many legitimate social demandsand expectations.The actions that my Government intends to takein the period 2004 to 2008 will focus on four areas:social investment; conditions of production;environmental sustainability; and security for all.Those policies are being carried out within theframework of the principles of solidarity andinclusiveness; decentralization and participation; andtransparency in public actions. Those areas of actionand principles accord fully with the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.I would like to single out a number ofachievements resulting from our new approach togovernment. We have reduced our troop strength by43 per cent and have begun to modernize the armedforces and to make them more professional  consistentwith the functions that they are required to perform intime of peace. This includes  at the international level greater participation by the Guatemalan army in UnitedNations peace operations  for example in Haiti.In terms of public spending  we are accordingpriority to education  health  security  citizenship andinfrastructure.We are fighting petty crime  gang-related crimeand organized crime  focusing in particular oncombating drug trafficking  terrorism  smuggling money laundering  trafficking in persons and the illegalarms trade  all of which represent a huge challenge thatcannot be overcome without the support of theinternational community.We are waging an all-out war against corruption and creating mechanisms to ensure transparency inpublic procurement and contracting. For the first timein the history of our country  charges of corruption arebeing investigated  and those found guilty will beprosecuted.We have adopted a series of measures aimed atelaborating and implementing a fiscal pact. Sustainedefforts are being made to meet the taxation goals setout in the peace agreements  within the framework ofmy Government’s objectives for economic growth.We have  as a matter of priority  established anational front against hunger and malnutrition.Working with civil society  we have elaborated a policyon food and nutritional security.We have consolidated our responsible approachto macroeconomic management; that is necessary if weare to promote competitiveness and productiveinvestment and ensure the well-being of allGuatemalans. In this context  we launched aprogramme for economic and social recovery  entitledVamos Guatemala.We have taken firm measures to eliminateextreme poverty and reduce social exclusion  whilefully respecting our diversity — for Guatemala is amulti-ethnic  multicultural and multilingual country.My Government is committed to full respect forhuman rights. We believe that every Guatemalanshould enjoy basic rights and fundamental freedoms and that the right to development must be ensured. Inthis context  Guatemala will cooperate withinternational bodies that promote and protect humanrights.My Government’s foreign policy is consistentwith its national interests. Our guiding principle is theneed to ensure that Guatemala can take its proper placein today’s globalized world  as well as to strengthenmultilateralism and regional integration.The presidents of the Central American countrieshave given greater impetus to our integration process.This year  we took the decisions required to bring tofruition a customs union between El Salvador Honduras  Nicaragua and Guatemala.My Government is proposing a new beginning inits bilateral relationship with Belize. We must reach apermanent  just  equitable and honourable settlement ofthe territorial dispute between the two countries  whileat the same time making a constructive effort to resolvethe socio-economic problems afflicting our peoples.That is why my Government is promoting jointprojects relating to production  a trade agreement greater flexibility in the transit of persons  goods andservices  full observance of human rights and the12conclusion of agreements for mutual legal assistance all of which will contribute to the progress of ourpeoples and to the security of the region.The Central American countries have justconcluded trade negotiations with the United States.Last May  at the Guadalajara Summit  anannouncement was made regarding the initiation of aprocess leading up to an association agreementbetween Central America and the European Union  toinclude a free trade agreement. We will shortly besigning a trade agreement with Colombia  and we hopeto conclude free trade agreements with Taiwan MERCOSUR  the Andean Group and the CaribbeanCommunity.Looking after the interests of Guatemalanemigrants is also a priority issue for my Government.We provide support for them as they seek solutions totheir problems and respect for their fundamental rights.We are in contact with the receiving countries particularly the United States of America  with a viewto regularizing the situation of emigrants  who make asubstantial contribution to the well-being of theircommunities.All the efforts that Guatemala is making toovercome poverty and achieve socio-economicdevelopment necessarily depend on the progress beingmade in multilateral trade negotiations. Guatemalaappeals to the international community to fulfil itslongstanding commitments to eliminate all themeasures and practices that distort markets  toliberalize trade in our products and  more generally  toadopt measures enabling a country like Guatemala which has been striving to open its economy  to obtainbetter opportunities for access to markets for itsexports.May I take this opportunity to pay tribute to theUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala(MINUGUA)  which  after 10 years of fruitful work  isreaching the end of its mandate. MINUGUA has left animportant legacy in our country.I would like to turn now to our agenda at thissession. We are convinced of the need to adapt theOrganization to the new challenges  threats andchanges that humanity faces. We trust that 2005 willoffer us an opportunity to react to them in a responsiblemanner.One of the most timely issues is the reform of theSecurity Council. Our position thereon has beenevolving  reflecting the imperative need to make thatorgan more representative  transparent and effective.We advocate the expansion of its membership andcould agree to such an expansion being applied to bothcategories of members — permanent and non-permanent — so long as the need to ensure adequategeographic representation is taken into account. Thereform of the Security Council would be the point ofdeparture for the adaptation of all the organs of theUnited Nations to the new circumstances. We favourthe strengthening of the General Assembly and theEconomic and Social Council.We reiterate our complete repudiation of allforms of terrorism. We are taking all feasible measuresat the national level against the scourge and support thecollective action of the international community tocombat it  inter alia  through the implementation ofSecurity Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1390(2002)  as well as participation in the relevant treaties.We are convinced of the need for a strongercollective capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts. Webelieve that the United Nations should continue toaddress the imperative of development  including suchemerging issues as transnational migrations. We alsofeel that our Organization should play a vital role inseeking to ensure that the benefits of globalization arewidely distributed among all countries. In thatconnection  we wish to highlight the significance weattach to the Monterrey Consensus and theJohannesburg Plan of Action.Guatemala is conscious of the divisions thatpersist in the Middle East  Asia and Africa amongneighbouring countries. We earnestly hope that thedisputes between them can be resolved throughdialogue and other peaceful means  thus enabling allpeoples of the world to be represented here withoutrejection or discrimination.I wish to note in particular our concern over thesituation of the 23 million inhabitants of the Republicof China on Taiwan  whose aspirations torepresentation in international bodies remainunfulfilled. We also wish to voice our earnest hope thatthe difficult situation prevailing in the Middle East which has deteriorated of late  will be resolved inconformity with Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973)  1397 (2002) and 1402 (2002).13Under your guidance  Sir  this Assembly willhave to address issues of the greatest significance forhumankind and the United Nations. Guatemalaundertakes to participate actively in this year’s debatesand in the special event to be held just before our nextregular session. We hasten to offer our cooperationwith a view to the success of your endeavours."
"72",2958,"GUY",59,2004,"The General Assembly this most democratic and representative of UnitedNations organs  has served for almost six decades nowas a forum in which all States  no matter their size orstatus  may address with equal voice issues of interestand concern to them as well as to the internationalcommunity. It has indeed become the parliament ofhumankind.To the President of the General Assembly  adistinguished son of Africa  now falls the task ofguiding the deliberations of this fifty-ninth session. Iwould like to offer him my delegation’s warmcongratulations and good wishes as he assumes hishigh responsibilities.I would like to extend to the outgoing President The Honourable Julian Hunte  our appreciation andthanks for his magisterial direction of the Assembly’sactivities over the past year. His performance is asource of pride and satisfaction  not only to his nativeSaint Lucia  but also to the wider Caribbeancommunity  to which both our countries belong. Allowme also to convey to the Secretary-General  KofiAnnan  our gratitude for his sure and steady leadershipof the Organization during these tumultuous times.The speakers who have preceded me in the debatehave all expressed their preoccupation at the risinglevel of threat to global peace and security  as well asto our common economic and social security. Intenseconflict in places such as Afghanistan  Iraq andelsewhere in the Middle East  Africa and Europe hasdestroyed thousands of innocent lives and wreakedhavoc on the States involved. At the same time  despitethe many promises of globalization  developmentcontinues to elude the majority of countries  especiallythe poorest and most vulnerable. The HIV/AIDSpandemic has not abated  continuously robbing us ofprecious human and financial resources. Altogether the international scenario facing us is distressing offering scant hope for early improvement. Like others therefore  my delegation cannot help but state itsconcern at the ever-worsening international climate.While most of our problems are man-made  manyof our States  such as those in the Caribbean  must alsoface the constant threat of natural disasters. The recentwave of hurricanes that destroyed our sister State ofGrenada and severely battered other island countries such as Haiti  the Bahamas  Cuba  the Cayman Islands the Dominican Republic and Jamaica  has shown howdestructive the forces of nature can be to ourdevelopment. The Government of Guyana extends itssolidarity and support to all those afflicted  as well asto the United States of America  whose state of Floridahas also been seriously struck. Such is the frequency ofthese phenomena that the international communitymust now seek to devise stronger and more responsivemachinery to address their consequences. In thisregard  Guyana attaches high importance to theoutcome  next January  of the International Meeting toReview the Implementation of the Programme ofAction for the Sustainable Development of SmallIsland Developing States  which will be held inMauritius  and the World Conference on DisasterReduction  in Kobe  Japan.The scourge of terrorism has now reached such ascale that it has been aptly described as a third worldwar. Scarce resources must now be diverted fromdevelopment to the war on terror. Yet the rampage ofdestruction continues unrestrained. The process underway to stem the illicit global trade in small arms andlight weapons and to forge more effective internationalinstruments against terrorism and transnational crimecommands Guyana’s full support. We anxiously awaitthe report of the United Nations High-level Panel on7Threats  Challenges and Change  in the hope that it willoffer practical recommendations for preserving globalpeace and stability. The time may have come  webelieve  to fully implement the collective securitysystem that is envisaged in the United Nations Charter.The age of globalization and liberalization inwhich we now live has undoubtedly brought with itlaissez-faire attitudes and policies that have seriouslyaffected societies everywhere. Lawlessness andviolence are the new order of the day  threatening todestroy established systems of governance  especiallyin weak States  as demonstrated by the recentinterruption of the democratic process in Haiti  thenewest member of our Caribbean Community(CARICOM)  which has exacerbated social conditionsin that country. The Inter-American DemocraticCharter and  indeed  our own Charter of Civil Societyfor the Caribbean Community expressly condemn suchbreaches of democracy. Notwithstanding our concern atthese developments  Guyana stands ready to help thefraternal people of Haiti overcome their social distress.CARICOM  of which both Guyana and Haiti aremembers  is currently coordinating our humanitarianassistance to the island.Respect for the fundamental tenets of the UnitedNations is essential if we are to avoid conflicts. TheCharter is clear in its proscription of the use of forceexcept under the particular circumstances of ChapterVII. In this context  let me say that Guyana supportsthe reform of the Security Council through anexpansion in the membership of both the permanentand non-permanent categories and a generalimprovement of its modus operandi. After carefuldeliberation and in an attempt to break the currentlogjam in the discussions  my Government has decidedat this stage to support the aspirations of Brazil  Indiaand an African State to permanent membership. Webelieve that their participation as developing States inthe work of the Council will make that body morebalanced  representative and  ultimately  moreaccountable to the Assembly for the maintenance ofglobal peace and security.For Guyana  as for the rest of the internationalcommunity  the situation in Iraq continues to be asource of preoccupation. We would wish to see peaceand stability quickly restored to that country and itspeople. Similarly  we urge an end to the suicidalconflict between Israel and Palestine and a return tonegotiations leading to the creation of an independentPalestine and peaceful co-existence between the twoStates.As conflicts and humanitarian crises such as theone in Darfur continue to multiply  the United Nationsis being called to do more with less. We therefore callfor the strengthening of regional arrangements  such asthose of the Organization of American States and theAfrican Union  acting in concert with the UnitedNations  to assist in the search for durable solutions toconflicts and disputes.It is also imperative that we strive with greaterdetermination to secure our economic development andsocial progress. For more than six decades now  theinternational community has diligently sought answersto the development dilemma  moving from one facet toanother  from disarmament to basic needs  fromeconomic growth to full employment  from partnershipto national ownership and from good governance to thefree market. Thus far  however  the various models ofdevelopment followed have failed to achieve theirgoals. In the continuing exploration  this year’s HumanDevelopment Report has added culture to the list ofcrucial elements. As a small  multi-ethnic State Guyana fully accepts this proposition and is committedto preserving the culture that has brought our nationtogether in service to our national development.At the same time  we believe that culturaldiversity is a contemporary reality and must berecognized by all States. Too often  strategies for peaceand development ignore this reality with disastrousresults. Not enough consultation and coordination areundertaken to ensure that programmes and projects arein keeping with nationally defined priorities and localcircumstances. It is necessary  if failure is to beavoided  for there to be greater dialogue andcooperation in the planning process for development.National leadership remains a sine qua non forsuccessful development and must be stronglysupported by our development partners. In this spirit Guyana renews its support for the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and other suchinitiatives based on strong national leadership and fullinternational cooperation.President Lula of Brazil and the WorldCommission on the Social Dimension of Globalizationare to be commended for calling this Assembly’sattention to two major challenges facing theinternational community today  namely  poverty and8the inequities of globalization. Although we daily seeon our television screens the emaciated faces of thehungry  we are yet to be stirred with the compassionand generosity of heart needed to relieve their misery.As globalization gains further ground  many more willfall victim to further marginalization  especially insmall developing countries that are unable to takeadvantage of globalization. My own country hasrecently seen a devastating blow to its sugar industry on which thousands of our people depend  as a result oftrade liberalization and the reform of the EuropeanUnion’s sugar regime. Unless small States like ours areprovided with special and differential treatment  theywill be excluded from the global economy.Next year  the world’s leaders will meet to reviewthe progress made in achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). All the indications arethat there is hardly enough time to achieve ourobjectives. We can therefore ill afford to stand still. Wemust determine now what ought to be done to buildand sustain momentum to meet the 2015 targets.Guyana’s experience has been that these are not likelyto be achieved without sustained economic growth.Although we have sound poverty reduction andnational development strategies in place  we know thatsuccess depends in fair measure on a fair andsupportive international environment. We thereforeurge that high priority be accorded to greater debtrelief  the mobilization of development finance and thecreation of equitable trading conditions to enabledeveloping countries such as ours to achieve economicand social progress.It must be realized  however  that the MDGs although important and laudable  will not inthemselves bring about comprehensive and sustainabledevelopment. They are but a subset of the developmentagenda  which must include  if it is to be successful political  economic  social and environmentalconsiderations. Without a holistic and well-coordinatedapproach  lasting solutions to our problems will not befound. It is for that reason that my Governmentcontinues to advocate the establishment of a newglobal human order based on genuine interdependenceand partnership between developed and developingcountries. We are at a point in time when terror  war poverty and social chaos threaten to engulf allhumanity. We therefore hope that when the relevantitem comes before the Assembly next month  it willreceive the further support of the internationalcommunity.Within recent years the United Nations has facedmounting criticism for its lack of responsiveness toglobal challenges and for its failure to be democratic insome of its decision-making. While there is often arush to act on particular issues that are deemedimportant by some countries  much less attention ispaid to the concerns of the vast majority. As aconsequence  the credibility and even the legitimacy ofthe United Nations have been called into question. Ifthat trend continues  the hard-earned prestige of theOrganization will be debased and its effectivenesscurtailed. There can be no worse danger to humanitythan the rejection of multilateralism. We believeexperience has now clearly shown that unilateralismcannot resolve the problems of our contemporaryworld. Only through joint endeavours can we hope toachieve the freedom from fear and the freedom fromwant to which all our peoples aspire.As has been so aptly said  the United Nationsmay not take us to heaven but it can certainly save usfrom hell. Let us therefore renew our commitment tothe high purposes and principles for which it stands."
"73",3004,"HND",59,2004,"Forthe second time  I have this special opportunity ofappearing before you in the common home of thenations of the world. Everyone knows that we live in atime of great risks and problems  but also of greatopportunities. Allow me to refer to two challenges which in my opinion are the most important: the lackof security and the existence of poverty.First of all  I must refer to the lack of security. Ibelieve that it is obvious to everyone that the durabilityof our democratic system and the alleviation of povertyrequire us to provide for the security of each one of ourcitizens. My Government is committed to that. Thesafety of my compatriots is my first priority. I amcommitted to ensuring respect for human rights and within that concept  I am even more committed toensuring the protection and the security of honest andhard-working citizens. If we all strive to providesecurity and reduce our citizensí level of poverty  wewill also be combating terrorists  and we will bewinning the battle against those who take advantage ofthe positive qualities of democracy to destroy itthrough terror.Combating terrorism begins by combating crimeand delinquency in our countries. We are committed tothis struggle  and we know that we are not alone. Thisis  in fact  a universal challenge. We know that we canonly confront it if we are together. Crime  delinquencyand terrorism have  in effect  already undergoneglobalization and our actions  therefore  must beequally based on international cooperation.Organized crime appears in many shapes andforms. However  few are as degrading as drugtrafficking. Few crimes generate as much corruption orso thoroughly destroy the core of our society and ourvalues than drug trafficking. My country is on the drugtrafficking route. We are right in the middle of thecorridor that links the producers to the consumers. Weare victims of the greed of the producers and theperverted desires of the consumers. Over the past 18months in Honduras  we have impounded more drugsthan in all the previous nine years  but this is obviouslystill not enough. Combating organized crime and drugtrafficking  if we are alone  will be almost impossible.The Governments of the countries in which drugs areproduced  the countries that are used to transport thedrugs and the countries in which the drugs areconsumed must  together  confront this. If we arealone  the poor countries have very few chances ofsucceeding. If we remain alone  we will have to divertresources that we need to combat poverty towardscombating drug trafficking and organized crime. We7need more resolute  direct and substantial support if weare to confront this tremendous challenge. I would liketo say to the wealthy countries: let us work together toconfront this scourge of our time.Security also implies the rule of law and  for overthree years  we have worked to bring it about. We havecombated corruption by closing businesses thatengaged in tax evasion  eliminated the immunity ofpublic servants and promoted a responsible use of Stateresources. We have achieved a great deal  but werecognize that a great deal remains to be done. Werecently adopted a property law  which  for the firsttime in our history  enables the poor to hold deeds totheir land. This may seem simple and almost trivial indeveloped countries  but on our continent  by andlarge  the poor have not enjoyed the benefit of thesevaluable deeds. Eighty-four per cent of Hondurasícitizens do not have a title to the plot of land on whichthey live. We are opening new pathways  and beforemy Government completes its mandate  we hope thathundreds of thousands of poor people will hold  for thefirst time  registered titles to their property.Security also implies peaceful relationships withour neighbours. For the first time in our history  ourland borders have been defined  and they are nowbeing conclusively demarcated. What is even moreimportant is that this was achieved without spillingblood and without bellicose threats. We resorted to theInternational Court of Justice in The Hague and wehave complied with its rulings. As far as Honduras isconcerned  solving a border dispute is not somethingthat can be achieved through violence. It can be achievedpeacefully  through international jurisprudence.Having now consolidated our land borders  weare defining our maritime borders  and we have onceagain had recourse to the International Court of Justice.In our opinion  the time has now come to take thenext step. The time has come to declare Central Americaa zone of peace  a zone that renounces violence as ameans of resolving disputes. To consolidate thisprocess with the support of the Organization ofAmerican States  we have already eliminated all thelandmines that were placed around our country yearsago  and we can now say with pride that we are acountry that is entirely free of landmines. To bring thisprocess to completion  we now propose reducing thenumber of weapons of war throughout the region. Tolend credibility to this process  we invite the UnitedNations to accompany us and to certify compliance onthe part of each of our countries. We also invite theinternational community to join us in this process.We propose that the process of arms reduction besupported with fresh resources to combat poverty. Wepropose an exchange: weapons of war in exchange forfunding for poverty alleviation. Please support us.Poverty  and even more  hunger and malnutrition  arethe most fearsome enemies of our democratic systems.A democracy based on empty stomachs is an emptydemocracy. All the research that has been carried out including studies by the United Nations  tell us that today as never before  formal democracy prevailsthroughout our continent  in Latin America. However the same studies tell us that  today more than ever dissatisfaction with our democratic systems is rampant.Poverty undermines our democracies and hungererodes them. We know that combating poverty andhunger is an effort that must be shared by all. In ourcase  in Honduras  with much participation on the partof our citizens  we have devised a strategy to combatpoverty that incorporates the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. This legacy has been refined and perfected overthe past two years. The strategy to combat poverty isthe very foundation of our vision as a country and ofour planning as a nation.However  alone and in isolation  our effortsundoubtedly will not be able to produce the hoped-forresults for our people. We require the support of theinternational community. International cooperation isnot a handout; it is an investment. Everyone  absolutelyeveryone  derives benefit from it. Our small economiesare open to international trade and to globalization. Wedo not fear this challenge; in fact  we see that itprovides tremendous opportunities to us.However  we will not be able to overcome ourpoverty if the rules of international trade are not fair.We firmly believe that protected markets lead only tostagnation and the growth of poverty. It is not fair thatwhile we are opening our markets  other countries aregiving subsidies to their producers.We welcome the decision of the United States toreturn to the International Coffee Organization  but atthe same time we ask that the hundreds of thousands offamilies that grow coffee in rural areas be paid better.Let me give you an example. Five years ago  ourfarmers earned 40 per cent of the price of coffee servedto the final consumer. Today  they earn only 9 per cent 8while the companies in developed countries pocket thedifference. I invite the presidents and heads of State ofcoffee-producing countries to work together until weachieve a better price for all of our farmers. Together producers and consumers  we can make sure that coffeeis not a bitter drink for the producers.If the price of coffee can have a rapid andmassive impact on the struggle against poverty  theprice of oil  when it rises  rapidly makes our povertymuch worse. In the case of my country  over the pastyear the increased bill for oil is 12 times what wespend on providing school lunches to 870 000 boys andgirls who used to go to school without eating everyday. This is 12 times what it took us years and manysacrifices to achieve. The world has seldom seen somassive a transfer of resources from poor importingcountries to wealthy oil-exporting countries.I would like to take this opportunity to appeal tointernational conscience  and in particular to theconscience of oil-exporting countries  that we mayestablish a trading system that brings about a reductionin the price of oil and helps to stabilize it. We need asystem that takes account of poverty in countries andof the efforts that are being made to combat it. We needa system that enjoys United Nations supervision toensure that it is used properly.I am making a formal request to the UnitedNations to take the lead in this matter. I am notexaggerating when I say that there are few otheractions we could take that would make such a greatcontribution to reducing poverty. I would also like toappeal to the developed countries to use oil like ascarce resource. Let them continue to improve fuelefficiency and to establish taxes that reflect the truecost of oil. Let them coordinate measures to make surethat demand does not grow unduly and make pricesgrow too fast. They should make prudent use of a non-renewable resource to which we should all have access.I would like to conclude by appealing to all tostrengthen the United Nations system. That is the onlyway we can achieve peace in the world. Let ussubordinate our individual agendas in order to findagreed solutions here in the United Nations. The well-being of the world demands that we act in this manner.I would also add that we support reforming theSecurity Council by increasing the number ofpermanent and non-permanent members. This willmake it possible for countries such as Japan toparticipate  as well as a representative for LatinAmerica. This will lend greater legitimacy to theCouncilís decisions. We also support an all-embracingapproach for the United Nations  which  in our opinion means that we should find a way of enabling theChinese people in Taiwan to participate in the UnitedNations processes.As I said at the beginning  we are living in difficulttimes  but this is also a time of great opportunity. Wehold out our hand in friendship to everyone. All thatwe ask in exchange is to be treated fairly."
"74",3028,"HRV",59,2004,"This is my first addressto this body in my capacity as the Prime Minister ofCroatia. I feel privileged to be able to present theAssembly with the Croatian Government’s strategicpriorities in the domain of foreign policy.I would like at the outset to congratulate MinisterJean Ping on his assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly and to wish him every success inperforming his highly important task. He can rely fullyon Croatia’s support and cooperation.For the first time  Croatia is addressing theGeneral Assembly as a candidate country formembership in the European Union. Today  I wouldlike to share with you Croatia’s position with respect tothe most important tasks facing the United Nations atthis time of great multilateral challenges.The very fact that so many heads of State andGovernment leaders have gathered here in New York tomark the beginning of the fifty-ninth GeneralAssembly session serves as a telling affirmation thatmultilateralism is a driving force in global politics andconfirms that we live in no ordinary times.The world at the beginning of the twenty-firstcentury is profoundly different from the one in whichthe Berlin wall started to crumble. Never before havewe faced so many opportunities stemming from newtechnologies and enhanced regional and globalcooperation. And seldom have we encountered as manythreats and challenges as we do today.Tragic events in recent years  from New York toMoscow  from the Middle East all the way to SouthernAsia have confirmed that terrorism currently stands outas the most pressing threat to our world  taking  as ithas  thousands of innocent lives at random. Equallydangerous is the threat of weapons of mass destruction(WMDs). We must resort to all means necessary toprevent the proliferation of these vehicles of death. Ifthe two evils of terrorism and WMDs are synergized they could bring upon mankind an unforeseeable levelof destruction.Therefore  we must not relax our efforts in thefight against global terrorism nor neglect the deadlyimpact of WMDs. These issues must remain at the topof our priorities; any hesitation to address them in atimely and appropriate manner could have unforgivingconsequences.The United Nations should continue to play adecisive role in our quest for a stable  secure andprosperous world. Croatia welcomes the reports of theSecretary-General on the work of the United Nations(A/59/1) and the implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration (A/59/282). I would particularly like tocommend his reform efforts to date. He has identifiedmany challenges to the United Nations and we shouldnot hesitate to meet them. We particularly share hisassessment that the United Nations requires adequatesecurity and institutional agility to adapt to changingcircumstances in the world. The Security Council has aparamount responsibility in that regard  but we mustnot overlook the role of the General Assembly  whosepotential is far from being explored to the fullest.Regarding Security Council reform  Croatiasupports the enlargement of the Council in allcategories of membership  based on appropriateregional representation.Let us make the United Nations even morerelevant  with a range of inventive and collaborativeapproaches that will increase the effectiveness of ourjoint efforts and result in the Organization’s increasedcapability to respond to the needs and realities of thenew century.The credibility of the United Nations does notdepend solely on the political will of its Member Statesand its capacity to manage crises. It also depends on its39capacity to respond to the expectations of those whoare in dire need of assistance  who cannot protectthemselves from imbalances and injustice. We cannotshy away from seeking all available solutions to thefundamental global challenges we face today  includingextreme poverty  drug smuggling  the spread of deadlydiseases and global climate change. Globalizationneeds to be mastered; the opportunities it offers need tobe assessed and its excesses rectified.Finding appropriate answers to those fundamentalquestions requires multilateral cooperation  with aviable and effective United Nations at its core. We allwish to see a strong and decisive United Nations that iscapable of effectively responding to current and futurechallenges  but this cannot happen by default. Itdepends solely on the contribution and dedication ofeach and every Member State.Croatia gained extensive experience in post-conflict management after the war that was imposedupon it in the 1990s  especially in the fields of refugeereturn  confidence building  prosecuting war crimes economic reconstruction and the reintegration of war-torn areas with the rest of the country. We stand readyto contribute our knowledge and share it with thosewho need it.In confronting alarming challenges  such assecurity  poverty  terrorism  pandemics andenvironmental issues  collective action is most likely toyield the best results  since not even the most powerfulamong us can bear the burden alone.At this very moment  Croatian peacekeepers areparticipating in seven United Nations peacekeepingmissions. We are determined to further intensify ourparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missionswith respect to the composition and number of troopsdeployed  as well as the theatres of operation.We will continue to support the training ofpeacekeepers from newest troop-contributingcountries — whether provided directly or under theauspices of the United Nations — by receiving foreignofficers as attendees of the relevant training courses inthe Republic of Croatia  as well as by sending Croatianinstructors to organize and conduct courses in thenewest troop-contributing countries.Croatia has presented its candidacy formembership in the Security Council for the 2008-2009term. Our membership would not only represent a greattribute to my country  but also a recognition of all theeffort that has been fruitfully invested in the peace andstability of South-East Europe.We are proud of our achievements sincebecoming a United Nations Member State in May1992. From being part of a European powder keg Croatia grew into one of the key generators andpromoters of stability in South-East Europe andbeyond. With a growing economy  a greatly expandedhighway network and a blossoming tourism industry Croatia is firmly oriented towards the future. And I canstate with confidence that the best is yet to come.Croatia has successfully embarked upon the roadof Euro-Atlantic integration  with a clear goal ofEuropean Union and NATO membership. The bedrockof Croatia’s foreign policy remains good bilateralrelations with all our neighbours and beyond  cross-border and regional cooperation and constructivemultilateralism.My country is speedily preparing for the openingof accession negotiations with the European Union inearly 2005. We are confident that Croatia will fullymeet all the criteria required in this demanding processon time. We have already demonstrated our reform anddecision-making abilities through the fulfilment of theCopenhagen criteria required for European Unioncandidate status. This has been far from easy  but in theend  Croatia’s success demonstrates that hard work andreform-oriented policies are the best possibleinvestment in a country’s future.Croatia is ready to serve as a model country inSouth-East Europe  encouraging and assisting ourneighbours to realize their Euro-Atlantic ambitions.The prospect of EU membership has proved to be thebest incentive for the countries of Central and south-east Europe to implement comprehensive political economic  institutional and democratic reforms.A unified Europe is no longer a dream; it is areality upon which the prosperity and security of theentire continent is based. The European Union iseconomic prosperity and cooperation; it is stability andsecurity; but  above all  it is its values that stand out sostrongly. We all share the same values  the sameprinciples and the same dedication.A famous Croatian poet  Dobrisa Cesaric  wrote apoem about a waterfall whose beauty and might are40created by thousands of small drops of water. Croatia’sdrop is a part of this wonder  called “one Europe”.Croatia is determined to contribute to the best ofits ability to the success of this Organization and to theprinciples on which it is based. Too often we fail tofathom the true meaning of a phrase that is much morethan the mere name of our Organization: the UnitedNations.The United Nations — there can be no betterglobal formula in the face of the mounting challengesand the potential  burdens  hopes and expectations ofthe new century."
"75",3073,"HTI",59,2004,"It is apleasure for me  on behalf of the people and theGovernment of Haiti and on my own behalf  to expressto you  Sir  my heartfelt congratulations on yourelection on 10 June to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth regular session. Theoutstanding qualities that have won you this distinctionundoubtedly constitute a guarantee that our work willprogress well. I am convinced that advances will bemade in the search for viable and lasting solutions tothe different problems confronting the internationalcommunity. I also wish to express our gratitude toMinister Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia  whose far-sightedness and sense of balance gave decisive weightto his initiatives to give new dynamics to the work ofthe General Assembly during the last session.I also want to pay tribute to the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan  and to reiterateto him  on behalf of the Haitian people  our deepest9appreciation for the constant interest that he has shownin Haiti. This is also an opportunity for me to expressto you  Mr. President  and to the United Nations familymy deepest thanks for the expressions of sympathytowards — and solidarity with — the Haitian people once again struck by terrible floods on 18 and19 September 2004.Since 1945  our Organization has given proof ofits capacity for survival and renewal. Nonetheless  therecent course of events in certain parts of the world isof constant concern. The imposing of terror as a formof political expression is completely unacceptable. Inthis regard  Haiti endorses the relevant resolutions ofthe Security Council. The spiral of violence  whichtragically affects civilian populations here andelsewhere  is an attack on human dignity and on theculture of peace that the United Nations embodies. TheUnited Nations must necessarily play its role in theforefront  in accordance with the United NationsCharter  in the settlement of disputes that threateninternational peace and security. The Republic of Haitiwishes to reaffirm its commitment to the ideals and tothe principles of universality of our Organization andto the objectives of peace and development to beattained through international cooperation.While the Republic of Haiti celebrates  this year the bicentenary of its independence  it has had torequest the solidarity of the United Nations to help inthe stabilization of the situation in the country following the events of 29 February 2004. The Haitianpeople express their appreciation to the SecurityCouncil  which  at my request  gave the internationalcommunity the mandate to help Haiti in the process ofpolitical transition by virtue of Security Councilresolutions 1529 (2004) and 1542 (2004).Seven months after the major political events thattook place in Haiti  I have come here to bear witness tothe hopes that democratic renewal is inspiring in theHaitian population. I am also here to say  on behalf ofthe Haitian people and their Government  that theRepublic of Haiti has never felt as close to theprinciples and the objectives of the United Nations which  at the height of our distress  showed its interestin a future of freedom  democracy and collective well-being in Haiti.On 29 February 2004  in accordance with theprinciples of the Haitian Constitution and in mycapacity as Chief Justice of our Supreme Court  I tookmy oath as interim President of the Republic. Fifteendays later  a Government of transition was established with the participation of the political and social forcesof the country. The transition over which I ampresiding is designed to be inclusive. The democraticprocess has begun. Political parties are forming  andothers are reorganizing themselves. A constant andfruitful dialogue has begun between the authorities ofthe State  the political class and civil societyorganizations in the country. In that same spirit  amutually satisfactory agreement was reached on18 September between the Government authorities andthe representatives of the demobilized military. Thisthus spared the nation a bloodbath and a pointlessfratricidal struggle.I pledged  before the Haitian nation  to put an endto the political transition that dated back some 20years. May this transition put an end to the transition.General elections will be organized in 2005. TheGovernment resolutely supports this process  and  on7 February 2006  I must and will hand power over to ademocratically elected President.I thank those States that made the deployment ofthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti(MINUSTAH) possible  particularly those that havemade or will make contingents available to themission. I invite MINUSTAH to work more closelywith the Haitian authorities for genuine disarmament inthe country. It is not admissible that armed groupscommit their misdeeds with impunity  without beingthe least disturbed by the presence of MINUSTAH.The Haitian national police is steadily strengthening.The transitional Government counts on internationalcooperation to make that strengthening not onlyquantitative  but qualitative  in terms of training andequipment.Without the active and sustained support of theinternational community  the objectives of thetransitional Government might not be achieved. Thatfailure would mean a return to anarchy and chaos inHaiti and would be a grave setback to the UnitedNations.However  Haiti has a fresh look. All freedoms areguaranteed  international commitments are respectedand justice again prevails. Unfortunately  theGovernment of Haiti and its intentions were recentlyquestioned  following a verdict in which no member ofthe executive branch had any role whatsoever  and that 10in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of theRepublic.The necessary reform of the Haitian judicialsystem is clearly an imperative. But it is fundamentallyunjust to blame the present Government of brazeninterference in judiciary proceedings or tosystematically bleed magistrates and the civil servantsin charge of establishing the law.The Government of Haiti is extremely sensitiveto the comments and remarks of its friends and partnerswith whom it is cooperating in all fields of political economic and social governance; but it refuses to beassociated with or connected to decisions that involveonly one organ of the State  which acted completelyindependently  even if those decisions might raisecertain questions.What must not be forgotten is that I am stillPresident of the Court of Appeals  provisionallyexercising the function of President of the Republic.Therefore  I cannot tolerate any arbitrary action  norcan I tolerate any interference of the political authorityin the judiciary system. Justice must be independent.Guaranteeing security  promoting freedom andhuman dignity  promoting economic growth and socialdevelopment  preparing the provisional electoralcouncil for the holding of honest  credible and cleanelections — those are the objectives that theGovernment of Haiti intends to achieve through itsprogramme of action  within the current climate ofexceptional difficulties.For that reason  I make a solemn appeal from thisrostrum to the international community  to friendlycountries  to the specialized agencies of the UnitedNations system  and to all of those for whom solidarityis not just word that special attention  beyond symbolicgestures  be given to the Republic of Haiti so that asubstantial and well-directed cooperative effort mayhelp mobilize the necessary resources  with a view toimmediate and long-term action  and may promote thereturn of sustained growth in Haiti following years ofstagnation.The people of Haiti are starting anew  and it isnatural that at this time they should turn to the UnitedNations. Based upon the values and objectives that weshare  Haiti seeks the understanding of its naturalpartners so that it can at last break the infernal cycle ofviolence and isolation in which it has lived for toolong."
"76",3119,"HUN",59,2004,"I would like to take thisopportunity to extend to you  Sir  our sincerecongratulations on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. You maysafely count on my delegation’s full support in thedischarge of your important responsibilities.Hungary is firmly committed to effectivemultilateralism as a key tool of its foreign policy. Well-functioning international organizations and institutionshaving broad political support in the internationalcommunity can and should  indeed  play a significantrole in addressing the challenges of our globalizedworld.We are looking forward with eager expectation tothe outcome of the work of the High-Level Panel onThreats  Challenges and Change  set up by the23Secretary-General  to be finalized later this year.Addressing the complex and difficult tasks that we arefacing today needs not only strong political will on thepart of all of us  but also an improved and adaptedmultilateral framework of cooperation.Only a system of international institutions whoseactivities and form of operation are renewed andadjusted to the realities of our contemporary world canbe effective as an instrument in addressing successfullythe threats and challenges.Hungary remains strongly committed to makingthe United Nations more effective. To this end  theUnited Nations  including the Security Council  mustadapt to the changing circumstances of the politicallandscape.New and emerging threats  includinginternational terrorism  the danger of the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction and their means ofdelivery  transnational organized crime and failingStates are all grave menaces. The role played byMember States in prevention and early warning shouldtherefore be stronger than ever. These challenges areglobal or regional in nature and  in our view  theresponse to them must be at the same level. Withoutsuch enhanced cooperation among the members of theinternational community  all efforts are doomed to befruitless.Heinous acts of terrorism such as those thatcaused immense human suffering in New York Washington  D.C.  Bali  Istanbul  Madrid and  recently the Russian Federation  should be considered brutalattacks against the values of democracies. By puttinginnocent lives at risk  they also seek to undermine theopenness and tolerance of our societies.Along with our partners in the European Union Hungary strongly condemns all forms of terrorism. Inthis regard  we fully support the important work of theSecurity Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee. Wehope that its reinvigorated activity  including plannedvisits by the Committee to Member States  willcontribute to the enhancement of our capabilities incombating terrorism. It is of the utmost importance toprovide assistance in strengthening the preparedness ofthose countries that are eager to tackle the menaceoriginating from their territory.Substantial work has been undertaken on freezingfunds and financial resources to prevent the financingof terrorism. The United Nations has to continue to bea key player in that fight. To achieve real and tangibleresults in that regard  we have to ensure fullimplementation of the relevant Security Councilresolutions and the accession of the largest possiblenumber of States to international conventions andprotocols to combat terrorism. Hungary has done itspart to that end.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionand their means of delivery continues to be a clear andpresent threat to international peace and security. Newdiscoveries of large-scale nuclear-weapon programmes networks of illicit trafficking in nuclear material andtechnology and the ill-conceived policies of denial anddeceit about the purpose and nature of suchprogrammes remain a most serious concern to theinternational community. There is a growingrecognition  shared by Hungary  that those programmesalso represent the most serious risks of proliferation.The danger of nuclear  biological and chemicalweapons falling into the hands of rogue States  terroristgroups or  for that matter  any other non-State actorsthat menace our world  gives rise to new  majorsecurity challenges. In that regard  we must acttogether in a decisive manner  both regionally andglobally.In that respect  Hungary strongly supports theimplementation of Security Council resolution 1540(2004)  which calls on all States to establish effectivenational export controls. We urge full implementationof that resolution and are prepared to assist others indoing so.In our fast-changing world security environment the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) is and should remain the cornerstoneof the universal non-proliferation regime. Along withour European Union partners  we are committed tosafeguarding the Treaty’s authority and integrity. Inthat context  we are looking forward to the SeventhReview Conference of the NPT next year.We should continue our efforts in the field ofconflict prevention and post-conflict crisismanagement. For millions of people in conflict areas those efforts mean hope for peace and a better  moresecure future.We are confident that the joint efforts of the Iraqipeople and the international community will lead to ademocratic and prosperous Iraq living in peace with24itself and its neighbours. Hungary strongly condemnsthe terrorist acts and the kidnappings aimed atundermining the political and reconstruction process inthat much-suffering country. The contribution of theUnited Nations is essential for success. OurOrganization has already proven to be effective inadvancing the political process when it seemed to havecome to a standstill.Hungary continues to contribute  along withcoalition forces  to the stabilization and theimprovement of security conditions in Iraq. We deem itimportant that relevant international organizations andinstitutions increase their joint efforts towards that end including through the training of Iraqi securitypersonnel.At this moment  our priorities in Iraq must be toassist preparations for the national elections and thedrafting of a new constitution. Security Councilresolution 1546 (2004) provides a key role for theUnited Nations in the political transition process. Itsample experience in establishing democraticinstitutions  the rule of law  the promotion of respectfor human rights and fundamental freedoms andelectoral assistance can and should be utilized.Hungary views the potentially successfulrealization of the presidential and the subsequentparliamentary elections in Afghanistan as importantsteps towards the normalization of the politicalsituation in that country. We welcome the fact thatdespite unsatisfactory security conditions  progress isbeing made on preparations for the presidentialelections to be held in October this year.Hungary is deeply concerned about the continuedviolence in the Middle East  where substantial progressis yet to be achieved. We remain convinced that fulland unconditional implementation of the road mapoffers the best chance for the parties directly involvedto live side by side in peace and security. We urge allinvolved  including the Quartet  to redouble theirefforts to that end.The situation in the Balkans continues to remainat the centre of our attention. Overall developments inthe region and the efforts of the internationalcommunity have resulted in a calm but fragile politicalenvironment. In that respect  Hungary is committed tomaintaining its presence in the international missions in the service of peace and stability  in that regionwhich is so close to us.In that connection  we are following with seriousconcern the deterioration of the human rights situationin our immediate neighbourhood — in Serbia andMontenegro. It is particularly alarming that the numberof incidents perpetrated against the non-Serbpopulation  including the Hungarian community  is onthe rise. Hungary once again calls upon the Serbianauthorities to take the necessary measures to stop andto prevent those violent acts  as well as to identify prosecute and punish the perpetrators of serious crimesof physical abuse  as well as psychological threats andintimidation. We are looking forward to the results ofthe international monitoring currently under way.International protection of human rights andfundamental freedoms is at the core of the foreignpolicy of Hungary. It is not only an expression ofsupport for the universal values we feel so close to ourhearts. It is also an essential prerequisite for preservinghuman dignity and enhancing liberty in ourcontemporary world. Freedom of the individual andfull respect for the rights of human beings are matterswell above the authority of any given State.In today’s world  we could hardly find a countrywhere everyone speaks the same language or shares thesame culture  beliefs and traditions. The presence ofdifferent national  ethnic  linguistic and religiousgroups within the borders of a country is not only anasset but also a source of social and culturalenrichment. It is our firm belief that the UnitedNations  as the most comprehensive multilateralorganization  has a major role to play in the promotionof respect for  and the observance of  human rights including the rights of national minorities.Against that background  the internationalcommunity should continue to examine all possibleways to promote and establish an early-warningmechanism or a monitoring body dealing withminority-related situations. That should include theoptions of nominating a Special Rapporteur onminorities and elaborating a legally binding universaldocument to address shortcomings.Next year  with a major event  will be particularlyimportant for the United Nations. In the course ofaddressing the burning issues on our agenda  we haveto take a long  hard look at our tasks  including thereview of the implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration  adopted by heads of State andGovernment in 2000. In our view  the review exercise25requires careful preparation  vision  politicaldetermination and the courage to act. Hungary is readyand willing to take part in this process."
"77",3166,"IDN",59,2004,"I am pleased tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election as President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. May Ialso pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Julian RobertHunte of Saint Lucia  for having ably presided over ourdeliberations during the previous session of theGeneral Assembly.Even as I speak  a magnificent transformation isbeing completed on the other side of the globe — inmy country. Many of us in Indonesia have waited allour lives to witness this historic event: our peoplefinally rising to take their destiny into their own hands.Exactly a week ago  some 125 million men andwomen trooped to the polling stations and chose thePresident and Vice-President who will govern in thename of 230 million Indonesians. That was the thirdnational political exercise that we had to carry out —not just once  but three times — in a period of sixmonths  the previous two being the parliamentaryelections and the first round of the presidentialelections. All of them were peaceful  fair anddemocratic.Each of them was an enormous operation covering some 6 000 islands in an archipelago with anexpanse as wide as Europe’s  and involving millions ofelection workers attending to some 575 000 pollingstations. As we coped with the massive logisticalrequirements of that undertaking  we were extendedsupport and assistance by the United Nations andfriendly countries. We are grateful for this.It will be some time before the official results ofthe vote are in. But whoever the new national leadersof Indonesia may be  they will have a clear and strongmandate from the people — not from the elite  notfrom the party bosses  nor from power brokers orvested interests — but from the people. This is theclimax of a transition from authoritarian rule to a full-fledged democracy  a process that began six years agoin the crucible of the Asian crisis  which devastated oureconomy and mangled our socio-political system. Wehave thus become the full-fledged democracy that thefounding fathers of our Republic long ago envisioned.This need for political reform is also felt by othernations. The Emir of Qatar  speaking as Chairman ofthe Group of 77  told this Assembly at its 3rd meeting “Political reform and people’s participation indecision-making are no longer an option but havebecome a definite necessity”.Hence  we are proud of this democracy of ours. It is thefulfilment of a universal human aspiration  and yet it isunique to us. It sprang from our native soil  a true childof our culture. It was not imposed from outside  atgunpoint. And it put to rest the debate on whetherIslam and democracy can ever mix.As the country with the largest Muslimpopulation  Indonesia has proven that Islam can be abastion of democracy and social justice. Indeed  ourdeep sense of spirituality inspired our people toresoundingly reject money politics  corruption terrorism and all forms of extremism. It was also ourbeacon towards reform; and reform has worked for us.Although the Asian crisis instantly doubled the numberof Indonesians living below the poverty line  we havesince been able to reduce the poverty rate to its pre-crisis level. We did this by shifting from aGovernment-driven poverty-reduction strategy to oneof community empowerment. This effort requiredfunding of more than US$1 billion  making it one ofthe largest such programmes in the world.Through fiscal controls that dramatically loweredinflation  we stabilized the prices of essential goods.Through social safety net programmes  we helped thepoor to weather the crisis. By doing this  we denied theterrorists what could have been a dangerous mass base.Since then  consumer confidence has led oureconomic growth. With political fears allayed andinvestor confidence boosted  we look forward to 4.8per cent growth this year  and 5.5 per cent next year.We can now wage a stronger battle against poverty.By consolidating our efforts to promote the ruleof law  greater respect for human rights and effectiveregional autonomy as the main pillars of our reform we are confident that we can overcome threats to ournational unity and security  including communalviolence  separatism and terrorism.We continue to strengthen our relations with allour neighbours. We have made a fresh start withTimor-Leste  and we are building a strong relationship.13We look forward to a future of bilateral peace friendship and cooperation.This does not mean that we have solved all ourproblems. We still have to make democracy work forus some more and to keep it working. This is what 230million Indonesians devoutly wish  and they deserve noless. Moreover  no democracy is safe without beingassured of a democratic environment at the globallevel. That environment cannot be created by unilateralaction  no matter how mighty and well-intended.At the global level  democracy can be promotedonly by democratic means  through multilateralinstitutions like the United Nations. If  as its detractorssay  the United Nations is not an effective tool ofcollective security and development  this is onlybecause it has been denied the support that it deservesfrom its strongest and most influential Members.But we need the United Nations to givelegitimacy to the necessary use of force in the cause ofcollective security. And even the wealthiest nations inthe world cannot bear all the costs of global security.The privilege and burden of decision-making must beshared by all.Hence  we must empower the United Nations toserve as the effective tool of multilateralism that it wasalways meant to be. We must reform the UnitedNations comprehensively  including the SecurityCouncil  by making it more democratic  in terms ofprocedure and representation  in order to reflect today’sgeographical realities.In this regard  it may be recalled that Australialast year proposed the inclusion of Indonesia as apermanent member on the Council. We appreciateAustralia’s position. It has greatly encouraged us. Asthe world’s third largest pluralistic democracy  thefourth most populous country  the world’s largestMuslim nation  a country of tremendous culturaldiversity and a member with a track record of servingin various peace initiatives of the United Nations Indonesia has an important global constituency on theCouncil.Indonesia has served in more than 30peacekeeping missions  starting with the very first  inthe Middle East in 1957. Today  Indonesian soldiersand military observers are deployed in peacekeepingmissions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Sierra Leone  Liberia and Georgia. As a foundingmember and active player of the Non-AlignedMovement  the Group of 77  the Group of 15  theDeveloping Eight and the Organization of the IslamicConference  our commitment to the promotion ofinternational peace and understanding is self-evident.Indonesia has made key contributions to thepeaceful resolution of conflicts in its region  notably inCambodia and southern Philippines. It continues toactively build peace and stability in the region.A developing world striving not only for socialand economic progress but also for democratizationmust have a voice on the Security Council. ModerateIslam must have a voice on the Council. Indonesiawould be that voice. And that voice will insist — as wenow insist — that the fight against terrorism  like therelated fight against poverty  can be won. This is not todeny that terrorists are still capable of wreaking havocon our societies. Just two weeks ago  they struck againin the heart of Jakarta  killing nine innocent civiliansand wounding 150 others. We in Indonesia condemnthis act of inhuman savagery  mourn the loss ofinnocent life and share the pain and anger of thewounded and the bereaved families. But we are by nomeans intimidated. We will bring the perpetrators tojustice as we have always done after every terroristattack.Our faith remains firm that the fight against terrorcan be won. The world can be made immensely safer.But the global coalition to defeat terrorism must beinclusive. It must be multilateral and democratic. Itmust empower the moderates of the world. And it mustaddress the root causes of terrorism: the grievances andthe poignant sense of injustice that drive human beingsto such depths of despair that they would carry out themost heinous acts of mass murder and destruction. Itmust address grievances due to a poverty that is theoffshoot of social and economic inequity  the affrontsof tyranny and corruption  and the failure of States todeliver a standard of living that befits human dignity.Included are grievances due to political oppression such as the aggression and brutalities that thePalestinian people continue to suffer in the hands of theoccupying Power.For the coalition that would fight terrorism andpoverty to be truly multilateral and democratic  it mustinclude the regional organizations  which areenvisioned in the United Nations Charter as the pillarsof global multilateralism.14The United Nations itself  in extending assistanceand services to countries all over the world  needssupport at the regional level. This is why we in theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) arestriving to develop a robust partnership with the worldOrganization. We are confident that this partnershipwill prosper  as ASEAN evolves into a true communityby the year 2020. As a security community  we willassume full responsibility for our security and politicalstability. As an economic and sociocultural community we will be a stronger force for development and socialintegration in the Asia-Pacific region.Together with our counterparts in two continents we are building a bridge of cooperation across theIndian Ocean to form a partnership for development. Asummit of Asian and African nations will formallyestablish this strategic partnership in April 2005 inJakarta.At the same time  the summit will pay tribute to awatershed event in the cause of equitable internationalrelations. Thus  we will observe the Golden Jubilee ofthe Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in1955. Moreover  ASEAN is networking in alldirections  with its counterparts in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region  in Latin America and in Europe. Weexpect this network of regional organizations  inpartnership with the United Nations  to be the ultimateform of multilateralism. This network can also helpadvance a global democratic agenda. To this end  Asiacan make a significant contribution.Today Asia is certainly in the midst of ademocratic flowering. A series of successfuldemocratic elections in various Asian countries inrecent months has been hailed worldwide as a politicalmiracle that may be of deeper significance than theshort-lived Asian economic miracle a decade ago.But democracy is never a miracle — never a gift nor something imposed. It is always hard-earned andoften the fruit of many sacrifices. And its ultimateworth depends entirely upon us  the people — onwhether we have the political maturity  the wisdom andthe courage to make it work and make it endure. We inIndonesia are devoutly committed to that end."
"78",3213,"IND",59,2004,"Allow me to congratulate you Sir  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. May I assure you ofIndia’s full support in ensuring its success.As we gather here in the sixtieth year since theUnited Nations was founded  we might perhaps pauseto reflect on the fate of the ideas and ideals of theinternational community that inspired its creation. Thepost-war generation had already become aware that theworld which had emerged from the ashes of a globalwar could no longer be a peaceful world unless theunderlying forces of conflict were addressedeffectively by the entire community of nations as acollectivity. Nations were therefore united to make theworld a safer and more peaceful place — a world inwhich free peoples could pursue together a destiny ofshared prosperity.The impulse behind the creation of globalinstitutions nearly 60 years ago has become an evenmore pressing reality today. If we look around us  thesingle most defining characteristic of our contemporaryworld is the global  transnational character of thechallenges we confront  whether these are in the realmof international security or in that of development.Virtually every major issue that we face as nation-States has both a domestic and a transnationaldimension. It is becoming increasingly apparent asnever before that  unless we fashion a global responseto those challenges based on a meaningful consensus we will not succeed in creating a world that trulymanifests the ideals of the United Nations.Terrorism is one such challenge for which manyof us have paid an unacceptable price. We shall notforget that  three years ago  it was this great city thatwitnessed the single most horrendous terrorist act inhuman history. Approximately three weeks ago  inRussia  the world saw another brutal act of terrorwhich took the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians including a large number of young children.Terrorism exploits the technologies spawned byglobalization  recruits its foot soldiers on ideologies ofbigotry and hatred  and directly targets democracies.And yet  it is a sad reality that international networksof terror appear to cooperate more effectively amongthemselves than the democratic nations that they target.We speak about cooperation  but we often seemhesitant to commit ourselves to a truly global offensiveto root out terrorism with the pooling of resources  theexchanging of information  the sharing of intelligenceand the unambiguous unity of purpose that is required.That must change. We do have a global coalitionagainst terrorism; we must now give it substance andcredibility  avoiding selective approaches and politicalexpediency.I now turn to other challenges that we face today such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.There is an increasing reliance on restrictive regimesand on the use of punitive action to confront this threatto international peace and security. Although India isfirmly opposed to proliferation and has an impeccablerecord in that respect  we believe that it is only a globalconsensus of willing nations that will ultimately proveto be truly effective in that regard.The Chemical Weapons Convention is a goodmodel to follow with respect to other weapons of massdestruction  including nuclear weapons. It is throughrepresentative institutions  rather than throughexclusive clubs of privileged countries  that we canaddress global threats posed by the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and their means ofdelivery. As far back as 1988  Prime Minister RajivGandhi outlined a series of specific steps in an actionplan  whose central proposition remains valid eventoday — that progressive steps towards the elimination14of weapons of mass destruction must be based on abalance of obligations between those who possess suchweapons and those who do not.It is quite evident today that a global discourse isrequired for evolving a more cooperative andconsensual international security order. India believesthat such consensus must differentiate between Stateswhose actions strengthen non-proliferation and thosethat weaken the realization of its objectives.Let me now turn to the central theme for the vastmajority of United Nations Members; the challenge ofdevelopment and the eradication of mass poverty.Globalization has undoubtedly brought enhancedeffectiveness and efficiency in the functioning of oureconomies. It has integrated marketplaces  higherstandards of living and a revolution in globalconnectivity.But there is also the phenomenon of wideningeconomic disparities  both within and among countries.Connectivity also means that the people are painfullyaware — in real time — of how far and how fast theyare falling behind in their relative living conditions.Development today is no longer a function of domesticresources and national policies alone. It is a processthat is vitally linked to the international economicenvironment that the developing countries face.The international community must find ways tocontract those circles of exclusion. We need to findinnovative sources of financing and access to newtechnologies that are necessary to assist those who areon the margins of globalization. Just as prosperitycannot be sustained by being walled in  poverty cannotbe banished to some invisible periphery. Developmentmust therefore return to the centre of the globaldiscourse. We must evolve equitable and rule-basedregimes to manage global trade  investment flows andthe movement of services.Four years ago  at our Millennium Summit  weadopted ambitious global development goals  but it is amatter of concern that we have already fallen behind intheir implementation.While globalization has generated newchallenges  it has also given us new technologies todeal with those massive challenges. The world facesominous pandemics such as HIV/AIDS  but it todayalso possesses remedies and skills that can rid theworld of that scourge. We face problems ofenvironmental degradation in many parts of our planet but we also have available safe and environment-friendly technologies.Many countries are beset by problems of hungerand malnutrition  but we possess modern techniques offood production and processing to make a hunger-freeworld a credible and realistic dream. Although ourexcessive dependence on hydrocarbons raises concernsabout the long-term availability of energy and aboutthe security of supplies  technology has made availablemany environmentally sound alternative technologies.What we lack  however  is a truly global agreement anda mobilization of the international community toovercome the massive challenges.The experience of the decades since the inceptionof the United Nations demonstrates the greatsignificance of democracy as an instrument forachieving both peace and prosperity. While it isgratifying that the frontiers of democracy haveexpanded dramatically in the last decade and a half they still exclude significant numbers.Only a few months ago  in India’s fourteenthgeneral election  our country went through the largestexercise of popular will in the world. I can thereforeassert with confidence  the importance that nationalarticulations in global forums have in truly reflectingthe democratically expressed will of their people. Wechoose to overlook the absence of democracy in toomany cases for reasons of political expediency.Democracy’s representative nature validates thecommitments we take on as countries; it should alsodetermine the manner in which the architecture ofinternational institutions evolves. What is required forthe international community to successfully deal withglobal challenges — whether they be securitychallenges  economic challenges or challenges in thesphere of the environment — is the existence ofinternational institutions and a culture of genuinemultilateralism.The United Nations and its specialized agenciesare the only instruments available for respondingeffectively to the challenges we face collectively. Butwhat is missing is our sustained commitment todemocratizing the functioning of the United Nations.It is common knowledge that the United Nationsis often unable to exert an effective influence on globaleconomic and political issues of critical importance.15That is due to what may be called its democracydeficit  which stands in the way of an effectivemultilateralism based on a democratically-evolvedglobal consensus.Therefore  reform and restructuring of the UnitedNations system can alone provide a crucial link in anexpanding chain of efforts to refashion internationalstructures  imbuing them with a greater degree ofparticipatory decision-making so as to make them morerepresentative of contemporary realities.Our Millennium Declaration recognized theurgency of the reform of the United Nations SecurityCouncil. An overwhelming majority of the world’spopulation cannot be excluded from an institution thattoday legislates on an increasing number of issues with an ever-widening impact. The expansion of theSecurity Council  in the categories of both permanentand non-permanent members  and the inclusion ofcountries like India as permanent Members would be afirst step in the process of making the United Nations atruly representative body.I would like to make brief references to twocountries with which India has had historically friendlyties and whose early return to political normalcy is thefocus of the world’s attention.The situation in Iraq causes us great concern. TheUnited Nations has a central role to play in erasing thediscord of the recent past and in ensuring that the Iraqipeople can soon exercise effective sovereignty preserving the country’s unity and territorial integrity.An end to the suffering of the Iraqi people andrecognition of their aspirations should be the guidingobjectives. Consistent with our longstanding ties offriendship with the Iraqi people  India will contributeto Iraq’s humanitarian and economic reconstruction.In the past three years  the internationalcommunity has assisted Afghanistan in pulling backfrom the brink of chaos and chronic instability. Wesincerely hope that the upcoming presidential electionsand the subsequent parliamentary elections will allowthe Afghan people to express their will  free frominterference and intimidation. India’s assistance toAfghanistan’s reconstruction and development willcontinue.Relations between India and Pakistan have been amatter of attention for the international community. Itis known that in January this year India and Pakistaninitiated a composite dialogue to resolve all issues including that of Jammu and Kashmir. I reaffirm ourdetermination to carry forward that dialogue to apurposeful and mutually acceptable conclusion.In closing  I would like to reaffirm India’scommitment to the principles that have brought ustogether in this Organization. Those principles retaintheir relevance and validity even while the globaleconomy and the international political order pose newand very different challenges. All of us have to growout of the comfort of the predictable  discardconstraining habits of thought  and move forward withconfidence to meet the demands of the present and thefuture. Each of us has to be prepared to take on newobligations and larger responsibilities relevant to theneeds of our time.I deem it a privilege to say unhesitatingly thatIndia is conscious of the responsibilities that lie ahead.I speak of an India on the move — on the cutting edgeof economic  technological and developmentaltransformations. This is an India endowed withoutstanding human resources  and we are putting inplace policies which will respond to emerging andcritical tasks. We have the capabilities and capacity totake these on  and to participate in the restructuring ofa just and dynamic world order. We are confident that in the inextricably interdependent world we live in  ourcommitment to the common good  which thisOrganization embodies  will be resolute and full.In this  we are inspired by the vision ofinternationalism bequeathed to us by India’s first PrimeMinister  the great Jawaharlal Nehru — a vision of aworld order whose pillars are peace  harmony cooperation and development. That vision needs toreanimate the collective wisdom of the worldcommunity for a new partnership to meet theunprecedented challenges we face."
"79",3259,"IRL",59,2004,"I first addressed theGeneral Assembly in the year 2000. The millenniumyear was a time of great hope  reflected in the outcomeof the Millennium Summit. World leaders committedthe peoples of the planet to a new beginning in whichthe dawn of the twenty-first century would mark abreak from the past  with a new sharing of burdens and a new common dedication to peace and humanprogress.Today the light of that new dawn is obscured bythe dark clouds of war  terror  ethnic violence andcontinuing abuse of human rights. Twelve months agoand again this week  the Secretary-General pointed outthat the Organization is at a fork in the road and thatwe have to decide on the way forward. Much work hasbeen undertaken since the Secretary-General laid downthat challenge. The High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change is working on its report. I ampleased to recall that the European Union (EU) made adetailed submission to the Panel  drawn up duringIreland's recent presidency of the Union. We also tooka decision to mainstream the issue of effectivemultilateralism in the Unionís discussions with otherregional groups.We await the Panel's report and the Secretary-Generalís recommendations that will follow. In hisaddress on Tuesday  the Secretary-General expressedthe hope that when the heads of State and Governmentmeet next year to review progress on the MillenniumDeclaration they will be ready to take bold decisions.They must  because the longer we linger at the fork inthe road  the more difficult will be the road ahead.We cannot afford to postpone action. More andmore citizens of the world are questioning whether theUnited Nations has the capacity  or even the will  toprevent conflict and protect the vulnerable frominjustice. They are becoming increasingly disillusionedwith an Organization which either cannot takedecisions or whose decisions are ignored withimpunity. They see the politics of the lowest commondenominator in operation  with strong and sensibledraft resolutions watered down to mere platitudes.They hear the United Nations being denigrated bythose who make a virtue of their determination to putnational interests above all other considerations. Theyfear that the Organization is no longer driven by thedetermination and idealism of the founding fathers.My Prime Minister  Taoiseach Bertie Ahern made clear last year  when he addressed the GeneralAssembly  where the fault lies. It lies with us  theGovernments of the Member States. We have a strongand much respected Secretary-General in Kofi Annan.We have brave and dedicated officials. Many have puttheir lives on the line for the Organization and what itstands for. Some have made the ultimate sacrifice. UnitedNations staff deserve better protection in the future.It is time for the Governments of Member Statesto act. We need  as the Secretary-General put it  to seekcommon solutions to common problems. That willrequire political will and effective structures. Neitherone on its own will suffice. The essential requirementis a more effective system of collective security. Such asystem requires the unique legitimacy offered by aneffective United Nations and its Charter.It is clear that the composition of the SecurityCouncil no longer accurately reflects globalgeopolitical realities. In Irelandís view  a modest andregionally balanced increase in its membership  both inthe permanent and non-permanent categories  isjustified. Increased representation from the developingworld would enhance its legitimacy  and thereby itseffectiveness.But a more effective Security Council will needmore than a change in structures. There has to be achange in attitudes. Those States that sit on the SecurityCouncil have a responsibility to rise above national orregional interests and act in the wider interests ofmankind. That is an obligation that rests on each andevery member of the Council. But those who eitherassert or aspire to positions of world leadership - andthere is no shortage of candidates - bear a particularresponsibility to act in the global interest.Putting national interests first is not an effectiveanswer to the challenges that confront us. It may be aclichÈ to say that our planet is shrinking  but that doesnot make it any less true. While most of us continue towish to organize and govern ourselves primarily withinthe framework of the nation-State  we must recognizethat technological development and economic37integration are impairing the effectiveness of thenation-State as a defensive bastion.Power and influence must be used in the interestsof the international community as a whole  rather thanfor the pursuit of narrow  short-term interests. Statesand regions have broad and varied interests  bothindividual and collective. Our system mustaccommodate and reconcile those interests. Otherwisewe are doomed to division between those who wouldimpose hegemony and those who would resist it.In his report on the implementation of theMillennium Declaration  the Secretary-General haswarned that the world is falling short in itsperformance towards the achievement of theMillennium Development Goals. In sub-Saharan Africaespecially  many countries are caught in a poverty trapand face the crippling challenges of unsustainable debtand HIV/AIDS  often compounded by instability.Ireland fully recognizes the seriousness of theshortfall in development funding that faces us  which ispresently estimated at Ä50 billion per year. The bestmeans of bridging that gap is for donor nations torecommit themselves to reaching the United Nationstarget for official development assistance of 0.7 percent of gross national product. The Irish Governmentremains committed to that goal. Ireland  which hasincreased its official development assistance verysubstantially in recent years  will continue workingactively with its developing country partners to build astrong global partnership for development.Economic and social development is the meansby which the worldís poorer countries can be lifted outof poverty. An open international trading regime aimedat facilitating investment is an integral part of ourmultilateral system  and fair market access is anessential part of that. Some developing countriesestimate that  in a best-case scenario  a successfuloutcome to the Doha Round could help raise up to 500million people out of extreme poverty. Fairerinternational trading arrangements are imperative if weare to address the problems of underdevelopment.Ireland and its European Union partners are determinednot to be found wanting in the task of bringing theDoha Round of multilateral trade negotiations  finally to a conclusion  with an agreement that meets theessential concerns of all sides.Over the past year we have once again seen thatthe failure of State institutions is a major source ofconflict and human misery. The responsibility forprotecting people from conflict and the effects ofconflict  and from humanitarian catastrophe  liesprimarily with the Governments concerned. However it has been well demonstrated that events within aparticular country can threaten international peace andsecurity and spread misery far beyond its borders.Where Governments are unable or unwilling to take thenecessary steps to prevent catastrophe in their owncountry  I believe that the international community hasresponsibilities to protect in those circumstances.It is increasingly evident that instability veryfrequently arises from situations where human rightsare abused or denied. The abuse of human rights is alsoat the root of poverty and underdevelopment. Respectfor human rights  on the other hand  is an essentialelement of good governance  and must be at the centreof efforts to prevent conflict  and of post-conflictreconstruction. Presently  40 per cent of conflicts thatappear to have been resolved break out again withinfive years. We simply must do better in identifyingemerging problems sooner. We also need to put inplace policies and structures that are effective within anew  enforceable legal framework.I hope  therefore  that the High-level Panel willaddress the serious questions involved in internationalintervention  and put forward recommendations thatwill act as a basis for consensus. We trust that they willalso give full and careful consideration to the policiesand structures that we need in order to carry out ourresponsibilities towards States and societies at risk ofinstability. Any such structures must facilitate asustained engagement with those States  to ensure thatthey receive whatever assistance is needed - political humanitarian and economic - to avert instability or areturn to conflict. In addressing those problems on thebasis of the report of the High-level Panel  let us notsacrifice substance on the altar of process.Ireland welcomes the increasing role of regionaland subregional organizations in crisis management under the overall authority of the Security Council. TheEuropean Union is engaged in developing its role inconflict prevention and crisis management  while fullyrecognizing the central role and authority of the UnitedNations. I am pleased to state that during Irelandísrecent presidency of the European Union  importantprogress was achieved in implementing the JointDeclaration on United Nations-European UnionCooperation in Crisis Management. It was agreed in38June  during our presidency  that the European Unionwill make a rapid response capability available  and atthe service of the United Nations. That will take effecton an initial basis in 2005  with the full complement of1 500 troops being ready and available by 2007.The efforts of the African Union and theEconomic Community of West African States in crisismanagement have been particularly valuable anddeserve support. The African Unionís involvement inDarfur  where it currently has 120 monitors with aprotection force of 300  is an extremely positivedevelopment. It is fully supported by the EuropeanUnion  including through the African Peace Facility established during Irelandís recent presidency of theUnion. The African Union is planning to augment itscontingent in Sudan  where it is estimated that a forceof at least 5 000 may be necessary to assure a secureenvironment for the people of Darfur. The EuropeanUnion is ready to increase its backing for the AfricanUnionís effort accordingly.Whatever political difficulties may have arisen inDarfur  the people there did not deserve to suffermassacre  rape and famine  or to see their villages andcrops destroyed and their livestock driven off. Whenthe depredations of the ruthless militias were unleashedupon them  they looked in vain for the even-handedprotection of their Government.I want to recognize the efforts of United Nationsagencies and non-governmental organizations óincluding Irish organizations such as GOAL  Concernand TrÛcaire ó that responded so quickly andgenerously to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. Thededication of humanitarian aid workers must also beapplauded.The humanitarian needs in Darfur still remainimmense. I appeal for continued support from theinternational community to meet the funding shortfall.Ireland has contributed almost $6 million inGovernment-funded aid so far this year to assist thehumanitarian effort there through United Nationsagencies as well as through Irish and international non-governmental organizations. The Irish people havebeen greatly moved by the suffering in Darfur and havebeen generous in providing additional  non-governmentfinancial support for the relief effort.I also wish to pay tribute to the leadership of theSecretary-General in insisting on an appropriateresponse from the Security Council. I welcome therecent adoption by the Security Council of resolution1564 (2004)  although it is a matter of regret andbewilderment to many that the resolution did notreceive the unanimous backing of Council members. Ihope that the Council will now unite in seeking toassert its will and bring an end to a situation that is anaffront to humanity.I urge the authorities in the Sudan to fulfil  withthe utmost urgency  the obligations that have beenimposed on them by the Security Council. They mustcooperate closely with the monitors deployed by theAfrican Union. They must ensure that the Janjaweedmilitia are brought under control and disarmed and thatpersons responsible for crimes and serious violations ofhuman rights are brought to justice. And they mustensure that secure conditions are restored so thatpeople can return voluntarily to their homes. I alsourge all parties in the Abuja talks  including the rebelgroups  to show flexibility and goodwill so that theunderlying problems of Darfur can be resolved in apeaceful manner.Once again  we meet in the General AssemblyHall under the shadow of terrorism. The recentappalling images from Beslan provide a furtheremphatic demonstration of the moral bankruptcy ofterrorism. The fact that those attacks targeted innocentchildren  along with the consequent trauma caused tochildren worldwide who saw the torn bodies of thechildren and mothers of Beslan on their televisionscreens  make them all the more heinous. Theyreinforce  if reinforcement were needed  the absoluteduty of Member States of the United Nations tocooperate effectively in identifying and bringing tojustice those who plan  direct  finance  facilitate andcarry out terrorist acts.Terrorist acts are always reprehensible  and thosewho carry them out bear full responsibility for them.That is true irrespective of any underlying factors thatmight exist  such as national or civil conflict oroppressive economic or social conditions. We mustshow determination to confront and face downterrorists when they test our resolve through theirinvolvement in heinous acts of violence designed toterrorize the public into conceding to their distortedview of the world. But we also have to be smart to win.Terrorism can rarely be defeated by exclusivelymilitary or security means  although those means areobviously a very necessary component in the fight39against terrorism. It is necessary  at the same time  toaddress the root causes of terrorism. I made that pointwhen I addressed the General Assembly in theaftermath of the atrocities of 11 September  and I makeno apologies for repeating it today. Let there be nomisunderstanding. I offer no excuses for terrorism.Terrorism is evil. But it is my strong belief that peopleare not born evil. At a certain point in their lives something - perhaps a particular event or theexperience of indoctrination - causes them to embraceevil. To seek to address that root cause is not to be softon terrorism  it is the intelligent way to attackterrorism.Terrorism tests the effectiveness of our nationaland collective security systems  but it also tests thequality of our institutions  including our systems ofjustice  and the strength of our values. As we seek toprotect ourselves  we must ensure that thoseinstitutions remain strong  that democratic values arenot undermined  that our systems of justice are notcompromised and that our struggle is conducted in fullrespect for international law and human rights norms.If we fail to do that  any success we achieve overterrorists will be at the expense of the way of life weseek to protect.The people of Israel and Palestine continue tosuffer from violence that is as futile as it is tragic. Theroot cause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a struggleover land. The land must be shared by agreementarrived at through negotiation between the parties tothe conflict. The continuing unilateral expansion ofsettlements and the construction and maintenance ofthe separation barrier on the West Bank will make theconflict more difficult to resolve. The entire internationalcommunity - particularly Israelís friends ó need tosend that clear and unambiguous message to the IsraeliGovernment and the people of Israel.Ireland acknowledges the right  indeed theresponsibility  of the Israeli Government to protect itspeople  including  if it so wishes  by a security fencealong its recognized borders. However  the building ofthe fence in the West Bank serves to divide Palestiniancommunities and creates severe hardship for them. Itwill also serve to perpetuate the so-called facts on theground  and make it more difficult to reach a finalsettlement. The advisory opinion of the InternationalCourt of Justice has given clear guidance on the fencethat should be given careful consideration by thosewhose policies and actions it addresses.The Palestinian Authority must also assume itsresponsibilities under the road map  notwithstandingthe difficulties it faces. Effective and responsibleleadership is required. The Palestinian people can bestachieve their sovereignty by restoring nationaldiscipline and rejecting the path of violence.Ireland  in common with its EU partners continues to believe that the only way to reach acomprehensive settlement of the conflict is through theQuartet road map. In the Tullamore Declaration  issuedduring Irelandís recent presidency of the EuropeanUnion  EU ministers welcomed the expressed intentionof Prime Minister Sharon to withdraw from Gaza andacknowledged the impetus that such a withdrawalcould give to the peace process  as long as it metcertain conditions  including that it take place in thecontext of the implementation of the road map.I therefore urge Israel and the PalestinianAuthority to cooperate closely with the Quartet toensure that the withdrawal from Gaza is accompaniedby the full and effective assumption by the PalestinianAuthority of its responsibilities in the territory  and thata momentum towards the full implementation of theroad map is developed.The passage of Security Council resolution 1546(2004) and the subsequent establishment of the InterimGovernment of Iraq  represented a crucial comingtogether by the international community on theimportance of reconstruction in Iraq. It is vital that thatGovernment should be able to move ahead andestablish a full democratic mandate. However  thesecurity situation in Iraq remains a matter of graveconcern to us all  and the challenges facing the newGovernment are great. An end to the lethal violencethat is disrupting the normal development of thatcountry is essential.Ireland has always seen the role of the UnitedNations as central to the issue of reconstructing Iraq.We therefore welcome the forthcoming return of theUnited Nations mission. Ireland and its EU partnerswill seek to ensure that that mission is provided withthe necessary security to allow it to carry out itsfunctions.The Irish and British Governments continue towork in close partnership to consolidate peace andpolitical stability in Northern Ireland. Since the GoodFriday Agreement of 1998  considerable progress hasbeen made in improving and normalizing life in40Northern Ireland. In our view  the completeimplementation of the Good Friday Agreement remainsdefinitively the best way forward.The elections to the Northern Ireland Assemblylast November gave leadership mandates to the SinnFein party and the Democratic Unionist Party in theirrespective nationalist and unionist communities. Sincethen  both Governments have engaged in intensivediscussions with all the parties to finally resolve thekey issues of confidence that have thus far frustratedthe full achievement of peace and political stability inNorthern Ireland. Those key issues include endingparamilitary activity in all its forms; completing theprocess of decommissioning Irish Republican Armyweapons; the implementation by the BritishGovernment of the agreed programme of normalizationand demilitarization; ensuring that the new policingservice is supported by all sections of the communityand resolving the related issue of the devolution ofjustice and policing powers; and obtainingcommitments from all parties to fully participate in theinstitutions of the Agreement.Those were the issues that were addressed inthree days of intensive talks that were convened byboth Governments in Leeds Castle in England lastweek. Substantial progress was made in the talksregarding the issues of paramilitarism and armsdecommissioning. As Prime Minister Blair said afterthe talks  the contours of the paramilitary question arenow in sight of being resolved  to be accompanied bysubsequent demilitarization  as agreed in the jointdeclaration issued by the British and IrishGovernments last October. In addition  significantprogress was made with regard to the policing issueand the devolution of those powers to devolvedinstitutions in Northern Ireland.Regrettably  it was not possible to achieveagreement among the parties themselves on thequestion of the operation of the political institutions ofthe Agreement. Talks are continuing in Belfast thisweek to see if the gaps between the parties on thatissue can be resolved. The gaps are narrow and can and must  be overcome at the earliest possible date. Itwas noteworthy in that regard that the leader of theDemocratic Unionist Party  Mr. Ian Paisley  made thepoint immediately after the talks that a goldenopportunity has been available to realize a stable andentirely peaceful future. For our part  the IrishGovernment is open to considering changes that wouldimprove the workings of the institutions whilemaintaining compliance with the fundamentals of theAgreement  and we have brought forward proposals inthat regard. But  I reiterate  as the Taoiseach emphasizedlast weekend  such changes must not disturb thefundamental balance of the Good Friday Agreement  inparticular its key power-sharing provisions.The resolution of those institutional questionswould allow both Governments to bring forward acomprehensive package providing a template forpolitical stability in Northern Ireland. It would be atragedy if the failure to bridge the remaining gaps onthat institutional matter frustrated the goal ofdefinitively removing the issue of arms from politics inNorthern Ireland. The people  rightly  would notunderstand why that long-awaited prize was deniedbecause of a reluctance to fully embrace the structuresof partnership and power-sharing.If  on the other hand  those institutional issuescan be resolved and a comprehensive agreement thenbrought forward  we can finally liberate partnershippolitics in Northern Ireland and allow its committedand talented politicians ó from all sides of thecommunity ó to collectively get on with the job ofproviding better governance  a prospering economyand a fair society for all of the people.I will conclude where I began  on the need torededicate ourselves to the reinvigoration of this greatOrganization.Next year will be a year in which importantdecisions on the future of the United Nations must betaken. We need to rededicate ourselves to the principlesand purposes for which this Organization was founded.We need to restore the sense of ambition and idealismthat illuminated the United Nations at its inception. Weneed  above all  to build an Organization that is results-oriented and that can demonstrate that politics is themost effective means of resolving conflict. Let us make2005 the year in which the United Nations is rebornstrong  effective and respected  as the founding fathersintended it to be."
"80",3306,"IRN",59,2004,"Anoverall and realistic review of the current developmentsin international relations reveals that our world todayfaces the formidable challenge of extremism.Extremism has two distinct and yetinterconnected faces: the violence and terrorism ofnon-State actors and the unbridled militarism of States.The former leads to increasing insecurity and the latterto increasing lawlessness. Insecurity is manifested inhorrendous acts of extreme violence and terrorism whether it is in Iraq  Afghanistan or Russia.Lawlessness is manifested in acting outside ofinternational law and the United Nations Charter andrelying on the glorification of force and the blatant useof military might. Lawless militarism of the powerfulhas given rise to increasing violence and terrorism andis also marketed as their panacea. We must berelentless against the former in a truly collective andall-inclusive manner  and we will muster the courageand national discipline to guard against the latter andremain within the confines of international law.The increasing insecurity and escalation of actsof violence and terrorism in different parts of the worldare a matter of serious concern to all of us. The recenttragic incidents in Iraq  in the school in Beslan in theRussian Federation’s North Ossetia  and State terrorismin occupied Palestine have shocked and outraged allpeoples worldwide. No rationale can justify the killingof children and the innocent.As terrorism has become an internationalchallenge  an effective fight against it requires a globalapproach based on collective cooperation under theprovisions of the United Nations Charter as well as theprinciples of international law. We must rise abovebusiness-as-usual politics and avoid discrimination double standards and selectivity in our approach tofighting this global menace. As a victim of terrorism the Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemnsterrorism in all its forms and manifestations  and wehave demonstrated our strong commitment to fightingterrorism by the arrest and handover of the greatestnumber of Al Qaeda members apprehended by anysingle State to date. Our commitment fighting terrorismis unwavering. However  the prevailing internationalapproach  which is primarily a law and order approach is clearly failing to curb terrorism. We need to revisit ourpremises and try to develop a genuinely collective inclusive  well-rounded and multidisciplinary approach if we are serious about this fight. No State can evencome close to doing it alone.The increasing lawless militarism  the secondface of the challenge we encounter  is the use of bruteand unsanctioned military force to achieve somepolitical goals  albeit desirable goals. A clear exampleof this lawlessness is the attack against Iraq. The attack33against Iraq was illegal. I wish to thank ourdistinguished Secretary-General for making thisstatement a few days ego and courageously defendingthe Charter of the United Nations and the rule of law. Ifwe  in this body  do not collectively defend the rule oflaw  we have helped to send the United Nations Charterto oblivion  thereby serving domination and militarism.We in Iran benefited greatly by the removal ofSaddam Hussein. Many in Iran are joyous to see themurderer of their sons behind bars. However  as amatter of principle  and as a principle of the UnitedNations Charter  this cannot be regarded as anythingbut the fruit of the forbidden tree. The internationalcommunity has demonstrated that it will not celebrateachieving this desirable goal through the illegal meansof glorifying military power and rushing to use forcewithout the approval of the United Nations.The increasing lawlessness of States constituteseven a greater danger to our security. It undermines ourcollective ability to contain terrorism and violence. Itoffsets our efforts to promote justice  equality freedom  dignity and prosperity for all  because  ifcontinued  it will lower everyone’s quality of life anddevalue our humanity. The prevailing world realitiesillustrate that unbridled militarism and blind terrorismare mutually reinforcing. The international communitymust work together to find a way to liberate itself fromthis vicious cycle.In this context  one particular area that requiresresolute action by the international community is theexistence and proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. As the only victim of the unbridled use ofthese weapons in recent years  Iran feels very stronglyabout the absolute imperative of a collective and rule-based multilateral campaign to eradicate all suchweapons and to prevent the proliferation of nuclearweapons as an interim measure. This must be done bythe universal application of disarmament and non-proliferation instruments in a comprehensive and non-discriminatory manner. The relevant multilateralinstruments must become truly universal and the rightsand obligations of all must be scrupulously enforced.Access to technology for peaceful purposes is the onlytrue incentive for the universality of those instruments.At the same time  the legitimate disarmament and non-proliferation concerns of the international communitymust be addressed through transparency and thevigorous application of monitoring mechanisms. Iranhas always been prepared to contribute actively to thatglobal effort. While we insist on our right totechnology for peaceful purposes  we have left — andwill leave — no stone unturned in order to provideassurances of our peaceful intentions.Iran has been in the forefront of efforts toestablish a zone free from weapons of mass destructionin the Middle East. This initiative  which has receivedthe repeated approval of this Assembly and the SecurityCouncil  has been systematically obstructed by Israel’sintransigence and its rejection — regrettably  withimpunity — of all multilateral instruments. All countriesof the region and beyond are unanimous in consideringthe Israeli arsenal  including its weapons of massdestruction  combined with its policy and record ofaggression and State terrorism  as the single greatestthreat to regional and global peace and security. Israelcannot hide these facts behind smoke screens. It is timefor the international community to show its resolve tomaintain the credibility of multilateral disarmamentinstruments by taking action to compel Israel tocomply.Next year will mark the sixtieth anniversary ofthe entry into force of the United Nations Charter. Thenext General Assembly will receive the report of theHigh-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change.Now in the final stages of preparing its report  thePanel would be well-advised to go beyond thegenerally advertised perceptions of threats andchallenges  and to address the more fundamentalmalady of our age — that is  violence and theglorification of military might. Obviously  theprescription that the Panel will provide will very muchdepend on its own perception of threats.In that context  the paradigm of Dialogue amongCivilizations  presented by President Khatami of theIslamic Republic of Iran and warmly received by theinternational community  continues to provide the onlyvehicle to help promote mutual understanding andfacilitate cooperation among States in the pursuit ofpeace  tolerance  freedom and prosperity.In 2005  coinciding with the sixtieth anniversaryof the adoption of the United Nations Charter  theimplementation of the Global Agenda for Dialogueamong Civilizations will be reviewed. Based on theinternational experience gained in the period from2001 through 2005  such a review can help theinternational community to further advance thatparadigm as a long-term process towards promoting34peace  democracy and development — the real principlesand objectives of the United Nations Charter.We condemn all acts of violence and terrorism inIraq. We stress the need for promoting security andpreserving the unity  territorial integrity and politicalindependence of Iraq  promoting democracy throughdrafting a new constitution  holding free and fairelections as scheduled and accelerating thereconstruction of Iraq  as well as the speedywithdrawal of foreign forces from that country.We welcomed the formation and supported theoperation of the Iraqi transitional government as apositive step towards the restoration of the Iraqipeople’s sovereignty. We emphasize that the UnitedNations has a pivotal role to play and substantialresponsibilities to discharge in the transitional period.We also welcome the position of the UnitedNations Secretary-General on the important role thatthe neighbouring countries to Iraq can play in therestoration of peace and stability in Iraq and in itsreconstruction.In the Palestinian lands  the world is witnessing with much regret and concern  the continued grossviolation of human rights and the Israeli policy ofoccupation and repression against the oppressedPalestinian people.A durable peace in Palestine will only be possibleif it is based on justice and guarantees an end to theoccupation of the Palestinian lands  restoration of theinalienable rights of the Palestinian people  return ofthe people of the Palestinian diaspora to theirhomeland  participation of all in a democratic processand the establishment of a Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.We are of the view that the enlightenedPalestinian people are capable of independentlydeciding their political and social affairs and werespect their free decisions on the future of Palestine.We welcome the valuable efforts by theGovernment of Afghanistan to consolidate peace security and stability in the country. In addition holding fair and free presidential and legislativeelections and establishing a broad-based representativeand multi-ethnic government  will be vital steps in theprocess of democratization and reconstruction inAfghanistan.Realization of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals is inseparable from viable international peaceand security. Otherwise the political  social  economicand cultural problems of our world will continue toincrease cumulatively  leaving us in a more desperatesituation. In our view  the only option available to us isto foster closer international cooperation underinternationally recognized rules and instruments in thelight of dialogue  justice and democracy."
"81",3353,"IRQ",59,2004,"It is withpleasure that I congratulate you  Sir  on yourassumption of the presidency at the fifty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly.It is also a pleasure to speak to the Assemblytoday as the Prime Minister of a fully sovereign Statethat seeks to recover its place among the community ofnations. Iraq has been isolated from the internationalcommunity for a very long time. It was deprived of thevery important role it should play in the community ofnations. The Iraqi people aspire to recover that roletoday.Iraq is a nation rich in cultural heritage andhistory  as the cradle of civilization. But the oppressiveregime of Saddam Hussein cast a long  sinister shadowover Iraq. It traumatized and suppressed the people ofIraq for decades. With the fall of Saddam Hussein’s11oppressive regime  our country and the world havebeen made safer. New horizons for fruitful andconstructive cooperation with the world have emerged.A new situation has emerged in Iraq  which isnow experiencing a conflict of far-reachingconsequences for the country’s future and its relationswith the world. It is the struggle of the Iraqi people —and its vision for future peace and democracy —against the terrorists and extremists and the remnantsof Saddam Hussein’s regime  who are targeting thatnoble dream long nurtured by our people. It is thestruggle of all civilized nations against those workingto destroy civilization and world culture. I thereforeappeal to the representatives of the countries assembledhere to help Iraq to defeat the forces of terrorism and tobuild a better future for its people.The President returned to the Chair.The brutal dictatorship imposed by SaddamHussein on Iraq brought destruction to Iraq andbrutalized and traumatized the Iraqi people. The regimekilled hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens. Itarrested and tortured many thousands more and drovemillions of Iraqis to leave their country after deprivingthem of the most fundamental human and civil rights.It also ruined relations among Iraqis by sowing theseeds of religious  ethnic and other divisions.My words today cannot adequately convey theoppression and suffering endured by the Iraqi peopleover three decades. We have discovered 262 massgraves  and we continue to find more; they prove thecorruption of the Saddam regime and its lack ofcompassion and respect for life.During the brutal era of Saddam Hussein  thedream of the Iraqi people was to build a democratic federal and free Iraq that would ensure a dignified lifefor its citizens. Today  we have a genuine opportunityto make that dream come true. Iraq has now become acountry of laws that ensure respect for human rightsand freedoms. It has a Government that embodies thediversity of the Iraqi people within the framework ofgenuine national unity.Today  we are also preparing to hold democraticelections next January under the timeline set in theLaw of Administration of the State of Iraq for theTransitional Period and in Security Council resolution1546 (2004). We are committed to that timeline despitethe complexities and difficulties involved  and  withthe Assembly’s help  we can meet the deadline.Holding elections is a vital and necessary step towardsimproving the security situation in Iraq. We hope thatall Iraqis will participate in the elections and contributeto the completion of the political process.Nonetheless  there is a tiny extremist minoritythat seeks to deprive Iraqis of the opportunity to fulfiltheir dream of building a democratic future in Iraq.Like all terrorists everywhere in the world  those whoare responsible for terrorism in Iraq hate democracy freedom and humanity. They are abetted in theircriminal endeavours by a number of foreigners whohave infiltrated Iraq from neighbouring countries.There are also criminals from the previous regime  whoaim at destroying our country and impeding progress.They are not freedom fighters  as is claimed by somebiased circles. They do not mean to liberate ourcountry; rather  they want to spread chaos  violenceand terror and jeopardize the security of citizens and ofthe country. They target the dreams and aspirations ofthe Iraqi people.In fact  our goal in the ongoing conflict is torestore stability and the rule of law and to enable themen  women and children of Iraq to live free from fear.The aim of the terrorists  on the other hand  is todestroy the aspirations and will power of our peoplethrough mass killings and the destruction of Iraq’sinfrastructure  and to stop economic life in Iraq andcreate a state of tension  panic and instability in orderto undermine peace and security. They want to destroyhuman civilization in our region and  indeed throughout the world.For all those reasons  my Government’s toppriorities are to defeat the terrorists’ schemes  toestablish security throughout Iraq and to hunt down theterrorists and bring them to justice. We have developedplans to promote security as a vital precondition for thereconstruction of Iraq  the restoration of economicprogress  the completion of the political process  theachievement of national reconciliation and thepromotion of a culture of tolerance among all citizensof Iraq.Perhaps members now appreciate the dauntingtask we are facing. We look forward to assistance fromour neighbours and all of our friends in theinternational community in order to achieve securityand stability in Iraq. I recognize that some countrieshere objected to the war that brought down the12oppressive regime of Saddam Hussein and liberated thepeople of Iraq. And that is their right. However differences over this issue should not remain anobstacle to establishing new cooperative relationshipsthat would allow Iraq to receive serious internationalsupport to consolidate security  freedom anddemocracy in our country and to forge ahead on thepath of development and progress.Iraq welcomes international support for theobjectives of the Iraqi people as outlined in SecurityCouncil resolution 1546 (2004)  which was adoptedunanimously. That resolution reaffirms the sovereigntyand territorial integrity of Iraq and endorses theformation of the national Government. It also affirmsthe international community’s commitment to supportthe Government in fulfilling the will of the Iraqi peopleby holding elections and establishing the proper legalframework for political parties and civil society. Inaddition  it places emphasis on the re-establishment ofan effective governmental structure  the application ofthe principle of social justice  and the promotion of aclimate of tolerance  dialogue and human rights.We need more assistance from our neighboursand from the international community as a whole tomeet all those objectives and to translate theaspirations of the Iraqi people into realities after somany decades of suffering under the oppression of theprevious regime and its excessive practices. We areproud of our membership of the League of Arab States the Organization of the Islamic Conference and theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  andwe have started a fruitful dialogue with the EuropeanUnion. We hope that all that will lead to concretepositive results in the near future.Also  I am pleased to announce here that theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has agreedto assist Iraq in the training of its security forces. Iespecially welcome the upcoming conference ofneighbouring countries and other friendly countries with the objective of empowering the Iraqi people toface its challenges and dangers and of establishingstability in Iraq.It is our duty to coordinate our efforts in the fightagainst terrorism and to exchange information. It isalso our duty to ensure that our national borders aremore secure  so that we can halt the infiltration ofterrorists into Iraq and put an end to their destructiveactivities. In that context  we call upon all friendly andpeace-loving nations to stand by Iraq; we need theirimmediate assistance. We need more assistance fromthe multinational force  and we need a broadening ofthe base of countries contributing troops to that force so that it will be better equipped and more determinedto confront terrorism and to provide security protectionfor the United Nations and its agencies when theyreturn to Iraq.My Government is committed to thereconstruction and development of the nationaleconomy and is working with the World Bank  theUnited Nations system and the International MonetaryFund to complete the reforms under way and enhanceIraq’s prospects for welfare and prosperity  so that itcan become effective as a trading partner of othernations. The problem of foreign debt has emerged asthe most serious obstacle on that road. Our debtsamount to billions of dollars  which is beyond ourcapacity to repay. This places an unjust burden on theIraqi people  since those debts arose from theprohibitive costs improperly incurred by the formerregime in its unjustified wars  its support forinternational terrorism  its acquisition of weapons ofmass destruction and its plunder of our nationalresources.With good intentions and rational management Iraq hopes to reach agreement with the Paris Club bythe end of this year in order to achieve substantialreductions in our debts. Here  I would like to expressour gratitude to those countries that have decided towrite off their loans to Iraq  and I appeal to othercreditor nations to show the same generosity. Withouttheir assistance  we will not be able to reconstruct Iraqand attract the foreign investment that would enhanceour ability to defeat terrorism and improve security forthe Iraqi people  ensuring increased economic benefitsfor the region and entire world. Also  I appeal to donorcountries that have pledged generous financialassistance to fulfil their obligations in order to help usreconstruct our country. We welcome the meeting ofdonor countries scheduled to be convened next monthin Tokyo. Such financial assistance will create anatmosphere of optimism that will allow us to leave thepast totally behind and will help us finance reforms anddevelopment projects on the ground. In addition  wehope that Iraq’s friends will provide financialassistance to ensure the success of our democraticelections.13We seek international assistance from the UnitedNations for the special Iraqi court in order to ensurethat all defendants  whatever serious crimes they maybe charged with  receive fair trials within the justicesystem. That would help Iraq free itself from thepernicious shackles of the past.We stress that the efforts and resourcescommitted by the international community to promoteIraq’s democracy and revive its economy shall not havebeen committed in vain. They may even have apositive impact on the entire region and the world as awhole  creating a climate conducive to peace  securityand international and regional cooperation on the basisof respect for mutual interests.We highly appreciate the role and good offices ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan in helping us lay thefoundations of freedom and democracy. We also paytribute to Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi  former Personal Envoyof the Secretary-General  for his work on theconstitution of the interim Iraqi Government. We alsowelcome the appointment of Mr. Ashraf Qazi asMr. Brahimi’s successor. We further welcome theassistance team dispatched by the United Nations tohelp us meet our obligation to convene generalelections in January.We look forward to welcoming United Nationspersonnel in Iraq to help see us through an effectivepolitical process and reconstruction. We warmly lookforward to the return of all United Nations agencies tofulfil their noble mission in Iraq.On this occasion  I wish to recall with deepanguish and sorrow the destruction of the UnitedNations headquarters in Baghdad just over a year agoin a brutal and barbaric terrorist attack that claimed thelives of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  a brilliantinternational figure  and of other United Nations staffmembers in the international compound. Their memorywill remain a vivid testimony for the promotion ofdemocracy and stability in Iraq. I stress ourdetermination to defeat the cowardly terrorists whotarget the lives of foreign workers who come to Iraq tohelp us fulfil our noble mission.Iraq follows closely the challenges that face thecountries of the world  including the emergence of newforms of terrorism  the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction  the need to reduce poverty  theachievement of the Millennium Development Goals respect for human rights and the consolidation ofdemocracy and equality. In that regard  Iraq appeals tothe United Nations in particular to strive even harder to combat and eradicate the horrendous scourge ofterrorism. That struggle calls for new ideas and firmerresolve to implement the existing agreements. It isimportant that we affirm the commitment of theGovernment and people of Iraq to succeed in thisbattle.Terrorism is a disease that is spreadingthroughout the world  employing misleading slogans.Terrorists have killed numerous people in the name ofIslam in New York  Turkey  the Kingdom of SaudiArabia  Bali  Madrid  Baghdad and elsewhere. Theyare criminals who commit their evil acts without mercyand evince only a taste for barbarism and bloodshed.Today  they have chosen Iraq as their battlegroundbecause they fear the success of the Iraqi experienceand the restoration of Iraq’s stability  development anddemocratic institution-building. They will reap nothingbut failure and total defeat.Thus  our struggle is the United Nations struggle our victory will be its victory and our defeat will be itsdefeat. Indeed  the values of democracy  freedom justice and equality for all  irrespective of gender colour  faith or race  are common human values. Thereis no room or excuse for those who seek to divide ourworld by making a distinction of Muslims  which isextremely damaging to the unity of human society peace and security.Furthermore  we believe in the importance ofconsolidating peace and stability in the Middle East onthe basis of United Nations resolutions  of respect formutual rights and of a just and comprehensive peace.Let me appeal today before the internationalcommunity  both to those who supported the war inIraq and to those who opposed it  as well as to theUnited Nations itself  not to remain neutral or idle inthe struggle  but to join us for our sake as well as fortheir own. The fulfilment of the Iraqi people’s dream ofa free  stable and prosperous Iraq  with good standingin the family of peace-loving nations  will strengthenour capacity and resolve to achieve justice and peace to defeat terrorism and violence  and to end all formsof division and hatred among nations. Let us stand sideby side as one international family in order to achieveour noble cause."
"82",3400,"ISL",59,2004,"Sir  it is with greatpleasure that I congratulate you on your election asPresident of the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly.We are living in trying and turbulent times. As wemeet  the world continues to be haunted by the spectreof terrorism  as most recently evidenced in Russia andIraq. The victims are  as always  the innocent. Theobjective is global instability and insecurity  leading toincreased intolerance and social regression. Thehideousness of the means employed by terroristsexposes them for what they are. No just political causecan be served by such acts.The war against terrorism is a struggle againstbarbarism. The perpetrators of terror must be rootedout and their bases and networks destroyed. This war isinherently a campaign in support of the values of the48United Nations — the values that we all seek tofoster — and it is in response to a threat that hasserious implications for all of the Member States of ourOrganization. Our challenge is actively to defendfreedom against the forces of tyranny to affect theconditions that help create the spectre of terrorism.If anyone thought the threats to global securitythat provided the impetus for looking at seriousreforms of the United Nations system had receded then surely the recent terrorist outrage in southernRussia gives pause for reflection. The great challengesin Afghanistan and Iraq  as well as in parts of Africa and the considerable work still remaining to achievethe Millennium Development Goals testify to the factthat the need for change has not passed. On thecontrary.The High-level Panel will soon submit its report and next year a summit is planned for the sixtiethanniversary of the United Nations and the fifth yearafter the Millennium Summit. Iceland believes that wenow have a historic opportunity to undertakemeaningful and long-awaited reform. This would in nosmall way be a reinforcement of the idea ofmultilateralism and  if genuine and far-sighted  willequip the United Nations to deal more effectively withthreats to global security.It will be our weighty responsibility here nextyear to hammer out decisions on reform. We will havethe opportunity to make changes that will equip themultilateral system to be more effective in preventingconflict  in resolving conflict where it occurs and inpost-conflict peace-building.We can of course choose to do nothing. We canlinger complacently in the inertia of the status quo. Theconsequence would  however  be that the UnitedNations would become less and less capable of facingthese common challenges to our security.In particular  we must grasp the chance to makethe Security Council itself more representative  whileincreasing its efficiency and effectiveness. Thediscussions of many years on increasing the number ofnon-permanent and permanent seats must reach aconclusion. It is time that certain countries that havelong made a considerable contribution to the work ofthe United Nations be given permanent seats on theSecurity Council. I am referring in particular toGermany  India  Japan and Brazil. But it is no lessimportant to ensure that Africa also be given apermanent seat on the Council.Smaller States make up the vast majority ofUnited Nations Members. Ensuring that smaller Statesare adequately represented in the various organs of theUnited Nations is not only a matter of paying dueregard to the principles of sovereignty; it is also apractical matter of ensuring that the particularchallenges faced by smaller States — both island Statesand others — are taken into account in the multilateralsystem. Iceland knows the problems related to beingfar away from potential markets. We know well thestruggle of small economies to diversify  and we havedirect experience of the vulnerability of small countriesto external economic shocks and natural disasters. Iwould like to take this opportunity to extend oursympathy to all those Caribbean States that havesuffered so much in the recent hurricanes. MyGovernment is considering ways in which it couldcontribute to disaster relief or reconstruction.Just as it is fundamental to the legitimacy of theSecurity Council that there be fair representation of thevarious regions of the world  it is also important thatthe many smaller States feel that their issues areunderstood and taken into account. In that context  Iwould like to refer to the previously announcedcandidacy of my country  Iceland  for a non-permanentseat on the Security Council for the period 2009-2010 which was already endorsed in 1998 by the NordicStates — Denmark  Finland  Norway and Sweden —within the Group of Western European and otherStates.Smaller States make a valuable contribution torunning the multilateral system. Smaller States providesome of the most innovative thinking on approaches tothe challenges we face and — in per capita terms andoften in absolute terms — are some of the mostgenerous contributors.An issue of key concern to small island States but also to the world at large  is sustainable use of theworld’s resources. As Iceland completed its term as amember of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment (CSD)  my Government was very pleasedto see the organizational changes in the workingmethods of the CSD implemented at its twelfth session in April. My Government looks forward to continuingits active participation in the future work of the CSD toachieve and promote the sustainable development of49the world’s resources. Iceland will also continue towork on alternative energy resources  particularly thepossibilities of hydrogen as a clean-energy provider.Iceland is committed to attaining the MillenniumDevelopment Goals as they are set out in theMillennium Declaration. My Government willparticipate actively in the preparations for the majorsummit in 2005. It is clear that the internationalcommunity must speed up its efforts in order toachieve  before 2015  the goals set by the MillenniumSummit. We regard the 2005 summit to be one of theimportant milestones on the way to attaining them.I now turn to questions concerning particularregions. Iceland warmly welcomes the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)initiative and its aim of ensuring democracy  humanrights  good governance and sound economicmanagement. The efforts of African countries in themanagement and resolution of conflicts in their ownregion and the establishment of a Peace and SecurityCouncil within the African Union are ground-breakingdevelopments  as are the African mediation in anumber of conflicts and the efforts of the AfricanUnion and African regional organizations to developtheir capabilities for peace-supporting operations.Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the focus ofIcelandic bilateral development cooperation  and wewill continue to increase our contribution to andinvolvement in multilateral development cooperation.Iceland welcomes the recent understandingamong members of the World Trade Organization on aframework for the continuation of the Dohadevelopment round of negotiations on tradeliberalization. The multilateral trading system is aproven vehicle for promoting economic developmentand growth  and it is central to the future prosperity ofour nations. It is noteworthy that particular attention ispaid to the needs of the least developed countries. It isimportant that they fully reap the benefits that themultilateral trading system has to offer. Icelandbelieves that the framework will give the negotiators inGeneva a new platform for the prompt conclusion ofthe Doha round. We want to do our part in making surethat globalization benefits all countries  not leastthrough targeted development cooperation. In an effortto assist African countries in making the most of theDoha round  Iceland is participating  together with theother Nordic countries  in the Nordic Africa initiative.Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) unanimously adopted on 6 June  provided for therestoration of sovereignty in Iraq. The resolutionassigns the United Nations a leading role in helping tobuild a legitimate representative Government anddemocratic institutions. It also demonstrated the will ofthe Council — and indeed of the rest of theinternational community — to resolve past differencesand to give first priority to the political and economicreconstruction of Iraq. My Government remainsprepared to lend its support to the difficult work aheadin Iraq. In Iraq  as elsewhere  Iceland would like toemphasize the importance of ensuring the safety ofUnited Nations missions.Afghanistan will continue to occupy our attentionin the coming months. The United Nations has donevaluable work in registering some 10 million voters.The presidential elections on 9 October in Afghanistanwill be an important milestone in the process ofrebuilding the country. We must maintain an ongoingcommitment to Afghanistan  where serious challengesto the rebuilding of the country continue to be faced.Iceland has demonstrated its support and has assumedthe leading role in running the Kabul internationalairport  under the auspices of the NATO-ledInternational Security Assistance Force.An area of continuing concern is  of course  theMiddle East. The Icelandic Government continues tocall on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to resumenegotiations on a political settlement. The road mapsets out a realistic way to achieve a two-State solution.Iceland fully supports the efforts of the Quartet. Weurge the Quartet and all other well-intentioned partiesto continue to focus on this issue.At the beginning of my remarks  I concentratedon terrorism. Terrorism is an assault on human rights. Iwould like to express strong support for the initiativeof the Secretary-General urging Member States toratify all those conventions that concern protection ofthe rights of the ordinary citizen.In conducting the war against terrorism  we mustprotect the human rights that terrorists themselvesflout. We must be sure that human rights andhumanitarian law are not sacrificed. Here  I would liketo refer to the key role played by the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross — and by the entire RedCross and Red Crescent movement — in monitoringthe implementation of the Geneva Conventions  and at50the same time to express my appreciation for thatwork.During this session of the General Assembly Iceland will continue to work to advance the issue ofhuman rights. In that context  we look forward tomarking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the entry intoforce of the Convention on the Elimination of AllForms of Discrimination against Women  and we urgethose States that are not parties to accede to theConvention. Iceland will also continue to work withothers to uproot racism and religious intolerance as amajor way to prevent conflict and create a securehuman environment.Iceland is totally committed to the multilateralsystem  of which the United Nations is the fulcrum.Without an effective multilateral system  conflict andits causes will be much more difficult to address. But in order to be effective  the system needs change. TheGovernment of Iceland sincerely hopes that we canbring about necessary change during the next year  andwe look forward to working with all Member States tothat end."
"83",3447,"ISR",59,2004,"I would like to congratulateyou  Sir  the Foreign Minister of Gabon  upon yourassumption of the presidency of the General Assemblyand to wish you much success.The United Nations was established out of thedevastation of the Second World War in order to builda world of unity and of peace. Today  60 years after theOrganization came into being  we must ask ourselves:What are we united for and what are we united against?Are we united for peace and security? Are we unitedfor fairness and justice? Are we united against terror?Are we united against tyranny?Or are we  sadly  united only in cynical andimmoral majority votes that make a mockery of thenoble ideals on which this body was founded?Tomorrow is Yom Kippur  the holiest day of the Jewishcalendar  when all Jews stand before God to accountfor their actions. It is an appropriate time for all19nations  separately and together  to engage in such anaccounting.I sense a change in the world. In the face of theglobal campaign of terror which has left no countryfree of its devastating impact  the world is beginning torealize what we in Israel have long known: thatterrorism is a challenge to humanity as a whole  notjust to individual countries; that the response to thatglobal threat must also be global if it is to be effective;that the threat of terrorism anywhere is a threat tofreedom everywhere; that fighting terror is crucial toour ability to bring peace.There was a time when the problems of terror Islamic fundamentalism and Iranian nuclear ambitionwere seen as local problems — Israel’s problems —not challenges which threatened the community ofnations as a whole. Today  however  our community ofnations is more united than ever in the battle againstterrorism  whose sole objective is to undermineeverything that we seek to build: peace  stability prosperity and opportunity for all.Today we are also more united than ever inopposition to the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. The international community now realizesthat Iran — with missiles that can reach London  Paris Berlin and southern Russia — poses a threat not onlyto the security of Israel  but to the security and stabilityof the whole world. Indeed  Iran has replaced SaddamHussein as the world’s number-one exporter of terror hate and instability.The international community now also realizes as reflected in Security Council resolution 1559(2004)  that Syria’s occupation of Lebanon and itssupport for Palestinian terror must end if our collectiveaspirations are to be fulfilled.And the international community now realizesthat terror and tyranny are the twin enemies of theindividual freedoms and human rights — including theright to life itself — which define our humanity.Today  the community of nations knows thatsecuring freedom and democracy for all the peoples of theworld must be our collective goal. The pictures of humanflesh torn apart by the terrorists  from New York toBeslan — and just yesterday  once again  in Jerusalem— are waking us up to the challenge we face.In that spirit of unity  and in the name of all thosein the world who suffer from terror and tyranny  I callon the Assembly to refocus its aspirations and itspriorities. I call on the Assembly to end its obsessionwith Israel and to ensure that United Nations resourcesare allocated more equally and more effectively. OurUnited Nations must provide solutions to the globalchallenges of hunger and poverty  of disease andweapons proliferation  of drug trafficking andsustainable development. We must not let thePalestinian desire to vilify Israel distract our globalcommunity from the obligation to address the needs ofall peoples.I call on the Assembly to address head-on theactive involvement of Iran and Syria in terrorism andSyria’s continued occupation of Lebanon. There can beno place in the community of nations for those whopromote the killing of children. I call on the Assemblyto promote practical measures to help nations cut offall financial and political lifelines of terror.I call on the Assembly to address the growth ofanti-Semitism and other forms of racism andintolerance. I urge you  Mr. President  and theSecretary-General  to convene a special session of theAssembly on that crucial matter. We all share theresponsibility to educate our children to understandingand tolerance rather than to hatred and incitement.We must build a united and global coalition tofight terrorism  racism and anti-Semitism. We mustbuild a united front against the cold-blooded murderersof our children. In that battle  there is no middleground. There is no room for explanations or excuses.There are no mitigating circumstances. Declarationsand condemnations are very important  but they are notenough. Every nation  every Government  every leaderhas the responsibility to act. Those who choose insteadto support and sponsor terror must be isolated and heldto account for their crimes.When I speak of terror and its dangers to life andfreedom  I speak from bitter personal experience. Myown home town of Beersheva suffered a double suicidebombing just three weeks ago. Sixteen innocent peoplewere killed when their commuter buses were blown up.In the middle of an important meeting with visitingofficials  I rushed to call my mother and brother tocheck that they were alive. Hamas  which operatesfreely from Palestinian territory and receives supportand safe haven from the regimes in Damascus andTehran  proudly claimed responsibility for that horrificattack.20Again yesterday  as I was meeting with theSecretary-General to discuss peace in the Middle East I was passed a note informing me of a suicide atrocity in which two more Israelis were blown to pieces by aPalestinian terrorist. And this morning  once again  yetmore Palestinian murderers took the lives of threeyoung Israelis in an attack on Morag.In the last year alone  150 Israelis have beenkilled and thousands more injured in more than 40separate suicide bombings and other cold-bloodedattacks. More than 200 additional suicide-bombingattempts were blocked by our defensive measures.No Israeli mother is free of the fear that her childmay be lost. No Israeli child is immune to theterrorists’ plans. In the name of God above and allhumanity here on Earth  this killing must stop.Palestinian terrorism is the key reason that thedream of peace in the Middle East has not yet becomea reality. Combating this terror is crucial to theprospects for peace in our region. No peace initiativecan survive if terrorists continue to enjoy a free hand toundermine it.The road map recognizes this  calling  in phaseone  for sustained Palestinian action against terror  thedismantling of terrorist organizations and the end ofincitement in schools and the media. Sadly  the currentPalestinian leadership has refused to fulfil thosefundamental obligations  preferring to blame Israel forall its failures. The Palestinian side spends more energyfighting Israel here at the United Nations than it doesfighting the terrorists in its own territory.In the post-11-September world  this is notacceptable. The Palestinians are not exempt from theimperatives of the global war on terror. On thecontrary  it is in their clear interest to join it. To standup against Hamas and Islamic Jihad is to stand up forPalestinian rights  not against them.We urge the international community to recognizethis reality and help the voices of reform andmoderation within Palestinian society to emerge. Thefuture of the Palestinian people will be determined bythe choices that the Palestinians and their leadershipmake on the ground. The solutions — for thePalestinians and Israelis as one — lie in Gaza andRamallah  not in The Hague or New York.Israel is acting in both the diplomatic and thesecurity arenas to deal with the consequences of thischronic failure of the Palestinian leadership. On thediplomatic front  Israel accepted the road map in May2003  and we remain committed to its realization. Atthis time  however  we have no responsible Palestinianpartner ready to join us in this effort. Israel is nowplanning to implement the disengagement plan as ameans of enhancing security and establishing a new more promising platform for a return to negotiations.We are in constant contact with the donor communityand the World Bank in a joint effort to rebuild Gaza inthe wake of Israel’s withdrawal.On the security front  Israel is building a securityfence to stop the unchecked wave of Palestinianattacks. After 20 000 terrorist attacks  we deserve toprotect our people. No other country would actotherwise after 20  let alone 20 000  terrorist attacks.The fence does not take lives. It saves them. Wherethere is a fence  there is no terror. Where there is nofence  there is terror. The modified route of the fencereflects the necessary balance between the security ofour citizens and the welfare of the Palestinianpopulation  as called for by Israel’s Supreme Court.Most important  the fence is reversible. The lives takenby terror are irreversible. By helping take terrorism outof the equation  the fence contributes to the prospect ofa return to negotiations and the realization of the roadmap’s vision of peace.I call on the Assembly to acknowledge this truthand to reject the continued Palestinian effort to havedelegations address Israel’s response to terrorism instead of addressing the terrorism itself.Ultimately  we need real contact and dialogue based on mutual respect for the humanity of the otherif we are to resolve the conflict in the Middle East. TheGovernment of Israel is ready for such contact. We areready to talk to any leadership — from Syria  Lebanonor the Palestinians — that comes to the table withoutterror and with the genuine intention of findingmutually acceptable solutions to our differences.Tomorrow  Yom Kippur  is a day of prayer fasting and soul-searching for the Jews. In Beersheva in a synagogue named after my father  I will be prayingtogether with those who have recently buried theirmurdered children. I will pray that our collectiveaspiration for life and freedom will prevail over theterrorists and those who sponsor them. I will pray thatGod will deliver peace on earth  for all humanity. AndI will pray that mankind can unite — through the21United Nations — to help make this dream become areality.And I would like to say in Hebrew  Happy NewYear."
"84",3494,"ITA",59,2004,"This year’s general debateunfolds against an international backdrop in whichterrorist acts of great ferocity have become all toocommon. The latest  heinous form of terrorism ishostage-taking  which has caused deep sorrow to manyof our nations. Again and again  the internationalcommunity has been caught off guard  unable torespond quickly or effectively. New humanitariancatastrophes have afflicted some of the world’s poorestpeoples. Difficult stabilization processes are still underway in many regions where the international communityis implementing United Nations resolutions.Some areas of the world have seen economic andsocial progress. Yet we cannot ignore the fact thatentire regions — especially in Africa — are crippledby poverty  malnutrition  disease and illiteracy. That iswhy Italy takes a leading role in combating those ills inmultilateral forums and through bilateral means.Our peoples demand security. We must joinforces to strengthen international cooperation and toconfront the common threat of terrorist organizations.The false prophets of terror are able to spread theirmessage of death as a result of ignorance amongcultures. To counter their distortions  we shouldmobilize people’s consciences and strengthen dialogueamong civilizations with different histories but sharedvalues and a common belief in human dignity.Peace and development — the agenda of securityand human promotion — are related goals that requirea coordinated approach carried out through multilateralinstitutions and in a spirit of equal partnership withdeveloping countries. In that regard  I would like tostress the fundamental importance of a major event thatwill take place in 2005. That initiative will be a uniqueopportunity for a comprehensive review of progresstowards the attainment of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals.In our globalized  interdependent world international organizations are expected to provideleadership not only through abstract formulations ofgeneral principles  but also through effective  sharedinitiatives supported by broad consensus. Our priorityis to strengthen the multilateral system and toreinvigorate the role of the United Nations. That is theresponsibility that the Secretary-General set out for us27at the last session of the General Assembly. There aretwo conditions for success: a sounder understanding ofthe threats we face and a broad consensus on thepolicies aimed at confronting them. Effectivemultilateralism depends much more on political willand shared goals than on structures and procedures.The multilateral system — which demandsresponsibility and commitment — is judged by theresults it enables us to achieve. That is why the wholeinternational community must be involved  startingwith the States that command greater resources andcapabilities. Multilateral decisions can be difficult  butthat is no excuse for inaction.The starting point for United Nations reform is areview of the Organization’s policies. Italy welcomesthe reform of United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building  which we — as the sixth largest contributor tothe United Nations budget and one of the top contributorsof troops to peacekeeping operations over the past 10years — support. Strengthening that critical sector willhelp to prevent the recurrence of conflicts  to consolidatethe gains of peace  to re-establish the rule of law and toguarantee freedom for all. Italy will also continue tosupport the growing financial  operational and trainingdemands of new missions  particularly in Africa —here  I am also thinking about the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development — and elsewhere.Crisis management is a United Nations prioritythat demands greater coordination of its componentsand a stronger commitment on the part of MemberStates to protect human beings and to uphold theirdignity. We thus look forward to the report of the Panelof Eminent Personalities appointed by the Secretary-General. The membership will have to examine it anddiscuss its recommendations thoroughly and openly.A firm agreement on the policies of the UnitedNations must be upheld by institutions that enjoy theconsensus and participation of the membership. We areencouraged by the results achieved so far with regardto improving the functioning of the General Assembly.On Security Council reform  we have not yetbeen able to find an agreement that reconciles thevarious approaches on the table. That should not deter usfrom seeking solutions that are not divisive. Any decisionimposed upon Member States would seriously underminethe credibility of the Council and the legitimacy of itsaction. Confronted with global challenges of greatmagnitude  the international community cannot affordprofound divisions within its ranks.Italy is in favour of a Security Council reforminspired by the principles of greater inclusiveness effectiveness  democratic participation and geographicrepresentation  starting with the developing countries.We are firmly convinced that the best way to pursuesuch a reform is to establish new non-permanent seats.Since States would occupy those seats on the basis ofperiodic elections  they would be accountable to thegeneral membership.Some Member States  however  have advocatedthe addition of new permanent seats — for themselves.We do not believe the Council’s difficulties can beresolved through new permanent  irrevocableappointments and national mandates. Such a movewould sow division  frustration  and perhapsdisengagement  among the membership. Importantareas of the world would be left without representation.For one  there would be no seat at the Council table forthe Arab and Islamic world. Can the internationalcommunity really afford this at a time when we aretrying to broaden the dialogue among different faithsand cultures?On the other hand  if a broad consensus emergeswith full respect for the sovereign equality of allMember States  we are willing to contemplate morefrequent rotation or longer terms for countries thatmake a greater contribution to the objectives of theUnited Nations. Should reflections of the High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change be driven bysuch a bold and innovative approach  we wouldstrongly support their endeavour. I am convinced thatmany other countries would also be ready to accept it.In addition  a closer relationship should be builtbetween elected members and their regional groups.That would enhance the accountability of electedmembers and would make the Council morerepresentative and its deliberations more legitimate.Already in San Francisco in 1945 the foundingfathers recognized the importance of regionalorganizations  whose relations with the United Nationsare governed by Chapter VIII of the Charter  andwhose role has grown steadily in the years thatfollowed. Increasingly  States belonging to the sameregion have felt a sense of common responsibility forcrises affecting them all. Moreover  regional28arrangements provide small to mid-size States with agreater say in the decisions of international forums.More should be done to express those realities atthe United Nations and in the Security Council. As afounding member of the European Union  thedepositary of its treaties and the host for the solemnsignature of the new European Constitution  Italybelieves that today’s 25-member European Union has afundamental contribution to make to the objectives ofthe United Nations. We have always worked to allowthe European Union to speak with a single  moreinfluential  voice. We realize  of course  that we aredealing with a gradual process. Nevertheless  we muststay the course and not jeopardize the achievement ofour goal in the interests of all Europeans.Let me conclude with a final  strong appeal toStates Members. Let us join forces  abandon nationalambitions and seek the least divisive ways to enhancemultilateralism. That is the only way the internationalcommunity can meet the global challenges of the newmillennium. In deciding between the satisfaction of thefew and the inclusion of the many  the wrong choice isa luxury that the United Nations — at the very heart ofthe international system — can ill afford to make."
"85",3540,"JAM",59,2004,"I congratulate you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. You can be assuredof Jamaica’s fullest support and cooperation duringyour tenure.The outgoing President  Julian Hunte of SaintLucia  deserves commendation for his energy andoutstanding leadership during the fifty-eighth session during which he achieved significant accomplishments particularly in the area of the revitalization of theGeneral Assembly. He leaves a legacy of astrengthened presidency and a good foundation forfurther operational improvements in the work of theAssembly and in its relations with other organs.In reviewing the developments of the past year we note that the anticipated growth in the globaleconomy has been dampened by uncertainties arisingfrom macro-economic imbalances in larger economiesand the impact of increased oil prices. Politicalinstability in many regions of the world has not abatedand  in some cases  has increased to critical levels.Many developing countries continue to struggle forsurvival in the globalized economy  especially in theface of changing commodity regimes  the erosion ofpreferences and unfavourable market conditions. Thegap between rich and poor continues to widen. Theremay be some glimmers of hope  but more needs to bedone to correct existing imbalances and to broadenopportunities for all to share in global prosperity.Formidable challenges remain for developingcountries.25In our part of the world  those challenges havetaken on grave new proportions in the wake of therecent spate of hurricanes which have devastated theCaribbean and affected several States of the UnitedStates of America. In the Bahamas  Barbados  Cuba the Cayman Islands  the Dominican Republic  Grenada Haiti and my own country  Jamaica  the loss of life andthe scale of destruction and damage to infrastructure property and means of livelihood have beencatastrophic. What had taken several generations tobuild has suddenly vanished and will take years torecover. The case of Grenada  which was virtuallyobliterated  is particularly striking. For those who havehad doubts about the reality of the vulnerability ofsmall island States  these recent events should beconvincing evidence.In Jamaica  we are completing our estimates ofthe damage from Hurricane Ivan  which struck on10 September  virtually on the anniversary date ofHurricane Gilbert  still painfully fresh in our memory.On behalf of the Government and the people ofJamaica  I extend deep appreciation to the MemberStates  the agencies of the United Nations  and otherinternational and non-governmental organizationswhich have given assistance. We have launched aninternational appeal to support our national efforts forimmediate and long-term recovery. Apart from theprovision of emergency relief supplies  there is a needfor concessionary financing to the affected countries so as to facilitate medium- to long-term reconstruction.One means of doing this would be through theestablishment of a special fund.In the context of these recent developments  the10-year review of the implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action for Small Island DevelopingStates  to be held in Mauritius in January 2005  is atimely opportunity for the international community toundertake special consideration of the vulnerability ofsmall island States. We expect the Mauritius review toadopt concrete measures and call for seriousconsideration to be given to mechanisms to support therecovery and reconstruction efforts of small islanddeveloping States in the aftermath of natural disasters.What should also command attention are thedangers posed by climate change and global warmingand the urgent need for global action within theframework of the Kyoto Protocol. It is imperative thatall States accede to the Protocol.It is accepted that the benefits of globalization arenot being fully realized  especially in the area ofinternational trade. We should seek to harness itspotential to the benefit of developed and developingcountries alike. Interdependence makes this animperative. Global economic health requires bettermanagement of economic arrangements at all levels  toensure a more equitable distribution of globalprosperity.The situation of small developing economiesmakes a compelling case. From any objectivestandpoint  there is a need for special and differentialtreatment in relation to trade  the flow of financialresources  the transfer of technology and the promotionof industrial development. The gap between rich andpoor must be narrowed. Otherwise  many developingcountries will continue in a downward spiral ofdeclining income and increased poverty  with painfulconsequences such as political and social instabilityand recurring humanitarian crises. While there is nosubstitute for self-reliance  on the basis of the principleof shared responsibility  there is a role for allparticipants within the global economic system.That is why international cooperation fordevelopment should be given a central place in ourdeliberations. There is a need to create institutionalcapacity in the United Nations for the direction andcoordination of policies affecting finance  trade andtechnology and for formulating the overall policiesguiding international economic cooperation. Such amechanism could forge effective linkages with theBretton Woods institutions in order to manage andpromote coherence in international economicprogrammes and policies. It should effectively respondto economic crises as they arise and apply remedies forimbalances and disequilibrium in the global economy.Some tentative steps have been taken in thatdirection in the wake of the Monterrey Conference  butmuch more is required to reform governance in theinternational economic system to make it moredemocratic  transparent and responsive to the realneeds and priorities of developing countries.The cycle of violence resulting from war andterrorism is a troubling phenomenon of our time.International security is dangerously at risk. What isclear to us is that violence and the use of force cannotbe the answer. We must embrace multilateralism and26insist that international relations be guided by the ruleof law as the basis for our collective security.Against that background  the necessary stepsmust be taken to strengthen multilateralism. TheUnited Nations must be our instrument of choice.There is no viable alternative to the Organization  andit can be made as effective as it needs to be only if it isgiven the powers and resources that are required. Wemust continue to nourish and strengthen it and makeadaptations in the face of changing realities to improveits effectiveness and enhance its credibility. Reformcould begin with the Security Council  to make it morerepresentative in membership  more democratic in itsdecision-making and more accountable and transparentin its operations. These are necessary for itseffectiveness and legitimacy. We look forward toreceiving the recommendations of the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges andChange.The improvement of international securitydepends on our finding durable solutions to regionalconflicts and disputes. In Africa  there is a need toexpedite relief for humanitarian emergencies  topromote initiatives aimed at resolving internecineconflicts and to advance the struggle for economic andsocial progress. We are distressed by the deteriorationin the political and humanitarian situation in the Darfurregion of the Sudan  and we support constructiveefforts to bring an end to the disruption and thebloodshed. We commend the role of the African Unionaimed at resolving the crisis.We continue to call for good sense and wisdom todefuse the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Jamaica believesthat only through a process of political accommodationand the settlement of legitimate claims and grievances on the basis of justice and legality  can there be anyhope for a durable peace.The war in Iraq has opened up furthercomplexities and further divisions and is becoming adangerous source of continuing conflict. A politicalsolution is needed to bring about nationalreconciliation and peace.Small countries face particular dangers inmaintaining stability and security. I am referring to theincreasing production  distribution and proliferation ofsmall arms and light weapons and of sophisticatedammunition. These represent our greatest securitythreat. Small States do not produce these weapons  butthey have become the principal victims of them. Theinflux of these weapons through various illicit channelsis fuelling civil conflict and criminal violence whoseextent and intensity beleaguer and often overwhelmnational security forces. It is estimated in the 2004Small Arms Survey that the proliferation and misuse ofsmall arms contributes annually to approximately200 000 to 270 000 civilian deaths  40 per cent ofwhich are concentrated in the Latin American andCaribbean region.Equally disturbing to us is the insufficientappreciation of these dangers by those countries thatare the producers and source of the weapons. Wemaintain that such States have a duty to prevent illicittransfers beyond their borders. Additionally  we needmore effective cooperation to regulate and restrict themovement of these weapons and to have effectiveregistration and monitoring of transfers  operatingwithin a framework of legally binding obligations.For that reason  it is urgent that we move toconclude the negotiations for an internationalconvention to achieve those objectives. We make thisdemand for action on the basis of the principle of theequal right to security for all States. The threats anddangers we face are as valid as those arising from theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Thesealso demand collective action; and  in this  Jamaica hasbeen unrelenting in its support of effective measuresaimed at curtailing the spread of nuclear and otherweapons of mass destruction.The year 2004 was declared the InternationalYear for the Commemoration of the Struggle AgainstSlavery and its Abolition. Our history makes this aspecial commemoration. We also celebrate the 200thanniversary of the independence of Haiti. The Haitianrevolution was an achievement of immense historicalimportance that significantly influenced the shaping ofthe modern world. It established the first free nation inthe Western Hemisphere  and it struck the first decisiveblow that eventually brought about the overthrow ofthe system of slavery in the Americas. The revolutionwas a story of heroism and triumph  creating a legacythat has sustained the Haitian people during a long andoften lonely struggle for survival over the years  in theharsh realties of a hostile world of racism anddiscrimination.Sadly  the bicentennial celebration has beenovershadowed by circumstances of instability and27political crisis that continue even now. The events ofFebruary still cast a shadow and leave lingeringconcerns about how the democratically electedPresident demitted office. The sequence of events andthe timing of the Security Council in reacting to thecrisis were unfortunate. At the same time  Jamaicarecognizes that Haiti requires the support andassistance of the international community  which mustbe sustained over the long term to ensure itseffectiveness. The rebuilding of democracy and thecreation of a stable social  economic and political ordercannot be accomplished overnight  and therefore itshould be pursued with perseverance and thecommitment of the necessary resources.We share the anguish and grief of the people ofHaiti at the tragic loss of life and devastation caused bythe recent hurricane. The Caribbean Community willcontinue to do its part in providing emergencyassistance.This year  we commemorate the tenth anniversaryof the establishment of the International SeabedAuthority. For all of us  and for Jamaica  that is asignificant milestone in the quiet evolution andpromotion of a legal regime for the seabed  whichembodies the principle of the common heritage ofmankind. What we  as a community  can take from thisto other spheres of international relations is theimportance of upholding the rule of law and the pre-eminence of the principles of justice and equity. TheSecretary-General rightly emphasized the importanceof those norms last Tuesday when introducing hisreport on the work of the Organization (A/59/1).The international community should not standidly by in the presence of violations of internationallaw and the promotion of doctrines that run counter tothe principles of multilateralism. That is why Jamaicaasks of this fifty-ninth session that all States recommitthemselves to the principles on which the Organizationwas founded to promote peace  equality and justice forall its Members. Let us take the necessary steps to putthose principles into practice and to make them thefoundation of our policies and programmes. Ouruniversal objective must be to implement the nobleideals to which we subscribe  not just to articulatethem."
"86",3586,"JOR",59,2004,"First  Iwish to warmly congratulate you  Sir  on your electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession.The most recent Arab Human DevelopmentReport of the United Nations Development Programmeidentified the pressing challenges facing the Arabworld both now and in the future. Thus  it contributedto triggering a broad debate on the future of reform inthe Middle East.Partly in response  the Tunis Arab Summitadopted in May 2004 a document on the process ofdevelopment  modernization and reform in the Arabworld with a view to improving joint Arab action. Thatplatform paper highlighted the need to consolidatedemocratic principles and to broaden the base ofpolitical participation. It also called for intensifyingefforts to improve performance in the political economic  social and educational areas by: giving moreattention to youth issues  the advancement of womenand the modernization of social institutions throughoutthe Arab world; improving education; completing theArab common market plan; and laying out a pan-Arabeconomic development strategy. Jordan  for its part supports this vision  which is in line with the plans wehave already been pursuing within our national reformagenda.Jordan believes that for reform to be trulymeaningful it has to emanate first and foremost fromwithin society and be sensitive to the particularcharacteristics and needs of each country. Accordingly we in Jordan sought to develop an integrated agendathat addresses the primary issues of concern to ourcitizens throughout the country. Those include broaderpolitical development and personal freedoms  greaterroles for women and youth  a more efficient judiciarysystem  educational reform and the achievement ofsteady economic growth with a view to improving theliving conditions of all individuals  leading to a moreprogressive  open and tolerant society.Within the same framework  the Government ofJordan sought to strengthen the partnership betweenthe public and private sectors  both inside Jordan and atthe larger  Arab regional level. The most recent inter-Arab initiative was launched by Arab private sector12and grass-roots civil organizations  with activeJordanian participation  in Amman on the margin of theWorld Economic Forum  which was convened at theDead Sea last May. That initiative laid the foundationfor the delineation of a vision for the Middle East forthe year 2010. A well-developed plan of action will belaid out at the Davos World Economic Forum in 2005.The plan will provide a framework for pooling andanalysing constructive inputs and proposing answersfor the challenges facing Jordan and the region ingeneral.However  the series of reform measures currentlyunder way in Jordan will be inadequate without thesupport of the international community. The help weneed involves support for our development projects direct assistance to the Jordanian economy and foreigndebt relief. Of special significance in this regard is theaid needed and expected from the Group of Eightindustrial Powers to Jordan’s plans and initiatives which have been based on positive  realistic andsustainable goals.The long-standing status quo in our region hasmade virtually impossible all serious efforts to forgeahead with the overall Middle East reform exercise.The creation of a favourable climate that helpsaccelerate regional development and progress dependson the termination of the Israeli occupation of Arabland on the basis of international legality with a viewto ensuring security and stability in the region.The time has indeed come to focus on starting thepeace process on the basis of the road map and theterms of reference it contains  including the Arab peaceinitiative and implementation by both the Israeli andPalestinian sides of their respective obligations underthe road map. In fact  the road map provides a well-defined vision of the ultimate solution of thePalestinian-Israeli conflict  namely the vision putforward by President George Bush of the United Statesof two States living side by side in peace. PresidentBush reaffirmed that position in a letter he sent lastMay to His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Al Hussein.The letter also elaborated the firm position of theUnited States  which rejects any measures that wouldprejudice the outcome of final status negotiations onthe basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)and 338 (1973).The launching of any serious political processrequires immediate action on the part of all parties toput an end to violence and to all forms of killing ofcivilians. Let me recall here that  according to the roadmap  the obligations of both sides must be carried outin concert. For its part  Israel should fulfil itscommitments  beginning with the cessation of allsettlement building and all extrajudicial killings. At thesame time  the Palestinian side should complete thereforms required to control the security situation in theoccupied Palestinian territories and bring violence toan end. In that regard  we welcome the decision toconsolidate the Palestinian security apparatus. Israel’sannouncement of its unilateral withdrawal from Gaza however  must be effected as an integral part of theroad map and within its terms of reference. Thewithdrawal must be coordinated with all partiesconcerned  especially the Palestinian side  in order toensure a smooth transfer of power.It has become abundantly clear  now perhapsmore than ever before  that there is a real need todevelop an effective monitoring mechanism  operatedby the Quartet  to ascertain whether all parties meettheir mutual obligations and to ensure the scrupulousimplementation of the road map by the two sides intheir progress towards a successful conclusion. Here  Iwish to pay tribute to the Quartet for its persistentefforts to maintain the momentum of the peace process.Once again  I wish to reaffirm Jordan’scommitment  along with that of all other Arab States to the Arab peace initiative which the Arab Summitadopted in Beirut in 2002 with a view to putting an endto the Arab-Israeli conflict through the conclusion of acollective peace agreement providing for the securityof all countries in the region and laying the foundationfor the establishment of relations with Israel. Theagreement would also create a framework for asolution to the Palestinian refugee problem on the basisof General Assembly resolution 194 (III)  a full Israeliwithdrawal from the Arab territories occupied in 1967and the establishment of an independent  sovereign andviable Palestinian State.Jordan stresses the need to respect and implementthe advisory opinion of the International Court ofJustice (ICJ) on the separation wall being built byIsrael in the occupied Palestinian territories. Thepronouncement of the International Court of Justice isthe law  and no peaceful settlement of the Palestinianquestion can be realized unless it is based onobservance of the rules of international law and therecognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian13people  including the right to self-determination. Inthat regard  the Court’s opinion was both clear andspecific on the following points.First  the West Bank  including East Jerusalem  isan occupied territory and  under international law Israel is an occupying Power. Accordingly  the claimthat the West Bank  including East Jerusalem  is a“disputed territory” has been dismissed once and forall.Second  the relevant rules of internationalhumanitarian law are applicable to the occupiedPalestinian territories  including The HagueRegulations of 1907 and the Fourth GenevaConvention of 1949  which  according to theInternational Court of Justice  are legally applicable tothat territory.Third  the Palestinian people have the right toself-determination and Israel is violating that right incontravention of the binding norms of internationallaw.Fourth  the Israeli settlements built in theterritories occupied in 1967  including East Jerusalem are in breach of the rules of international humanitarianlaw.Fifth  the construction by Israel of the wall in theoccupied Palestinian territories  including EastJerusalem  is illegal. Furthermore  Israel must cease itsviolations relating to the construction of the wall by inter alia  dismantling those portions of it erected in theoccupied Palestinian territories  reinstating the rights ofthe owners whose lands were lost and compensatingthose who incurred losses as a result of Israel’s illegalactions.Sixth  the construction of the wall and its routecreate a fait accompli on the ground which couldbecome permanent and which  in that case  would betantamount to the actual annexation of the occupiedPalestinian territories.Seventh  the international community is under alegal obligation to refrain from abetting Israel in itsillegal activities and is prohibited from recognizing theillegal situation effected by the construction of theseparation wall.Accordingly  Jordan welcomes General Assemblyresolution ES-10/15 and considers it an important step reflecting the international community’s recognition ofthe legal conclusions of the International Court ofJustice and its desire to take practical steps to enforceit.The separation wall threatens the nationalsecurity of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The wallis not only a barrier to the establishment of a viableindependent Palestinian State  but it also partitions theWest Bank into three distinct  isolated sections.Moreover  and in view of the arbitrary Israeli closuresand restrictions on movement  the occupied Palestinianterritories are witnessing an unprecedented level ofdeterioration in every aspect of their political  social economic  security and humanitarian situation. This isbound to have a spill-over effect on neighbouringcountries  especially Jordan.That is the backdrop against which Jordansupported the efforts leading to the adoption of theInternational Court of Justice advisory opinion andAssembly resolution ES-10/15. Jordan will continue tosupport the Palestinian people in its efforts to establishan independent State on its national territory  on thebasis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973)  1397 (2002) and 1515 (2003)  the principle ofland for peace  the road map and the Arab peaceinitiative. We also stand ready to provide anyassistance that the Palestinian side might seek to help itto reform its administrative and security structures witha view to fulfilling its obligations under the road map.Jordan welcomes the formation of the interimIraqi Government and the restoration of Iraqisovereignty at the end of last June. In that regard  wewish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations and his Special Adviser  Mr. LakhdarBrahimi  for their unrelenting efforts  whichculminated in the formation of the interim Governmentdespite the enormous odds they encountered at everystage of the process.Jordan underscores its support for theGovernment of Iraq and stands ready to lend allpossible assistance to Iraq  its people and Governmentin the forthcoming phase in order to enable the countryto rebuild its institutions  manage its own affairs andrecover its regional and international status. Theongoing transition in Iraq and the need for it to developits political and economic processes require thecooperation of all parties. With support  the Iraqipeople will be able to determine their political futurewithout external intervention  gain control of their14natural resources and preserve Iraq’s territorialintegrity.Despite overwhelming odds and the currentinstability  it is our hope that elections for thetransitional national assembly and the formation of atransitional Government will be completed by the endof January 2005. Jordan calls upon all States to provideevery possible assistance towards the achievement ofthose goals. The United Nations obviously has apivotal role to play in ensuring a successful outcome.In that regard  we welcome the appointment by theSecretary-General of his Special Representative forIraq  Mr. Ashraf Jehangir Qazi  and express ourwillingness to fully cooperate with him in order toensure the complete and smooth fulfilment of theUnited Nations mandate in Iraq as set forth in SecurityCouncil resolution 1546 (2004).In the meantime  Jordan strongly condemnsviolence  the killing of civilians and beheadings inIraq. We remain committed to helping our Iraqibrothers in the training of Iraqi police and army unitsin order to enable them to improve their capacity torestore control over the security situation  as well asthrough the provision of necessary humanitarianassistance. It is indeed regrettable that there is still atiny minority representing extremist movements andorganizations that seek political power by means ofintimidation and violence under the false pretext ofIslamic action. Such groups exploit Islam as a meansof achieving political or even personal gain byresorting to violence and terrorism and thus unfortunately  tarnishing the image of Islam  a faith ofmoderation and tolerance.We also condemn all acts of terror  includingthose gruesome and blind acts perpetrated in Madridand Beslan  which require our firm collective stand incombating them.The events of 11 September 2001 marked a newera of immense challenge to the internationalcommunity in terms of dealing with the repercussionsand implications of such events. Fighting internationalterrorism entails taking measures that affectinternational relations and the principles that haveguided States since the creation of the United Nationsand the adoption of its Charter.In our view  a meaningful and effective globalcampaign against terrorism requires consensus on thefollowing principles: Respect for the provisions of theCharter and the rules of international law  and non-transgression against the sovereignty of States; strikinga balance between the counter-terrorism measurestaken by States and the principles of human rights public freedoms and non-abuse of the state ofemergency to justify counter-terrorism measures;providing a clear and specific legal definition of“terrorism” as well as of the concept of “terroristgroups” that would not allow any legal justification forthe commission of terrorist acts. By the same token such definitions should not compromise the rightsenvisioned in the Charter and in the provisions ofinternational humanitarian law  such as the right toself-determination.In the same vein  combating global terrorismought not be a tool for discrimination against thefollowers of any creed or a cover for assault againsttheir religious beliefs. Finally  the “no justification forterror” policy should not lead to disregard for itsunderlying causes. Rather  an effective battle againstterrorism would require global cooperation inaddressing its root causes and the genesis of thephenomenon.I am pleased to announce that the Government ofJordan has welcomed the formation of the High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change to examinethe modalities for improving the performance of theUnited Nations in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security and its reform in general. Wesupport the exercise undertaken by the Panel and lookforward to receiving its recommendations at the end ofthe year.We share the vision  laid out by the Secretary-General in his reports to the General Assembly  thatreform is a continuous  comprehensive and dynamicprocess that must include all political  economic administrative and financial activities of the UnitedNations. We also believe that  if reform is to succeed genuine partnership between Member Statesrepresented by the regional groups and the Secretariatof the United Nations is required. In this regard  webelieve that the thrust of reform should be anupgrading of efficiency and not a reduction in theexpenditures or in the budget of the Organization.Therefore  a set of benchmarks must be developed toassess performance. In the meantime  there should beno room for the random setting of agenda priorities orfor selectivity in implementing reform.15Regarding reform of the Security Council  Iwould be remiss if I failed to commend the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of EquitableRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership ofthe Security Council and Other Matters related to theSecurity Council. Jordan supports the principle ofincreasing membership in both permanent and rotatingseats in order to make the Council more representativeof the United Nations membership.In this regard  Jordan is of the view that theresponsibilities of Council members should bereconsidered in order to ensure that all members havethe capacity and political will to contribute effectivelyto peacekeeping operations by way of meeting theirobligations under the Charter. The contribution bySecurity Council members of human resources topeacekeeping field operations  not just of financial andequipment inputs  is an essential requirement for thesuccess of those operations. This is indeed a primaryresponsibility that must be met by members of theSecurity Council  especially the permanent ones. Inaddition  we think that effective operations require thedevelopment of a flexible mechanism that allows theadoption of clear resolutions by the Council  in closecoordination with troop-contributing countries that arenot members of the Council  as well as functioning in atransparent framework.In closing  let me once again thank you  Sir. Iwould also like to wish this session of the GeneralAssembly every success as I pray to almighty God toguide us to better serve our people and to live up to theresponsibilities entrusted to us."
"87",3633,"JPN",59,2004,"Today  the internationalcommunity is striving to meet challenges that thefounders of the United Nations could not haveenvisioned sixty years ago. The fight against terrorismand efforts to ensure non-proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction are just a few examples of thosechallenges.Japan has always pursued internationalcooperation centring on the United Nations. As theinternational community faces new realities  the UnitedNations must adapt and address them.The United Nations was created to bring about apeaceful  prosperous  and just world. To that end Member States have united their strengths to promoteinternational cooperation. Convinced that it cancontribute to creating a better world through its owncapabilities  Japan has endeavoured steadfastly to fulfilits role as a responsible United Nations Member. Ouractivities in Iraq and Afghanistan offer excellentexamples.In Iraq  based on the relevant Security Councilresolutions  Japan has joined international efforts toassist in the Iraqi people's own struggle towards ademocratic and prosperous nation. Japan has beencooperating with the Iraqi people to help them improvetheir daily life and rebuild the foundation of theirpublic life.The humanitarian and reconstruction activities ofJapanís Self-Defence Forces and its financialassistance of $5 billion are working in tandem to thatend. In order to promote international solidarity  Japanwill host the third Meeting of the Donorsí Committeeof the International Reconstruction Fund Facility forIraq next month.In Afghanistan  Japan has from the verybeginning taken the lead in assisting nationalreconstruction efforts. Japan hosted the InternationalConference on Reconstruction Assistance toAfghanistan in January 2002. Japan has been activelypromoting Afghan efforts for disarmament demobilization and reintegration. The Afghan peopleare working hard to prepare for presidential as well asparliamentary elections. Those elections are the most32important milestones for a new  democraticAfghanistan.The international community and the UnitedNations must stand by the Afghan and Iraqi peoples intheir strenuous efforts to rebuild their countries.Weapons of mass destruction  missiles andterrorism threaten international security in todayísworld. Japan is the only country ever to have sufferednuclear devastation. As such  Japan has been at theforefront in promoting nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Japan hopes to achieve a peaceful andsafe world free of nuclear weapons. Furthermore Japan has collaborated with other countries to preventStates of concern and non-State actors from acquiringweapons of mass destruction.We must allow no room for terrorism to prevail.In the fight against terrorism  Japan is doing its utmostto strengthen domestic legislation and relatedmeasures  and will continue to cooperate with othercountries.The nuclear and missile issues on the Koreanpeninsula present a serious challenge to the peace andstability of north-east Asia and to the internationalcommunity as a whole. Japan is determined to continueto seek a comprehensive resolution of the nuclear andmissile issues and the abduction issue in line with thePyongyang Declaration. The six-party talks must goforward. The benefit that the Democratic PeopleísRepublic of Korea would receive by resolving thoseissues would be substantial. There is no benefit for it incontinuing to pursue its nuclear programme.After the Second World War  Japan experienced adramatic economic recovery  with the help of theinternational community. On the basis of our ownexperience  we are keenly aware that  in promotinginternational cooperation  self-help efforts are essentialto overcoming difficulties and achieving a prosperoussociety. Japanís official development assistancetherefore has been based on the principles of ownershipand partnership.Environmental conservation must also proceedhand in hand with economic development. Japan hastaken the lead in global efforts in such areas as climatechange and environmental protection.In addressing development challenges  includingthe Millennium Development Goals  Japan will moveforward  making further efforts for the strategic andeffective use of official development assistance bearing those principles in mind.The protection and empowerment of individualsand communities is the foundation of internationalpeace and security. That is why Japan is advocating theconcept of human security. Based upon that idea  Japanis making efforts to realize a seamless transition fromhumanitarian assistance to reconstruction support incountries such as Afghanistan  Sri Lanka andTimor-Leste.It is my strong belief that there can be no stabilityand prosperity in the world unless Africaís issues areresolved. Japan initiated the process of the TokyoInternational Conference on African Development(TICAD) in 1993. Last year  Japan organizedTICAD III  with the participation of 89 countries and47 international organizations. African countries arenow promoting regional collaboration through theAfrican Union and working to implement the NewPartnership for Africaís Development (NEPAD).The collaboration between TICAD and NEPAD issignificant  because both processes are grounded in theprinciples of ownership and partnership. A stable andprosperous Africa depends upon the promotion of tradeand investment  together with official developmentassistance. This autumn  Japan will host the TICADAsia-Africa Trade and Investment Conference.Today  in Africa  we are witnessing the unfoldingof another humanitarian crisis. We share theinternational communityís grave concern over Darfur.Japan has decided to provide humanitarian assistanceof $21 million. In addition  Japan intends to provide in-kind assistance to the Sudanese refugees in Chad.In East Asia  there has been remarkable economicdevelopment. Japan has been working with thecountries in the region to build solid foundations fortheir own efforts towards economic development. Inthat region  active efforts are also under way to fostercommunity-building. Building upon the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Plus Three  I haveadvocated the idea of an East Asia community.This year  Japan is a candidate for non-permanentmembership on the Security Council. Japan  if elected will redouble its efforts to play a constructive andinnovative role in the Council  based on its globalcontributions.33As the international community rises to meet thechallenges we face in todayís world  the UnitedNations must not be left on the sidelines. We need astrong and effective United Nations. Indeed  we mustcreate a new United Nations for the new era. I applaudthe timely initiative by the Secretary-General ofestablishing the High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change. I trust that the Panel willpresent the Secretary-General with a bold andambitious plan for reforming the United Nations.Peace and security  and economic and socialissues are increasingly intertwined. The response of theUnited Nations must be coordinated andcomprehensive. United Nations agencies and organsmust be effective and efficient. Changes are neededthroughout the United Nations system.The reform of the Security Council must be at thecore of those changes. In recent years  the role of theSecurity Council has expanded dramatically in scopeand nature. The Security Council must fulfil itsexpanded role  with the maximum cooperation andparticipation of the international community.To that end  the Security Council must improveits representation to better reflect today's world. Inaddition  the Council must be provided with adequateresources to address challenges effectively. Countrieswith the will and the resources to play a major role ininternational peace and security must always take partin the Councilís decision-making process. The SecurityCouncil therefore needs to be expanded  both in itspermanent and non-permanent categories  adding newmembers from both developing and developedcountries.The universal purpose of the United Nations óour common goal - is to maintain international peaceand security. In striving towards that goal  eachMember State must fulfil its role  commensurate withits own capabilities.It is our conviction that peace cannot be achievedthrough force alone. On the basis of that conviction Japan has played an active and distinctive role. Japanhas made considerable resources available for UnitedNations peacekeeping operations  as well as forreconstruction efforts to assist in the consolidation ofpeace. Japanís Self-Defense Forces have conductedhumanitarian and reconstruction activities in such areasas Timor-Leste and Iraq.Such global contributions to peace are rooted inthe fundamental  cherished beliefs of the Japanesepeople  who have been seeking an honoured place in aninternational community that strives for peace andprosperity. Those contributions are  I believe  greatlyappreciated by the international community.Recent United Nations peace operations showthat there are many dimensions to the achievement andconsolidation of peace. Making peace a reality requirescomprehensive efforts  ranging from peace-building tonation-building. Japan's role has thus becomeincreasingly vital to the maintenance of internationalpeace and security  which is precisely the mandate ofthe Security Council. We believe that the role thatJapan has played provides a solid basis for itsassumption of permanent membership of the SecurityCouncil.In order to better reflect today's world  it is alsonecessary to remove the 'enemy State' clauses fromthe Charter  as the General Assembly has alreadyrecognized those provisions to be obsolete.The scale of assessments for Member Statesneeds to be more balanced.Next year  the United Nations will celebrate itssixtieth anniversary. We will hold a high-level plenarymeeting to review progress on all of the commitmentsin the Millennium Declaration. Development  globalsecurity and United Nations reform are all high on theagenda. Changes are needed on all fronts. The time hascome to make a historic decision to reform the UnitedNations  and the Security Council in particular.Time is limited. Our future - the future of theUnited Nations - is at stake. I would like to call uponthe members of this body to work together and take abold step towards the creation of a new United Nationsfor the new era."
"88",3658,"KAZ",59,2004,"First of all  Sir  let meadd my voice to the congratulations on your election tothe high office of President of the General Assembly atits fifty-ninth session and express confidence that under your leadership  it will be successful and fruitful.I would like to begin by supporting the statementof Secretary-General Kofi Annan concerning thecrucial importance of fostering the rule of law  both athome and in the framework of international relations 29for the solution of the topical issues of the modernworld.Today  the whole system of international relationsis under vicious attack. We are witnessing the growingreach and brutality of international terrorism andorganized crime  the alarming degradation of ourenvironment and the spread of poverty  misery anddisease.Every year  we keep repeating that the challengesand threats to humanity have become global and thatthe international community should make joint effortsto address these challenges effectively and withdetermination. But  with our words still resonating inthe air  these problems continue to place a heavyburden on human beings.For years  the international community has beenignoring the most burning problems of social andeconomic development and has failed to addresspoverty  misery  illiteracy and various forms ofdiscrimination. As a result  we are faced with anunprecedented threat of international terrorism  whichundermines the pillars of the world economy andsecurity. Nevertheless  we have not yet done anythingmeaningful to get a detailed analysis of the ideologybehind international terrorism  its institutional base andits sources of financing. In other words  the centralnature of international terrorism remains terraincognita for all of us; we are familiar only with itsugly manifestations.Recent alarming developments in the world especially the massacre in Beslan  have againhighlighted the urgent need to reform the UnitedNations. We cannot meet new challenges and addresstoday’s acute problems if we continue to rely on oldapproaches. The central issue of international securityis turning the United Nations into an effective tooldesigned to strengthen regional and global securitysystems  the regime of non-proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction and management of globalizationprocesses.As a matter of principle  we consider it importantto ensure balance in the functioning of the GeneralAssembly  the Security Council and the Economic andSocial Council  as envisioned in the Charter of thisOrganization. We insist on the need to strengthen therole of the General Assembly in the settlement of themost important issues facing humanity today. In ourview  the international community’s efforts to combatterrorism and to settle armed conflicts can be moreeffective only on the basis of such an approach.Kazakhstan has supported the Secretary-General’s decision to establish a high-level panel onUnited Nations reform. We believe that this panel  withits broad mandate and wide-ranging powers  shouldarrive at an acceptable solution to this present crucialissue. Kazakhstan holds the view that  in its currentform  the Security Council no longer reflects therealities of our world. I share the opinion of the PrimeMinister of Japan  Mr. Junichiro Koizumi  that the“enemy State” clauses in the United Nations Charterare obsolete. The Security Council should berevitalized by the addition of new permanent and non-permanent members. Asia  Africa and Latin Americashould have a wider representation in the SecurityCouncil and should be directly involved in the searchfor solutions to the important problems facing theinternational community.Kazakhstan calls for the establishment of acouncil of regional organizations under the auspices ofthe United Nations Secretary-General. Close attentionshould be paid to the proposal to establish an economicand social security council. We believe that theseproposals reflect the need to strengthen globalmultilateral cooperation.Our country continues to believe that the UnitedNations is the only genuinely universal internationalorganization responsible for the issues of war andpeace  acting as a guarantor of international law.It is encouraging that the reform of the UnitedNations Security Council Counter-TerrorismCommittee is gaining momentum. With the currentescalation of international terrorism  the role of thisCommittee should become more important; otherwise global counter-terrorism efforts to address newchallenges and threats will not be so effective  and thisruns counter to the wishes of the peoples of the world.Mr. Belkhadem (Algeria) Vice-President  took theChair.Our country supports the United Nationspeacekeeping effort and the continued strengthening ofits capacity in this area. With escalating humanitariancrises and armed conflicts  as effectively demonstratedby the developments in Darfur  the United Nationsshould pay special attention to the possibility ofbroader participation by authoritative regional and30subregional organizations in peacekeeping operations which would allow a more effective and timelyresponse to emerging threats.Yet  one key issue is the prevention of conflictsand crises. For this reason  Kazakhstan is a firmsupporter of preventive diplomacy and continues tobelieve that the establishment of a Central Asianpreventive diplomacy centre is a timely initiative.In our view  there is an urgent need to coordinatethe efforts of the entire international community in thearea of disarmament and arms control. We call for anearly entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and urge the Governments of thoseStates that have not yet ratified this instrument todisplay political will and genuine commitment tonuclear disarmament.As one of the few States that have voluntarilygiven up their nuclear weapons  Kazakhstan isconcerned by the current status of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This important treaty has beenseriously eroded because of destructive actions on thepart of a number of known States. We should recognizethat the non-proliferation regime faces a formidablethreat  and there is a real possibility of an uncontrolledspread of weapons of mass destruction and  mostimportant  of terrorists getting hold of them. In view ofthis  we consider the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia to be a veryimportant and timely proposal.We believe that the negotiation process within theConference on Disarmament in Geneva should bereactivated. In our view  the potential of this importantforum is far from being tapped to its full extent.The Government of Kazakhstan attaches greatimportance to the consistent implementation of theProgramme of Action to Prevent  Combat andEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and LightWeapons  as discussed at a regional conference inAlmaty in March of 2004.For us  it is very important that the Iraqi issue isagain in the political realm of the United Nations.Emphasizing the need to ensure the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq  Kazakhstanwelcomes the transfer of authority and responsibilityfor the administration of the country to the InterimGovernment of Iraq and calls on the Iraqi people tocome together in the name of national unity andconciliation.The participation of a unit of the armed forces ofKazakhstan in the multinational force in Iraq is ademonstration of our country’s commitment to theimplementation of its obligations towards themaintenance of international peace and security.Continued instability in the Middle East is amatter of grave concern to Kazakhstan. From our pointof view  the resumption and advancement of the peaceprocess  on all tracks  and the implementation by allparties to the conflict in the Middle East of theircommitments  as reflected in the road map and relevantSecurity Council resolutions  should remain the maingoal of all those concerned.Kazakhstan supports the efforts of the currentGovernment in Afghanistan to consolidate peace andsecurity in the country and address social  economicand humanitarian issues. We expect that theinternational community  starting with all thedeveloped countries  will live up to their commitmentswith regard to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan. As forour country  we are ready to contribute to the process within our means.We believe that the well-being of the CentralAsian region is largely dependent on the normalizationof the situation in Afghanistan. We have every reasonto be concerned by such problems as the increasingspread of drugs  illegal migration and surging religiousextremism. Together with poverty  ecologicaldegradation and the lack of water resources  thesephenomena provide a breeding ground for internationalterrorism  which is gaining force in our region.In view of that  Kazakhstan supports the activitiesof the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime inCentral Asia  particularly the adoption of a regionalplan of action to control the illicit spread of drugs inthe States neighbouring Afghanistan and theestablishment of a security belt around that country.We believe that the deployment in Afghanistan —under the auspices of NATO — of the InternationalSecurity Assistance Force is an important factor in therestoration of peace and security in the country.Kazakhstan’s initiative regarding the Conferenceon Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures inAsia (CICA) — already a fact of international life — isan effective tool designed to strengthen confidence and31security in Asia. The first CICA summit  held in Juneof 2002  became a milestone in that process and pavedthe way for practical efforts to institutionalize theConference.The draft catalogue of confidence-buildingmeasures and the draft rules of procedure have alreadybeen agreed and are expected to be adopted at aministerial meeting of the CICA countries  scheduledto be held in October 2004 in Almaty. The adoption ofthe catalogue will create a unique documentencompassing a range of measures in the military political  economic  cultural and environmental areasdesigned to strengthen security and confidence in Asia.As a newly independent State  Kazakhstan wantsto contribute to global harmony and stability. The factthat our multi-ethnic State enjoys a large degree ofinter-confessional and inter-ethnic accord says a lot;first of all  it is a confirmation that Kazakhstan hasbecome an integral part of the civilized community. Wecategorically reject the concept of the clash ofcivilizations and consider it to be counterproductiveand harmful  because it serves as a justification forinternational conflicts and the barbaric actions ofinternational terrorists.Kazakhstan firmly believes that dialogue andharmony among civilizations are not only possible butalso necessary. For that reason  our head of Stateinitiated a congress of world religions  held in Astanain September of 2003. The success of that forum hasstrengthened our conviction that it is absolutelyessential to establish a dialogue and ensure peacefulcoexistence between religions and civilizations  in theinterests of peace and global security.Kazakhstan reaffirms its strong commitment tointegration and multilateral cooperation at the regionallevel. This approach  which promotes the sustainablesocial and economic development of Kazakhstan  isfully within our long-term interests. Such institutionsas the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  theEurasian Economic Community  the Organization ofCentral Asian Cooperation and the EconomicCooperation Organization play an ever-increasing rolein the efforts to strengthen security  develop economiccooperation and create conditions for the prosperity ofour large region.We have great expectations regarding integrationwithin the framework of the single economic spacemade up of the territories of Belarus  Kazakhstan Russia and Ukraine. Our country also supports thestrengthening of the capacity of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States (CIS) as a major and influentialinternational organization. Recently  PresidentNursultan Nazarbaev has made concrete proposalsconcerning the reform of the Commonwealth.Kazakhstan reaffirms its commitment to theimplementation of its obligations towards theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europeand hopes that the upcoming ministerial meeting inSofia will develop new approaches to the reform ofthat organization in order to adapt it to new challengesemerging from our region. We also commend theresults of the cooperation with NATO within theframework of its Partnership for Peace programme andconsider the possibility of increasing the level of ourcooperation with that alliance.Kazakhstan continues to pay priority attention tothe development of its cooperation with Russia  theUnited States  China  the countries of Central Asia  theEuropean Union and the Asian and Islamic countries.We are now in a position to claim considerableprogress in that area  which has allowed us to createfavourable external conditions for liberal reforms inthe country. Having been given the status of a marketeconomy and enjoying a high rating in the financialcommunity  Kazakhstan has been recognized by theinternational community as a leader among the post-Soviet States in practically all economic indicators including direct foreign investments.We welcome the start of a direct dialoguebetween the Central Asian States and Japan andconsider that form of cooperation to be verymeaningful and promising. We also attach greatimportance to the partnership between our region andthe United States in order to create a zone of free trade.The Almaty Programme of Action  adopted bythe International Ministerial Conference of Landlockedand Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countriesand International Financial and DevelopmentInstitutions on Transit Transport Cooperation  held inAugust of 2003 in my country  has provided to thelandlocked Central Asian States an important tool forthe solution of their trade and transit problems. Wehope that the needs of inland States will be duly takeninto account in trade negotiations in order to provideappropriate privileges and preferences to that group ofcountries.32It is a well-established fact that the transportationpolicies of many countries  including Kazakhstan  areclosely linked to the delivery of hydrocarbons to worldmarkets. As a country with the potential to become amajor world exporter of oil and gas  Kazakhstanattaches great importance to the determination of thelegal status of the Caspian Sea and to the signing of aconvention on that issue. An agreement by the littoralStates on the use of the Caspian Sea exclusively forpeaceful purposes has become an importantaccomplishment in the negotiation process. Kazakhstanholds the view that it is necessary to continue intensiveefforts in a five-party format  gradually overcomingexisting differences in the search for solutions thatwould agree with the fundamental principles ofinternational law and promote the final determinationof the legal status of the Caspian Sea.Kazakhstan is gravely concerned by the fate ofanother sea — the Aral Sea. The continued degradationof the environment of the region seriously affects thehealth and livelihood of the population. The situationin the Aral Sea region has acquired global dimensions;the salt from its seabed has long been present in the airin Europe and Asia  and even over the North Pole. Yetthe international community  unfortunately  is not fullyaware of the grave ramifications of this environmentaldisaster. Technical assistance and financial aid to thepopulation of that long-suffering region have beensporadic. We believe that a special General Assemblyresolution on the Aral Sea has long been overdue.We also urge the international community toreactivate fruitful cooperation in the solution of socialand economic problems facing the population aroundthe former Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground. Thepeople of the region were the unwitting victims ofsome 500 nuclear-weapons tests conducted in the heatof the global arms race. We are grateful to theGovernments of Japan  the United States and otherdonor States for the due attention being paid by themto this screaming problem  yet we believe that  in thisparticular case  multilateral cooperation would havebeen more effective. The framework for suchcooperation is already in place in the form of a relevantGeneral Assembly resolution  whose potential has notbeen used to the full.In conclusion  I would like to emphasize thatKazakhstan will continue to exert every effort tostrengthen global and regional stability  fight terrorismand meet other challenges that we face today."
"89",3705,"KEN",59,2004,"I am honoured toaddress the General Assembly for the first time. Onbehalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  Iconvey to you  Mr. President  and to other members ofthe Bureau our warm congratulations on your electionto steer the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.I am confident that  with your experience andprofessionalism  you will lead us to the fruitfulconclusion of this session. I would also like to paytribute to His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte for hisoutstanding performance as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session.Kenya is convinced that a vibrant  responsive andrepresentative United Nations system is the desire ofall Member States. My delegation welcomes theongoing efforts to reorganize and revitalize the UnitedNations to make it more effective and efficient. Therevitalization exercise must reaffirm the status of theGeneral Assembly as the pre-eminent policy-makingorgan of the United Nations  as envisaged in the UnitedNations Charter. With respect to the Security Council it should be enlarged  democratized and made morerepresentative to reflect the Organization’s membershipin the twenty-first century. We look forward to thefindings of the High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change  appointed by the Secretary-General during last year’s session of the GeneralAssembly.I pay tribute to the Secretary-General  HisExcellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for his commitment andhis efforts to ensure the capacity of United Nationsoffices  in particular the United Nations Office atNairobi  the only United Nations headquarters in adeveloping country. We are encouraged to note that during the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly  budgetary provisions were made forimproving and modernizing conference facilities at theNairobi Office. Nonetheless  there is still a great dealto be done. We urge the Secretary-General tosignificantly increase the regular budget component offunding the United Nations Office at Nairobi to bring itin line with the administrative and financialarrangements of similar United Nations Offices atGeneva and Vienna.The production  stockpiling  transfer and use ofanti-personnel mines are problems of majorproportions that have caused untold suffering topopulations throughout the world  with Africa the mostmine-affected continent. Kenya has been given thehonour to host the First Review Conference of theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines andon Their Destruction — the Ottawa Convention.The Conference — also known as the 2004Nairobi Summit on a Mine-free World — will be heldfrom 29 November to 3 December 2004. Among theevents scheduled will be the pre-Conferenceceremonies on 28 November  presided over by thePresident of the Republic of Kenya  the HonourableMwai Kibaki  who has extended invitations to worldleaders to attend the Conference. I take thisopportunity to invite each and every one of thosepresent here to participate at the highest possible levelat the Conference. I also encourage them to takeadvantage of their presence in Nairobi to sampleKenya’s hospitality and particularly its world-famoussafaris  as well as the sandy beaches along Kenya’scoast.27International peace  security and stability areprerequisites for sustainable development. Kenyarecognized early that peace and stability should be thecornerstone of both its national and foreign policies.Consequently  Kenya has taken an active part in thesearch for peaceful solutions to conflicts in oursubregion  in Africa and in the rest of the world.Within the framework of the IntergovernmentalAuthority on Development (IGAD)  Kenya is chairingthe southern Sudan peace process and the Somalireconciliation process. I am pleased to report that  inthe Sudan peace process  milestones have beenachieved since the signing of the first protocols in2002. The Nairobi Declaration on the final phase of theSudan peace process was signed on 5 June 2004.Although the process has been long and tedious  afinal peace agreement is within reach for the two-decade-long conflict. I would like to appeal to theinternational community to redouble its support andcommitment in assisting the people of the Sudan toachieve peace through constructive dialogue. It is alsomy hope that events in the Darfur region will notsubsume the positive developments achieved by theNaivasha process. However  post-conflictreconstruction will require considerable resources. Theinternational community must rise to that challenge.As regards the Somali peace process  I ampleased to report encouraging developments in the pastfew weeks that indicate a willingness on the part of thepeople of Somalia to embrace peace after 14 years ofturmoil. In mid-August  275 members of Parliamentwere elected by representatives of the Somali people and the Transitional Federal Parliament of the SomaliRepublic was inaugurated on 29 August in Nairobi.Subsequently  the Parliament elected its Speaker on 15September 2004. It is expected that the President willbe elected next month. The process has been long andcostly  but  as a result of our determination andoptimism  we hope to witness the installation of aFederal Government of Somalia by the end of this year.The presence of a Government in Mogadishu  however should be not an end in itself  but the beginning of along journey towards peace  stability and development.I appeal to the international community  andespecially the United Nations  to move with speed andto provide the support necessary for capacity-building infrastructure and security and other logistical supportfor the new Government. I would like to expressKenya’s gratitude for the assistance provided by IGADPartners Forum  the United Nations and theinternational community as a whole in support of bothpeace processes.Long-standing conflicts in our subregion have ledto the proliferation of small arms and light weapons which constitute major security concerns to my countryand others. For example  Kenya has been at theforefront of regional initiatives to combat this menace.In March 2000  Kenya hosted the First MinisterialReview Conference of the Nairobi Declaration on theProblem of the Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms andLight Weapons in the Great Lakes Region and the Hornof Africa  which produced the Declaration. In Aprilthis year  Kenya hosted the Second Ministerial ReviewConference of the Nairobi Declaration  which adoptedthe Nairobi Protocol for the Prevention  Control andReduction of Small Arms and Light Weapons. Thoseefforts are intended to consolidate a regionalframework within which to deal with the problem ofproliferation in order to improve security so that thepeople of the region can redirect their energies andresources towards meaningful economic activities.Kenya therefore welcomes and fully supports theconvening of the international conference for the GreatLakes region on conflict and development  scheduledfor 17-20 November 2004 in Dar es Salaam  Tanzania.My delegation applauds the United Nations and theAfrican Union for mobilizing support and resources forthe preparation of the conference.The threat of international terrorism remains real.We unreservedly condemn all acts of internationalterrorism. On behalf of my delegation and the Kenyanpeople  I extend our sympathy to the Government andpeople of Russia on the recent barbaric terrorist attackon innocent school children  parents and teachers inBeslan. Kenya has been a victim of terrorist attacks inthe recent past. We are therefore more convinced thanever of the need to address this issue collectively. Nosingle country  however resourceful  has the capacity tosuccessfully deal with it on its own. I would like toassure the Assembly that Kenya fully supportsinternational efforts in dealing with this problem.Collective efforts to address the issue must be throughinternational cooperation  information and intelligencesharing  coordinated by the United Nations.In line with the international efforts to ensure thatpeace and security prevail  we welcome the decision bythe African Union to establish a standby African force.28Kenya has been honoured to host one of the regionalcentres  the Eastern Africa Brigade. We are ready toprovide the requisite facilities and logistical support tothe centre. On the international arena  Kenya has longbeen a major troop-contributing country inpeacekeeping operations and will continue to activelyparticipate with other nations under the aegis of theUnited Nations. We call upon the internationalcommunity to assist the African Union in realizing theestablishment of the force  which will be one of the keytools for ensuring peace and stability on the continent.Poverty remains a major impediment tosustainable development  particularly for developingcountries. Current trends indicate that countries in sub-Saharan Africa will not meet the MillenniumDevelopment Goals by the year 2015. We emphasizethe importance of the fulfilment of the eighthMillennium Development Goal on a global partnershipfor development  and especially the realization of thetarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product asofficial development assistance from developedcountries. We therefore look forward to the outcome ofthe 2005 high-level plenary of the General Assemblyon the review of the implementation of the outcomes ofthe major United Nations conferences and summits inthe economic  social and related fields  including theMillennium Declaration.The attainment of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals will depend on how effectively we deal with theHIV/AIDS pandemic and other related communicablediseases  among other problems. In sub-SaharanAfrica  it has resulted in a reversal of economic andsocial gains made over the years. Governments need todevelop strategic plans that identify key priorityresponse areas  such as prevention and advocacy treatment  care and support. Also important are themitigation of the socio-economic impact and research.We are grateful to our development partners and theUnited Nations Global Fund for their support andprovision of resources in fighting these diseases. Welook forward to their continued assistance.At the regional level  tremendous progress hasbeen made towards regional economic integration. TheEast African Community Customs Union Protocol which was signed on 2 March 2004 by Kenya  Ugandaand Tanzania  is intended to create a single investmentand trade area. We hope that this positive developmentwill encourage local and foreign direct investment inthe subregion.We welcome the support accorded to the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)initiative by the United Nations and the G-8 countries.However  we regret to note that the commitments madeto the NEPAD initiative have not been fully realizedand call upon our development partners to fulfil theirpledges.This year  Kenya is facing a severe famine causedby drought  which has affected a large section of thepopulation. Consequently  Kenya and the UnitedNations have issued a joint appeal for assistance tocontain the famine. We are grateful for the promptsupport of the World Food Programme  the UnitedNations Children’s Fund  the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations  the United NationsOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairsand bilateral donors. However  the need for moreassistance still exists.To achieve long-term economic stability anddevelopment  the Government of Kenya has embarkedon an economic recovery strategy for wealth andemployment creation  aimed at revitalizing theeconomy and enhancing the welfare of our people.Other measures have been taken to improve the well-being of the Kenyan people. Those include theimprovement and promotion of the welfare of childrenthrough free and compulsory primary education and therecognition of the central role played by women indevelopment.In conclusion  I would like to emphasize theimportant role the United Nations plays in globalaffairs. It could be greatly enhanced through adherenceto the provisions of the Charter and to the rule of law.Member States should respect those instruments in theconduct of their international relations."
"90",3729,"KGZ",59,2004,"Mr. President  allow me first of all to congratulate youmost warmly on your election to the important post ofPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession and to wish you success in your very complextask. I also wish to express our gratitude to yourpredecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte.In our troubled times  humankind is placing itsmost cherished hopes on the United Nations. Here atthe rostrum of this Organization  I would like toexpress our deep satisfaction with the resolve withwhich the present session of the Assembly hasembarked on a policy that is a quest for effectivesolutions to the key problems now facing theinternational community.After 11 September  the highest priorityunquestionably has been given to fighting internationalterrorism  which has now acquired the nature of adirect war. This is an evil challenge to humankind. Wesincerely grieve for the innocent victims of terroristacts  wherever they may occur. Any victim evokessympathy  but the massacre of children in Beslan ishideously evil. The time has come for terrorists to becalled to account for their criminal acts.The “terrorist international” must be faced with aunited anti-terrorist front on all continents  regions andcountries. It is therein that I see the key to victory.The tone was set for this session by the statementmade by Secretary-General Kofi Annan. With hiscustomary perspicacity  he emphasized that the highestvalue is that of the supremacy of law in domestic andforeign affairs. Genuine interest in organizingcollective action to address new challenges and threatswas a leitmotif of the statements made from thisrostrum by United States President George Bush  theheads of several States  the Minister for ForeignAffairs of Russia  Sergei Lavrov  and other high-ranking representatives. Those statements wereevidence of the growing confidence in ourOrganization and  I believe  represent a long-awaitedrebuff to those who wish us ill and to sow doubtsregarding the United Nations ability to resolve today’spressing problems.A special feature of our forum today is the factthat  along with other extremely important objectives it must serve as a preparatory stage for the sixtieth2anniversary session of the General Assembly. Theinternational community has the right to expect thatnext year’s session will prove to be an historic eventand establish new landmarks for United Nationsactivity. Recalling the ideals endorsed by the foundersof the United Nations  and on the basis ofcontemporary requirements  I would propose that theanniversary session be called a summit of peace andeconomic and social progress.Turning now to the United Nations role in the lifeof my country  I should like to convey to theOrganization and its specialized agencies our sinceregratitude for their support of our national efforts in allareas of State-building. My people will forever recallthe decision taken at the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly in support of the 2 200thanniversary of Kyrgyz statehood.One axiom of Kyrgyz foreign policy is that smallcountries must have big friends. For us  the UnitedNations has always been such a tried and trustedfriend. That is most appropriate for the development ofour Republic on its path to democracy. It is well knownthat the electoral process is considered to be a litmustest for the level of democracy achieved in any givencountry. This year  with direct assistance fromSecretary-General Kofi Annan  the implementation of aUnited Nations project in Kyrgyzstan has initiatedimprovements to the national electoral system with aview to ensuring that it meets international standards.That is particularly important given the electioncampaign now beginning to organs of power at everylevel in the Republic. In that context  United StatesPresident George Bush’s proposal that a fund fordemocracy be established within the United Nations isindeed a good one. Such a fund would substantiallyenhance the United Nations potential in that area.I should now like to turn to another problem. Twoyears ago  under United Nations auspices  the GlobalMountain Summit was convened in our capital Bishkek. In that context  too  we are most grateful forthe Secretary-General’s assistance. The Bishkek GlobalMountain Platform was drafted at the Summit  definingkey objectives for the sustainable development ofmountain countries. That important document wassubmitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession.At this session  I wish also to draw theinternational community’s attention to the needs of theleast developed mountain countries. The time has cometo propose  on behalf of interested countries  theadoption at this session of a special resolutionrecommending forgiveness of the foreign debt of theleast developed mountain countries. That would serveas a powerful stimulus to their comprehensivedevelopment and to overcoming poverty and wouldfully jibe with the objectives proclaimed in theMillennium Declaration. A draft resolution on thatsubject will be submitted to the General Assembly bythe delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic and otherdelegations.In considering future prospects  I believe that theinterests of all groups of countries are most fullyreflected in the decisions of the Millennium Summit. Iam gratified that a thorough and scrupulous analysis ofthe results of five years of implementation of theMillennium Declaration is being planned as a majorelement on the agenda of the sixtieth anniversarysession of the General Assembly. I consider the war onpoverty to be of great importance in that context. Thelink between poverty and international terrorism isindisputable. Those phenomena are organicallyintertwined. Unless we can overcome poverty and themass despair and sense of hopelessness it entails  inparticular among young people  our hopes foruprooting international terrorism may indeed provefutile.In seeking to eradicate poverty  Kyrgyzstan isrelying above all on its own potential. We are mostgrateful in that respect for the assistance of the UnitedNations and the international community  expressed inter alia  in the Monterrey Consensus. In thatconnection  we are hoping for increased assistancethrough the United States Millennium ChallengeAccount. In general  assistance for the development ofpoor countries could be considerably enhanced. Ibelieve that this problem will also be duly reflected inthe work of the present and anniversary sessions of theGeneral Assembly.Earlier  I linked the eradication of poverty and thefight against international terrorism. Within the rangeof interlinked measures  however  a policy to eradicateinternational terrorism through the vigorous applicationof collective force is of unique significance. Within theframework of the anti-terrorist Coalition now activeunder United States auspices  Kyrgyzstan is making animportant contribution to suppressing the ever-activehotbed of terrorism in Afghanistan. I am convinced3that the October elections in that country will be a veryimportant factor in its democratic reorganization andhave a positive impact on the situation in the region asa whole.In order to enhance its contribution to theinternational community’s war on internationalterrorism  Kyrgyzstan has allowed the deployment onits territory — within limited parameters  I wouldemphasize — of armed Russian and United Statescontingents. We are convinced that  in so doing  we arestrengthening the interaction of those great Powers intoday’s war on a common enemy. Our Kyrgyz land willcontinue to be a place for the great Powers to cooperateand to pool their efforts  rather than to compete.We support international action to eradicate theterrorist threat in Iraq. That has become the principalobstacle to the development of democracy and toensuring peace in that country. We know from our ownexperience that this is a long and thorny path  but onethat Iraq will have to take. The foundation for theinternational community’s actions must be theprinciple that  in assisting Afghanistan and Iraq incombating terrorism  establishing peace and buildingdemocracy  we are assisting ourselves.I believe that there is a need here to unmask anyattempt to provide scholarly justification of any sortfor international terrorism. I am referring here inparticular to the concept of the clash of civilizations which cannot be thought of as an innocent theoreticalexercise.In that light  this summer  along the shores of our“blue pearl”  Lake Issyk-Kul  Kyrgyzstan and theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization organized a conference entitled “Eurasiain the twenty-first century: Dialogue of cultures or aconflict of civilizations?” The idea of a conflict ofcivilizations was firmly condemned at the conference.For my part  I believe that the term “conflict ofcivilizations” should be erased from the global politicallexicon as unfounded theoretically and harmful inpractice. I note with satisfaction that  in his statementat this session  President Bush rejected the concept of aconflict of civilizations. The future belongs to thedialogue of cultures and civilizations.In conclusion  I wish to address the issue ofUnited Nations reform. Kyrgyzstan supports proposalsaimed at bringing the Organization ever more closelyin line with the realities of the twenty-first century particularly with respect to the role of the SecurityCouncil. In that regard  I believe that the UnitedNations at its anniversary session can and must decideto include Germany and Japan among the permanentmembers of the Council. We also support theexpansion of the permanent and non-permanentcategories of Council membership on the basis of theprinciple of equal geographic distribution.The enhancement of the United Nationspeacekeeping potential is another positive concept.Kyrgyzstan will continue to respond positively torequests for its personnel in efforts to attain thosegoals.Lastly  Kyrgyzstan and other countries of CentralAsia  in cooperation with Russia and China  intend tocontinue to support the international community’sefforts to counter international terrorism and to meetother global challenges and threats through activeregional measures. Evidence of our resolve is thegrowing role of the Shanghai CooperationOrganization  the Commonwealth of IndependentStates and the Collective Security Organization.From this high rostrum  I reaffirm thatKyrgyzstan  in a spirit of unwavering dedication to theprinciples and purposes of the United Nations  willcontinue to be a reliable link in the internationalcommunity’s efforts to ensure peace  security andprosperity for all peoples of this planet."
"91",3772,"KHM",59,2004," At the outset  I wish to joinother Member States in congratulating you Mr. President  on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Given yourextensive experience and wisdom  I am confident thatyou will successfully steer the course of this session which is important for the challenging world that welive in today.I commend the efforts and the contribution to theUnited Nations of Mr. Julian Hunte as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session  and Iexpress my appreciation to Secretary-General KofiAnnan for his commitment  dedication and leadershipin working to further the realization of the objectivesand the mission of the United Nations in ourincreasingly complex world.Since 11 September 2001  the response toterrorism at the global  regional and national levels hasbeen significant and massive. Nevertheless  despite theprogress we have made in our efforts  countriesthroughout the world continue to suffer from terroristattacks that continue to kill innocent people. Therefore I believe that our response to this deadly threat tohumanity must be more comprehensive. However  Ialso believe that  while we fight terrorism relentlessly we should do our best to understand its true rootcauses. When we are able to do that  we can hope toeliminate terrorism.When the Millennium Development Goals werelaunched in 2000  they held much hope for developingcountries  but so far there have been no meaningfulresults. Poverty on many parts of the globe remainsone of the greatest challenges in the world today  withmore than 1.2 billion people surviving on less than $1per day. Global poverty reduction is not theresponsibility of developing countries alone; it is alsothe shared responsibility of the internationalcommunity  particularly the developed countries.Perhaps it is time for more concrete actions rather thanmere declarations.With regard to the Middle East conflict  I believethat the international community should continue tosupport the inalienable and sacred right of thePalestinian people to an independent State. We shouldalso urge all parties involved to put an end to theviolence once and for all. All the parties must put aside4their hatred and their historical animosity. Both thePalestinians and the Israelis must realize that they haveequal rights to coexist  living side by side in peace andharmony for the sake of their own peoples and peace inthe region.Concerning the situation in Iraq  I believe that thecurrent  unending violence there has not created anenvironment conducive to national reconciliation andpeace. It is my view that the United Nations and theinternational community must do everything possibleto restore peace  security and political stability to Iraqso that the Iraqi people will have a chance to choose  ina sovereign manner  their own leaders and their ownGovernment. I believe that democracy can never beexported or imported; it is a state of mind and must belearned.With regard to the Taiwan issue  Cambodia is ofthe view that it is a vital issue not only for China  butalso for the region as a whole. Cambodia  like othermembers of the community of nations  has beenunequivocally supportive of a genuine “one-China”policy  since we recognize the fact that Taiwan is anintegral part of China.Every year in the General Assembly  mostmembers of this global institution have called forreform of the United Nations  particularly of theSecurity Council. Indeed  Cambodia is of the view thatreform of the Council is essential  not only for thecredibility of the Council itself  but for that of theentire United Nations system as well. The reform ofthe Security Council will undoubtedly reflect therealities of the world today. In reforming the Councilby enlarging its membership  we will make it morerepresentative  more democratic and more efficient. Inthat regard  Cambodia supports the candidacies ofJapan  Germany and India for permanent seats on theCouncil. The number of non-permanent membersrepresenting various parts of the world should also beincreased.Cambodia wishes to appeal to all Member Statesto support its candidacy for a non-permanent seat onthe Security Council for the period 2006-2007. Sincewe joined the United Nations in 1955  Cambodia hasnever held any position within it  although we havealways cooperated closely with the Organization.With the formation of our new Government inJuly this year  and with the adoption of our rectangularstrategy and our political programme  the RoyalGovernment of Cambodia has accorded top priority tobuilding good governance in order to carry out keyareas of reform and the four pillars of its rectangularstrategy for socio-economic development.In conclusion  I believe that we need to ensurethat the Millennium Development Goals are followedup and carried out in response to the hopes of thebillions of poor people who live in developingcountries. Moreover  I feel that poverty reductionshould remain a top priority to be addressedcollectively by the international community so that wecan close the gap between the haves and the have-nots.In the light of the challenges that pose greater threatsto our world today than ever before — terrorism violence  conflict  poverty  epidemics of infectiousdiseases  environmental degradation and manyothers — I firmly believe that we need a stronger andmore efficient United Nations to address thosechallenges in the most effective way possible. In thatregard  the Organization must be truly representative fully democratic and strongly committed to the causeof humanity."
"92",3786,"KIR",59,2004,"It is with great pleasure that Ibring warm greetings from the Government and peopleof Kiribati on whose behalf I have the honour toaddress the Assembly today.Before I begin  I would like to extend ourcongratulations to Mr. Jean Ping on his election to thepresidency of the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. We have every confidence in his ableleadership to guide the work of the Assembly and todeliver conclusive outcomes. He has our full supportand cooperation in carrying out his work. I wish also tothank the President’s predecessor for the excellentwork he has done in steering the work of the Assemblyduring the past year. My congratulations also go to theSecretary-General for his sterling leadership of ourOrganization during these trying times and for risingcommendably to the challenge.We gather again this year amidst the reality ofdaunting challenges that continue to confront us asindividual nations and as a global community. Theongoing conflicts in Iraq and other parts of the world the scourge of terrorism and the existence of nucleararsenals  accelerated environmental degradation andthe threat of global warming and sea-level rise  hungerand poverty  the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other non-communicable diseases  the marginalization of theleast developed countries within the global economyand underdevelopment  all continue to pose majorchallenges that our Organization must address today.Those challenges cast a dark shadow over thecommitments made by world leaders at the MillenniumSummit held here in New York four years ago pledging to work collectively to maintain peace andsecurity  to eliminate poverty and to promotedevelopment for the benefit of all mankind in the newmillennium.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionand the illicit trade in small arms and light weaponscontinue to threaten international security. We must beunified in our approach and address those challengeseffectively by strengthening multilateral disarmamentand non-proliferation treaties and agreements andthrough closer regional and international cooperation.Kiribati supports all non-proliferation efforts and inthat respect is party to  among others  the Treaty on the2Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and theChemical Weapons Convention.We commend and support the work of theinternational community and efforts taken at thenational  regional and international levels to respond tothe challenges of terrorism  recognizing the need forinternational solidarity in addressing that increasingglobal threat.Kiribati is committed to the global fight againstterrorism. Terrorism knows no boundaries and wecannot claim immunity from it. Indeed  as a smallisland developing State we have very little capacity todevelop any effective countermeasures and aretherefore especially vulnerable to terrorism.We acknowledge the importance of complyingwith United Nations resolutions and internationalsecurity arrangements that have been adopted in thefight against terrorism. While we cannot afford to becomplacent in our efforts in that regard  it must berecognized that the requirements for compliance withthose resolutions and arrangements do pose enormouschallenges for countries such as Kiribati. Our limitedresources and technical capacity are already committedto providing for the basic and essential social andeconomic needs of our rapidly growing population thus placing severe constraints on our ability to makeprogress in compliance. I would like to note  however that  with technical assistance from our developmentpartners  we have made progress in enacting importantlegislation relating to terrorism and transnationalcrime. We expect to make further progress oncompliance with the counter-terrorism requirementsshortly.The progress made so far has revolved primarilyaround the introduction of legislation. We recognizethat this is just the beginning of the process. Theimplementation and enforcement of the legislationenacted will pose an immense challenge. In thisrespect  we will continue to count on the assistance andsupport of the international community.We note with deep regret and concern the loss oflife and devastation to property caused by the recentseries of hurricanes affecting the Caribbean and theAtlantic coast of the United States. We offer our deepsympathy to those affected by those natural disasters.The adverse impact of climate change and sea-level rise is  indeed  a critical security issue for theglobal community in this new millennium  especiallyfor low-lying island States like Kiribati. That issuemust take centre stage with other international securityissues. We urge the international community to agreeon a unified global response in order to better protectthe environment  in the same way that the internationalcommunity is being encouraged to respond to terrorismand other threats to global security. Our inability as aglobal community to agree on a unified stand onclimate change and sea-level rise is very disappointingindeed  and we deplore the notion that economicgrowth must take precedence over environmentalissues at any cost. Our very existence as a State —indeed  the existence all States similar to Kiribati — isat stake if such thinking continues to prevail.I would like at this juncture to express ourgratitude to the many countries that have ratified theKyoto Protocol and to appeal to those that have not todo so as a matter of urgency. We have demonstratedremarkable solidarity in the fight against globalterrorism. Can we not demonstrate the same solidarityin the fight against climate change and sea-level rise?Regional cooperation has been a very effectivemechanism in addressing the many challenges faced bycountries in our region. Regional cooperation hasenabled many Pacific countries to meet some of thecounter-terrorism requirements. Regional cooperationhas also enabled us to effectively address emergingissues confronting our region; the outstanding successof the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islandsis a clear demonstration of that.We in the Pacific are confident of our ability tosteer a course for the future. We have approved work tocommence on a Pacific plan that will promotecollective action in the areas of security  goodgovernance  economic growth and sustainabledevelopment. We envisage that the Pacific plan willresult in the delivery of tangible benefits to ourrespective peoples and communities.We recognize the need for  and welcome strengthened cooperation and the development ofcloser linkages and partnerships between the UnitedNations and its specialized agencies and otherorganizations  including the Pacific Islands Forum.Such linkages and partnerships can only result in themore effective  coordinated and harmonized delivery ofassistance to member countries.Making progress with regard to the developmentaspirations of our peoples is a high — if not thehighest — priority for many of us who are here today.Our national policy objective is to achieve the3equitable distribution of development benefits to allour peoples  based on the principles of goodgovernance. We are committed to the MillenniumDeclaration and are on track in our national efforts toachieve the Millennium Development Goals.The Goals have been integrated andmainstreamed into our national development strategy.We are committed to pursuing those goals as the basisof sustainable development. In this connection  I wouldlike to express our appreciation to all our developmentpartners  who  over the years  have contributedmeaningfully to the realization of our developmentaspirations.While we are grateful for the assistance extendedby our development partners  there is scope for us toachieve more for our peoples — and to do so withoutdevelopment assistance. Kiribati has a large exclusiveeconomic zone that has an abundant fisheries resource.Those resources are presently being harvested byvessels from distant-water fishing nations under licensearrangements. However  the return from these licensingarrangements is negligible  at only around 5 per cent ofthe landed value of the catch.Naturally  we would like to see greater returnsfrom that resource. Our ability to achieve sustainableeconomic development depends on it. Accordingly  weurge the flag States of those fishing interests toencourage their industries to explore the mutualbenefits to be gained from collaboration with resourceowners in establishing on-shore facilities that will addvalue to the commodity. We believe that such a modelwill also result in easing the pressure on fish stocksand ensure conservation of the resource for thesustainable benefit of mankind.The entry into force in June this year of theWestern and Central Pacific Tuna Conventionrepresents a major development in the management ofthe western and central Pacific tuna fishery.In this age of rapid globalization  advances ininformation technology and trade liberalization  it isregrettable that  while some are reaping the fullbenefits of those advances and developments significantly more remain on the fringes. The reality isthat a large proportion of the world’s population  mostof whom live in developing countries  continue to livein poverty and are marginalized in tradingarrangements and market access opportunities. Thepromise of globalization and open trading as a positiveforce for economic growth  and social progresscontinues to elude the many. Much work needs to bedone to ensure that the many also enjoy the benefits ofglobalization.Kiribati supports the findings of the report of theWorld Commission on the Social Dimension ofGlobalization. We urge that the findings of the reportbe taken into consideration and incorporated into thework of the Assembly  especially for the 2005 high-level review of the outcome of the MillenniumSummit.We welcome the United Nations support for theconvening  early next year in Mauritius  of theInternational Meeting for the 10-Year Review of theBarbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. Likeother small island developing States  we attach greatimportance to that review. With the continued supportand commitment of our development partners to theprocess  we can be assured of important outcomes thatwill go a long way in making a real difference to thequality of life for our peoples.We share the concerns of the internationalcommunity about the spread of HIV/AIDS and itsdevastating impact as both a health crisis and adevelopment concern. We welcome the recentdevelopments in the search for affordable drugs forHIV/AIDS victims in developing countries. Weencourage greater collaboration on HIV/AIDS researchand the mobilization of resources for preventionactivities and for better medical care for affectedpatients.We believe in the continuing relevance andimportance of the role of the United Nations and itsability to respond to the challenges of ourcontemporary world. In this regard  Kiribati welcomesand fully supports the efforts to reform thisOrganization to enable it to better respond to thechallenges of this era.Given the crucial role of the Security Council inthe promotion of international peace and security andthe importance we attach to that issue  we see thenecessity for Security Council reform  including theexpansion of both the permanent and non-permanentmembership of the Council. Expansion is required tobetter reflect the realities of our world today. We notethat some countries  including Japan  have consistentlycommitted substantial resources towards themaintenance of global peace and security  and webelieve that they should be accorded permanentmembership on the Security Council.4We attach great importance to our membership inthis noble Organization  and we reaffirm ourcommitment to upholding the noble values andprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations. The Charter epitomizes our hope forachieving justice and equality and the safeguarding andpromotion of fundamental human rights of all peoples.Within that context  we believe that the exclusionaryprinciples applied to Taiwan in its bid for UnitedNations membership go against the very values andobjectives of the Charter that we all strive to uphold. Inthis era of tension and conflict we should discard thepresent exclusionary practices and adopt a moreembracing environment where all countries willing andable to contribute to the international community’sefforts to promote world peace and stability arewelcomed as equal partners. Taiwan has made andcontinues to make notable contributions to thedevelopment of many developing countries and has thecapacity to contribute constructively to the good workof the United Nations. It is therefore regrettable thatthe desire of the 23 million people of Taiwan to againbecome a part of that global community of nationscontinues to be rejected.The challenges that confront us at this point intime are indeed daunting  but they are notinsurmountable. With renewed commitments and witha common resolve to work in close cooperation and insupport of each other  we can succeed in creating amore secure  a more prosperous and a more just worldfor all in this millennium."
"93",3817,"KNA",59,2004,"I am pleasedto welcome and congratulate you  Sir  and the Republicof Gabon through you  for allowing us to share yourexperience and expertise on the occasion of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I must conveyto Mr. Julian Hunte  Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia my country’s gratitude for his hard work andmemorable contribution to this Organization over thepast year.The Government of Saint Kitts and Nevisreaffirms its strong support for and commitment to thepraiseworthy  attainable Millennium DevelopmentGoals. Their stated objectives are fundamental andhave long been incorporated into my country’s nationalhuman development agenda.For decades  before the Millennium DevelopmentGoals were agreed upon  Saint Kitts and Nevis hadinstituted compulsory primary and secondaryeducation  which may explain our achievement of aliteracy rate of 97.8 per cent. We in the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) are very proud of ourachievements in the field of education. We owe muchof that success to our coherent system of education andalso to the University of the West Indies  whoseacademic credentials continue to amaze and evolve tomeet the needs of our people. We invite fellow UnitedNations Member States to explore that resource in theCaribbean so their citizens can pursue higher educationin that great institution of learning and in the mostpeaceful and pristine of multicultural settings.It is easy to become excited when I speak of ourefforts in addressing the issue of women indevelopment  but we will not let down our guard. InSaint Kitts and Nevis  we have recognized andbenefited from gender equality and the empowermentof women. It may be recalled that Saint Kitts and Neviswas among the first in this hemisphere to create aMinistry Of Women’s Affairs.Equally important to the Government of SaintKitts and Nevis is winning the war against poverty. Weremain steadfast in our efforts to eliminate poverty which is not simply a noble ideal. It is a practical achievable objective and  by God  it is the right thingto do. In Saint Kitts and Nevis  in the last seven years we have endured social and economic dislocations inthe wake of several catastrophic natural disasters  9/11and the downturns in the global economy. Nonetheless with due care and attention to prudent fiscal andmonetary management  we are investing in the socio-economic development of our country and continue toplace people first in all that we do.My Government has invested greatly in ournational health system  supported by the constructionof a modern hospital and the professional developmentof health care workers. We believe that this willimprove the quality of and access to health care fornationals and visitors alike. Our continued efforts tobuild a healthy nation are consistent with our resolve toreduce child mortality and improve maternal health.Our capital project investments have improvedthe existing distribution networks to satisfy demandand to better extend service coverage for potable waterthroughout the islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Ourroad improvement and maintenance programmes haveresurfaced miles of road and improved drainagethroughout the twin island Federation. Theimprovement of the tourism product has generatedseveral new jobs consistent with my Government’speople-focused agenda. It has allowed us to depend14less on an agriculture-based economy  which continuesto suffer from Government subsidies offered to farmersin large countries. Such subsidies make it moredifficult for small economies like mine to compete.Our capacity to compete is further undermined by therecent unilateral decision of the European Union toreduce the price of sugar by more than 30 per cent.Despite these challenges  we continue to press on mindful of the need to preserve the environment. SaintKitts and Nevis are two beautiful islands faced with thegeographic reality of being located in the hurricanecorridor. We witness the cost of beach and coastalerosion resulting from rising sea levels and hurricanes.Integrating environmentally sustainable policies intoour development agenda has been a real challenge.However  our determination to protect and preserve theislands’ patrimony by adopting environmentallyfriendly programmes is imperative.At this juncture  I need to emphasize the currentsituation facing small island developing States. Allsmall island developing States lack the economy ofscale to overcome their vulnerabilities on their own.We are extremely vulnerable unless we formgeographical partnerships  as CARICOM has done.That  however  does not exempt us from thevulnerabilities that we face every day. Geographicalpartnership does allow for a quick response in theevent of adversity.My delegation urges the international communityto accept the concept of vulnerability  leading to avulnerability index that can be appropriately applied tosmall island developing States. Grenada’s devastationwithin three hours of being struck by hurricane Ivandramatizes for us how a generation of developmentprogress can be wiped out in a small vulnerable nation.There is a pressing need for a global development fundto assist small island developing States in recoveryfollowing national disasters.Pragmatic and productive partnerships are themost effective vehicle available to the internationalcommunity to tackle the multitude of problems weface. We speak of important issues  such as democracy globalization  terrorism  poverty eradication  humandevelopment and the spread of infectious disease  as ifthey were completely disconnected. The goal of humandevelopment on any scale is best achieved byrecognizing the interconnectedness of our lives  oureconomies and our policies. That imposes an obligationto develop common strategies  partnerships and policyapproaches that accept and address the intrinsiclinkages among the problems facing nation States.I submit that the Pan-Caribbean PartnershipAgainst HIV/AIDS is the first and only regionalmechanism created to deal with the pandemic in amultinational way. Our regional cooperation has led toreductions in the cost of antiretroviral drugs from$20 000 per person per year to $200 per patient peryear. We have also been successful in negotiatingreduced prices for other important pharmaceuticaldrugs. That experience speaks to the value ofpartnership and cooperation. We believe that networksare the most effective means of problem solving. Wepraise the efforts of the Global Fund and the UnitedNations for their work in mobilizing additionalresources to treat people living with HIV/AIDS and tofight the spread of the disease.The idea of fighting HIV/AIDS only throughfaith simplifies the human condition and suggests amisunderstanding of the nature and scope of thedisease. My Government insists that a pragmatic policyapproach to fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS is asfundamental to good governance as is the holding offree and fair elections. Good governance meansGovernments listening to and caring for their citizens.Good governance implies that leaders must lead withmoral courage and take bold and sometimescontroversial steps in the public interests.Good governance means placing the UnitedNations at the centre of our international interaction  inaccordance with and in full respect for the Charter.Good governance requires respect for every country’sright to choose its own course  consistent with its ownlaws and the will of its people. Good governance is notsimply about whether we ostracize a country if itspolicies run counter to our national agenda. It shouldbe about creating better understanding  cooperation andpartnership and building bridges of friendship. Goodgovernance suggests to us in Saint Kitts and Nevis thatGovernments abide by and commit themselves tointernationally recognized standards and principles anddo not discard them when it becomes expedient. Goodgovernance entails holding everyone to the samestandard and not raising the bar for some countries andlowering it for others.Good governance should propel us to recognizethe fact that nearly 23 million people in the Republic of15China on Taiwan are essentially in a diplomatic blackhole  alienated from our international discourse. Goodgovernance requires all peace-loving nations to urgeboth sides of the Taiwan Straits not only to commit to but also to engage in constructive dialogue andpreventive diplomacy. Good governance behooves usto support the hard work of the leaders and people ofthe Republic of China on Taiwan to comply with andwork within the framework of international law. Goodgovernance says to us in Saint Kitts and Nevis that apeople committed to the rule of law and democracy andwilling to invest in human development at home andabroad should never be excluded from the fraternity ofnations.In addition  CARICOM takes great pride in ourparliamentary system of Government and our soliddemocracies from a centuries-old tradition. Our historyteaches us that good governance and humandevelopment are indivisible. Where representativedemocracy  democratic institution-building  freedom ofexpression and the protection of human rights have notflourished  human development has suffered. WhereGovernments have failed to respect the will of thepeople  human development has faltered. AlthoughCARICOM faces great limitations and challengesowing to the absence of natural and financial resources we have managed to build credible democraticinstitutions  a reliable judicial system and lastingdemocracies in which the transition from incumbentGovernments to opposition parties passes withoutincident. We are ready to share these experiences withthe rest of the world.In conclusion  for decades countries andacademics have questioned the viability of smallStates. History  though  has witnessed not only ourviability  but also that we are a dependable beacon ofhope for others  be they large or small. We live in aninterconnected world where national political decisionsin one corner of the world have devastatingconsequences thousands of miles away.We must therefore of necessity become ourbrothers’ keepers. In that vein  we call on MemberStates to lend their support to the international meetingto review the Barbados Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  scheduled to be held in Mauritius in January2005.Finally  I would like to repeat my call thatpartnership must trump nationalism and thatmultilateralism must transcend unilateralism."
"94",3843,"KOR",59,2004,"I would like firstof all to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. JeanPing on his assumption of the presidency of GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. I have everyconfidence that he will meet with distinction thechallenges of his eminent office. I would also like totake this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor Mr. Julian Robert Hunte  as well as to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.The past year has been marked by a series ofatrocious terrorist attacks. The stark reality is that nopeople or nation is safe from the spectre ofinternational terrorism. Through their cowardly acts terrorists seek to generate chaos and fear  rainingviolence upon the innocent — even children  as we so27painfully and clearly witnessed in the recent tragedy inBeslan  Russia. I would like to take this opportunity toextend my sincere sympathy to all those affected byterrorist attacks around the world.The Republic of Korea has been no exception inits exposure to heinous terrorist attacks. In particular we experienced  with deep sorrow and pain  the loss ofa Korean — a victim of such savagery — in Iraq inJune this year. There can be no justification whatsoeverfor such brutality and cruel disregard for human life.That inhuman act has only bolstered our determinationto rid the world of the dark cloud of terrorism. TheRepublic of Korea remains firm in its conviction thatthe international community must never give in to thedemands of terrorists.The fight against terrorism calls for unity in theinternational community  with the United Nations inthe lead  as well as the enhanced ability of eachindividual Member State to combat terrorism.Iraq still remains a very pressing security concernfor the international community. The inauguration ofan interim Government and the transfer of sovereigntyset in motion the process of political transition towardsa new era of democracy for the Iraqi people. TheUnited Nations has a wealth of experience to offer Iraqin the process of its political normalization andnational rehabilitation. The transition cannot proceedsmoothly  however  without the restoration of order. Tothat end  the assistance of the international communityis vital.The Republic of Korea has been activelyparticipating in international efforts to build a peaceful democratic and prosperous Iraq. We strongly believethat stability in Iraq is vital for peace and security inthe Middle East and beyond. In implementation ofSecurity Council resolutions 1511 (2003) and 1546(2004)  we are in the process of dispatching 3 600troops to the multinational forces in Iraq. The aim ofthis is to assist the Iraqi people’s efforts aimed atrehabilitation and reconstruction. We have also pledgedto contribute $260 million to that end  focusing onareas such as health  education  capacity-building  jobcreation and the provision of electricity.Terrorism lends renewed urgency to our commonendeavour to halt the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and their means of delivery. In particular this year’s revelations about a nuclear black-marketnetwork in Asia have alerted the internationalcommunity to the danger of nuclear weapons fallinginto terrorist hands. Faced with this new kind of threatto nuclear non-proliferation  the internationalcommunity must work to close the loopholes in theexisting non-proliferation regime. Against thatbackdrop  my Government strongly supports SecurityCouncil resolution 1540 (2004) on non-proliferation adopted by the Council in April this year.The Republic of Korea has actively participatedin the efforts of the international community in thenon-proliferation field. In February this year  webecame the thirty-ninth country to ratify the AdditionalProtocol to the Safeguards Agreement. In June  wejoined the Group of Eight (G8) Global Partnershipagainst the Spread of Weapons and Materials of MassDestruction in order to support joint efforts to stem thespread of deadly arsenals. We held the chairmanship ofthe Nuclear Suppliers Group for the year 2003-2004 and we will also host the plenary meeting of theMissile Technology Control Regime in Seoul nextmonth. These are just a few facts that attest to myGovernment’s unwavering commitment to the cause ofthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.Given such a solid commitment on our part  myGovernment reported the recent discoveries about pastscientific experiments involving nuclear materials inmy country pursuant to the additional protocol to thesafeguards agreement with the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA). The experiments wereisolated  laboratory-scale research activities that a fewscientists conducted on their own for purelyexperimental purposes. In good faith and with fulltransparency  my Government has been providing fullcooperation to the IAEA in its activities to review andverify our declarations on nuclear research activities.Renewing and reaffirming our commitment tonuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclearenergy  the Government of the Republic of Koreaannounced the following “Four Principles for thePeaceful Use of Nuclear Energy” on 18 September 2004.First  the Republic of Korea reaffirms that it hasno intention of developing or possessing nuclearweapons. Secondly  the Republic of Korea will firmlymaintain nuclear transparency and will strengthen ourcooperation with the international community to thisend. Thirdly  the Republic of Korea will faithfullyabide by the norms set out in agreements on nuclearnon-proliferation  including the Treaty on the Non-28Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the JointDeclaration on the Denuclearization of the KoreanPeninsula. Fourthly  on the basis of international trustand with the highest level of transparency  the Republicof Korea will continue to expand the peaceful use ofnuclear energy.I would now like to turn to one of the mostimportant tasks that lie ahead: resolving the NorthKorean nuclear issue. The Government of the Republicof Korea has been actively engaged in the efforts tobring about a peaceful resolution to this issue throughthe six-party talks process. The Republic of Koreafirmly believes that the expeditious resolution of theNorth Korean nuclear issue is in the best interests of allthe participants in the six-party talks  including theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. The resolutionof this issue will certainly have a positive impact onthe global nuclear non-proliferation regime. It will alsohave a profound effect on the relations between NorthKorea and the other countries participating in the six-party talks.Upon the resolution of the nuclear issue  NorthKorea would indeed be able to become a full-fledgedmember of the international community  enabling it togain all the accompanying benefits. It is our ferventwish that the Democratic People’s Republic of Koreawill make a strategic decision to forgo all its nuclear-weapon programmes  including its uranium enrichmentprogrammes  in a thorough and transparent manner.The Government of the Republic of Korea alsostrongly hopes that the fourth round of talks will beheld as soon as possible  so that we can engage insubstantive discussions on concrete steps toward thedenuclearization of the Korean peninsula.While seeking a peaceful resolution to the NorthKorean nuclear issue  the Korean Government isworking hard to ensure the steady improvement ofinter-Korean relations. Indeed  Government-levelmeetings have been institutionalized and as many as 90such meetings have been held over the past two years.Impressive progress is also being made on majorprojects for economic cooperation. In particular  thestart of operations at the Gaesong industrial complex scheduled for later this year  will be a significantachievement in inter-Korean cooperation.As a result of such efforts  we believe that inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation have now advancedto a point from which there is no turning back. The riseof such inter-Korean interaction and interdependencewill certainly contribute to peace and prosperity on theKorean peninsula and beyond.There are no easy answers to the many problemsthe world now faces  and poverty is at the top of thatlist. The roots of poverty run deep  with no simplesolution in sight. A large part of the human populationstill languishes in abject poverty  presenting a seriousstumbling block to the achievement of our shared goalof lasting peace and prosperity for all.Four years ago  the leaders of the world pledgedto reduce by half the proportion of people living inpoverty and hunger by the year 2015 as part of theMillennium Development Goals. However  at thispoint  the gap between the objectives and the tangibleprogress we have made remains wide. It is our sincerehope that the 2005 high-level meeting to review theprogress made in the implementation of the Goals willserve to renew our commitment to the world’s poor.Political will is the key.Over the past year  the United Nations hascontinued its efforts to realize our common aspirationsfor the promotion of human rights  freedom and well-being. While persevering in its quest to make humanrights universal  the United Nations has exerted specialefforts to enable the most vulnerable of our fellow humanbeings to enjoy the rights and freedoms that should beguaranteed to all. In particular  much progress has beenmade in the endeavours to draft a convention topromote the rights of persons with disabilities.The Government of the Republic of Koreastrongly supports global action to strengthen the valuesof human rights and democracy around the world. Justlast week in Seoul  we organized a seminar on goodgovernance practices for the promotion of humanrights  in conjunction with the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and theUnited Nations Development Programme.Next year in Seoul  my Government will alsohost the Sixth Global Forum on ReinventingGovernment  in cooperation with the United Nations.We are convinced that this Forum will serve as a usefulvenue for the exchange of experience in Governmentinnovations aimed at enhancing participation andtransparency in governance.We also support the United Nations in reachingout to people in distress in many corners of the world29and providing life-saving assistance to millions ofrefugees and others displaced by conflicts and naturaldisasters. We share the concern of the internationalcommunity over the humanitarian crisis unfolding inDarfur  Sudan. Security Council resolution 1564 (2004)should be implemented so as to bring back peace andstability to this troubled area and its inhabitants.Furthermore  all too often  the complexities ofmajor crises have been fuelled by the public healthemergency created by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Inorder to overcome the scourge of HIV/AIDS  it is vitalthat we strengthen the global assistance mechanisms.In this regard  the 3 by 5 Initiative of the World HealthOrganization  aimed at providing antiretroviraltreatment to 3 million infected people by the year2005  is a very timely and proactive initiative.For almost six decades  the United Nations hasplayed a crucial role in merging the diverse interests ofour Member States for the global good. As theinternational community becomes more interdependentand areas of cooperation expand further in the twenty-first century  the world body will have an even greaterrole to play.Meanwhile  doubts have been expressed as towhether the current United Nations system is suitablefor confronting the challenges of the new century. Asthe Secretary-General has pointed out  the UnitedNations has come to a fork in the road. Choices mustbe made if the United Nations is to be strengthened andmade more effective.In that regard  the Republic of Korea hopes that theHigh-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Changeestablished on the recommendation of the Secretary-General will identify the challenges the internationalcommunity faces and recommend ways to deal withthem effectively. We look forward to the Panel’s reportand hope that its recommendations will shed light onways to make the United Nations more effective andresponsive to the needs of the twenty-first century.No doubt  continued reform of the United Nationswill be an important part of our discussions. Inparticular  the Security Council  as the primary organfor maintaining peace and security  must be reformedin such a way as to make it more representative anddemocratic than it is today. In that regard  we share theview that the Security Council should be expanded toadequately reflect the increase in the membership ofthe United Nations during the past decades. Expansionof the Security Council should be designed to enablemore countries to participate in the Council more often and on the basis of a more equitable geographicaldistribution. In that spirit  we support an increase innon-permanent members so as to accord to thoseMember States willing and able to contribute tointernational peace and security greater opportunitiesto serve in the Council.As diverse as they are  there is a common threadthat holds together all the views expressed in thishonourable Hall. We are all united in the goal of seeking abetter and more peaceful world. Now more than ever countries are called to rise to challenges together  asMembers of our one global body. The Republic ofKorea stands firm in its hopes for and belief in theUnited Nations as the steadfast anchor for ourcollective endeavours and remains as committed as everto fully playing its part in all areas of its noble work."
"95",3889,"KWT",59,2004,"I ampleased to convey my congratulations to the Presidentelected to the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. I likewise take this opportunity to expressour appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for the great efforts he has been exerting torestructure and reform the United Nations  to improveits methods of work and revitalize its role in all fieldsin order to face the demands and challenges of thetwenty-first century.Reform and restructuring of the United Nationssystem have become imperatives  since this worldOrganization remains the ideal mechanism to addressthe urgent problems of the world  by way of combatingpoverty and hunger  ensuring the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  achieving disarmamentand resolving armed conflicts  combating diseases thattake the lives of millions  such as AIDS and malaria.The United Nations has organized numerousinternational conferences and summits in the last 10years  such as the Millennium Summit  the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburgand the International Conference on Financing for50Development in Monterrey to address thosemultilateral problems. The international communitymay not have been able to achieve enough progress inaddressing some of these issues  but this should notprevent us from redoubling our efforts to implementthe international treaties  resolutions and programmesof action of such United Nations conferences. Thismust be done in order to ensure respect for thepurposes and principles of the Charter  internationallaw  the central role of the United Nations and itsprimacy in preserving international peace and securityand in the strengthening of international cooperation inthe economic  social and cultural spheres.Terrorism is one of the major challenges theUnited Nations faces in this millennium. Its negativeeffects are extremely serious and touch upon all Stateswithout exception  although to varying degrees.Terrorist attacks such as those of 11 September 2001 the attacks against the brotherly kingdom of SaudiArabia and the events in Jakarta and Beslan emphasizethe fact that this phenomenon affects us all. Its targets areall peoples of the world  not any one State in particular.We must  therefore  cooperate fully andcollectively in addressing the roots of terrorism and notsimply deal with its tragic effects. Kuwait has endorsedall of the United Nations resolutions to combatterrorism. Terrorism  however  is not related to any oneethnic group  culture or religion. It is an internationalphenomenon that must be addressed by the UnitedNations  as the ideal framework for diagnosing itscauses and arriving at the necessary solutions neededto contain it.A year and a half after the fall of SaddamHusseinís dictatorship  the situation in Iraq continuesto be a delicate one of uncertainty and insecurity  dueto terrorist acts carried out by armed groups and theremnants of the old regime. This is hampering theefforts of the interim Iraqi Government  which isendeavouring to rebuild what the old regime destroyedthrough its policy of aggression.Convinced as we are that security and stability inIraq mean security for the region as a whole  Kuwaitsupports the efforts of the Iraqis to rebuild theircountry in these difficult times  so that Iraq mayresume its positive international and regional roles. Weare sure that the Iraqi people will be able to do this. Inthat regard  we support Security Council resolution1546 (2004)  which supports the effort that everyonewishes to see  namely  the preservation of Iraqíssovereignty  territorial integrity and unity. Kuwaitsupports the interim Government of Iraq  which isexpressing the will of the Iraqi people to build atolerant Iraq that cares about peace  based upondemocracy  the building of constitutional institutionsand respect for and pursuit of its internal politicalprocess  which would be embodied in theestablishment of the Iraqi National Congress thatwould build such institutions  formulate a newconstitution  and conduct new and free elections.Kuwait aspires to strong brotherly relations with thenew  free Iraq  based on mutual respect  goodneighbourliness  respect for bilateral agreements andresolutions under international law.We welcome  likewise  the creation of a tribunalfor former military officers responsible for crimesagainst the Iraqi people and the people of Kuwaitcommitted during the invasion of Kuwait  as well asfor the killing of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and third-country persons.We express our appreciation to the UnitedNations and international and regional organizations ósuch as the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organizationof the Islamic Conference  the League of Arab Statesand the Gulf Cooperation Council ó for their supportand their condemnation of the old regime  which killedprisoners of war and concealed that crime for morethan a decade in flagrant violation of internationalhumanitarian law. We also thank the interimGovernment  which is seeking to investigate what hashappened to those prisoners of war.We are following with great concern the tragicsituation faced by the Palestinian people in the occupiedArab territories as a result of Israeli policies and practicesthat contravene international and humanitarian law.We reaffirm our support to the struggle of thePalestinian people and their legitimate claim to recovertheir political rights. We therefore call upon Israel torespect Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338(1973)  and 1515 (2003)  the principle of land forpeace  the road map and the dismantling of the racialseparation wall. That is part of our integral vision forresolving the situation in the Middle East  which mustbe based on mutual respect and cooperation betweenall parties.To ensure stability in the Middle East  we mustalso work to eradicate weapons of mass destruction 51and all parties need to pursue the path of understandingand dialogue to implement the noble principles of theCharter of the United Nations governing inter-Staterelations and relations among the peoples of the world.We reiterate  in that regard  that the dispute betweenthe United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic ofIran concerning the three islands that belong to theEmirates should be resolved by peaceful means. Weurge the two parties to resolve that dispute as rapidly aspossible.Regarding Darfur  we are all concerned about thehumanitarian tragedy there. We believe that the Sudanis striving to find a reasonable solution to thathumanitarian dilemma.Kuwait is pursuing international and regionalefforts to achieve peace and security in bothAfghanistan and Somalia  which for many years havesuffered from a lack of authority and the deteriorationof their economic and political situation owing to theconflicts between various local forces and factions. Wesupport the good offices of the United Nations andregional organizations that have made progresspossible at the political level. We hope that thoseefforts will continue so that national reconciliation inthose brotherly nations can be achieved.The information revolution and the vasttechnological progress in the areas of trade andcommunications have brought about interdependence.The world has become a little village  every corner ofwhich can now be reached. Many States  anddeveloping countries in particular  have thereforeundergone fundamental changes in their economicframework in order to take advantage of thephenomenon of economic globablization and ensureprogress and development for their peoples. Despitethe benefits of those policies  such as the liberalizationof international trade and the lowering of tariffbarriers  many countries  especially the least developedamong them  are suffering from marginalization andmany aggravated social problems  such as poverty hunger and the spread of diseases resulting from thedeterioration of their economies. For that reason  wecall upon the international financial institutions  andthe World Trade Organization in particular  to givespecial attention to the developing countries and toconsider providing financial support to improve theireconomic and social situations. We call upon thedeveloped countries to increase their developmentassistance  to open access to their markets  and toreduce the debt burden of the developing countries sothat they are able to strengthen their economicinfrastructure.Kuwait continues to support developmentprojects in many developing countries through regionaland international institutions and organizations  as wellas through the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab EconomicDevelopment  which we had the honour of establishingover four decades ago and through which we haveprovided more than $11 billion to over 100 countries.At the Millennium Summit our leaders laid outthe paths to be followed and goals to be attained. Let uswork together to achieve a better future for all peoples."
"96",3935,"LAO",59,2004,"On behalf of thedelegation of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  Iwould like to thank Mr. Julian Hunte  President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session  for hisdedication and hard work and to welcome Mr. JeanPing  Minister of State  Minister for Foreign Affairs Cooperation and la Francophonie of the Republic ofGabon  as President of the Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession.On this occasion  I would also like to commendSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts tomake the United Nations more effective  and especiallyfor taking the initiative to establish a High-level Panelon Threats  Challenges and Change to address UnitedNations reform and to propose recommendations to theGeneral Assembly. The member States all look forwardto seeing and considering those eagerly awaitedrecommendations.In 2000  the Millennium Declaration  a landmarkdocument  manifested our strong will to face the mostpressing challenges of our time. The MillenniumDevelopment Goals have become fundamentalbenchmarks in our efforts to achieve economic growthand sustainable development. Over the past four years their implementation at the global and regional levelshas proved to be successful in some countries  whilemany developing countries  especially the leastdeveloped  have had difficulties in attaining thosegoals due to unfavourable conditions. In that context the Lao People’s Democratic Republic views the high-level plenary meeting to review the implementation ofthe Millennium Declaration  scheduled for next year  asa crucial opportunity for the international communityto take stock of the progress made and to developappropriate measures to secure the necessary financialresources for better achievements in the years ahead.The international situation continues to bemarked by rapid and complex evolution. In thatcontext  peace and international security must bepreserved at all costs. The Non-Aligned Movement  atits ministerial conference held in Durban  South Africa from 17 to 19 August 2004  reiterated its commitmentto multilateralism in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security. The strengthening and promotion ofthe multilateral process would certainly contribute tothe world’s efforts effectively to address internationalchallenges.Today  weapons of mass destruction — be theychemical  biological or nuclear — all pose majorthreats to peace and security at the regional and globallevels and are far from being totally eliminated.2Therefore  we should all work collectively to ensurethat those inhumane weapons disappear from the faceof the Earth.Terrorism continues to bring disaster to humanityand endangers national and international security. Theinternational community is urged to further cooperateat the national  regional and international levels in thefight against terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations. All acts of terrorism  wherever and bywhomever committed  are criminal and unjustifiable.To that end  the Lao People’s Democratic Republicreaffirms its position to continue to cooperate with theinternational community based on the principles of theUnited Nations Charter  international law and relevantinternational conventions.The year 2005 will mark the fiftieth anniversaryof the Asian-African Conference. The commemorationof this golden jubilee will be a crucial opportunity tosolemnly reaffirm the validity of the core principles ofthe Bandung spirit  which are solidarity  friendship andcooperation  and which continue to serve as aneffective foundation for resolving global problems andpromoting good relations among the countries and thepeoples of the world.Recently  the increasingly deteriorating securitysituation in Iraq has been cause for concern. The LaoPeople’s Democratic Republic expresses the hope thata peaceful solution can be found to achieve peace andstability and to ensure the well-being of the Iraqipeople.We commend the efforts being made to find apeaceful solution to the Korean Peninsular issuethrough the convening of three rounds of six-partytalks. We hope that all parties concerned will pursuethose talks in order to achieve permanent peace andsecurity in the Korean Peninsula  thus creatingfavourable conditions for peaceful reunification.Violence continues unabated in the occupiedPalestinian territories  including East Jerusalem. Suchviolence will hurt the peace efforts in the Middle Eastand prolong the suffering of the peoples of the region.Thus  we urge the parties concerned to engage inserious dialogue  settle their conflict and realize thevision of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side byside in peace within secure and recognized borders  inaccordance with the relevant Security Councilresolutions.Last month  at its Durban Ministerial Conference the Non-Aligned Movement called once again upon theGovernment of the United States to put an end to theeconomic  financial and trade embargo against Cuba.That unilateral embargo  which has caused immensematerial losses and economic damage to the people ofCuba  runs counter to the United Nations Charter andinternational law. It is time that the embargo was lifted.Capitalizing on the momentum achieved at thehistoric international ministerial conference at Almaty Kazakhstan  to address the special needs of landlockeddeveloping countries (LLDCs)  the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic  as Chairman of the Group ofLLDCs  has spared no efforts to bring benefits to thesevulnerable developing countries. We would like toconvey our appreciation to eleventh session of theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development which recognized LLDCs as small and vulnerableeconomies. We hope that such special recognition willbe granted by other international forums andorganizations  in particular the World TradeOrganization  as gaining access to internationalmarkets for products of interest to our countries willsignificantly help to overcome our geographicalhandicap as landlocked States.The global illicit drug problem and related crimeremain an issue of concern to the world community.Owing to its cross-border and international nature  thisproblem can be dealt with effectively only throughinternational cooperation. In an effort to contribute tothe fight against this scourge  the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic continues to build and intensifycooperation at the national  regional and internationallevels. As a result  opium cultivation in our countrydeclined significantly from 2003 to 2004  and we willstrive to eliminate opium cultivation by 2005. I takethis opportunity to appeal to the internationalcommunity to continue to grant financial support toassist our country in addressing a number ofchallenges  namely the treatment of opium addicts  thecreation of new and sustainable employment and theprovision of necessary infrastructures to preventformer opium poppy growers from replanting.Over the past year  the Lao people of all ethnicorigins  all walks of life and all religions have beenliving in solidarity and harmony. Social and politicalstability across the country remained solid. Theeconomy enjoyed a sustained growth rate of 6.5 percent. The poverty of the people has been gradually3reduced  and external relations of cooperation havebeen broadened extensively. Later this year  the LaoPeople’s Democratic Republic will be hosting the 10thAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)Summit and other related summits with ASEANdialogue partners. On that occasion  a number ofimportant documents will be adopted  aiming toaccelerate regional integration and the establishment ofthe ASEAN community by 2020.In its nearly 60 years of existence  the UnitedNations  has played its role in promoting internationalpeace and security and socio-economic development. Ithas had much success. As we enter the twenty-firstcentury  our world today is still confronted withnumerous complex problems including wars  armedconflicts  terrorism  global crime  human trafficking global warming  environmental degradation  HIV/AIDS and other diseases and the marginalization ofdeveloping countries  in particular the three mostvulnerable groups among them: the least developedcountries  the landlocked developing countries and thesmall island developing States. The internationalcommunity should cooperate and work collectivelythrough the United Nations to address the globalchallenges of our time.The United Nations needs to be reformed if theOrganization is to be more effective and moredemocratic. The General Assembly should also have animportant and more active role to play in themanagement of world affairs. With respect to theSecurity Council  we wish to reaffirm the position ofthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic  first expressedmany years ago  that there should be an increase in thenumber of permanent and non-permanent membersfrom the developed and developing countries  inaccordance with the principle of equitable geographicaldistribution and taking into account the relativeimportance of the various countries. In the samecontext  the Lao People’s Democratic Republicsupports Japan  Germany and India as permanentmembers in a new  expanded Security Council.All this would greatly contribute to achieving ourultimate goal of making the United Nations  ouruniversal Organization  an organization that can gainthe trust and the confidence of Member States."
"97",3978,"LBN",59,2004,"As thehead of Lebanon's delegation to the General Assembly I am pleased to congratulate Mr. Ping on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession.

I alsowant to acclaim the special relationship that mycountry has with his and to express our gratitude forthe support which his country  Gabon  gives to ourlarge Lebanese community working there and enjoyingits hospitality.I also wish to thank his predecessor  Mr. JulianHunte  for his effective leadership as President of theAssembly at the fifty-eighth session.Secretary-General Annan has earned our respectand appreciation for the efforts he has made to furtherthe United Nations goal of working for a just  secureand peaceful world.In past years  we in Lebanon used to come to thisforum seeking United Nations help. The UnitedNations has always come to our support  adoptingresolutions affirming Lebanonís independence sovereignty and territorial integrity. We must expressour gratitude to the United Nations for dispatching theUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  stationed onour frontiers with Israel  and for the continuing andeffective aid we get from the Organizationísspecialized agencies.Today  we come to this forum with a differentobjective. Our country is in good shape. It has regainedits position in the region. We have moved fromdestruction to construction  from rule by the militias tothe rule of law  from anarchy to stability and security and from division to unity. In the 1970s and 1980s ìLebanonizationî became a bad word. It stood foranarchy and infighting. Now  however ìLebanonizationî has regained its true  originalmeaning as a term standing for democracy  freedom pluralism and recognition of the other.Early this month  the Security Council adopted itsresolution 1559 (2004)  concerning Lebanon. Theresolution has two dimensions  one regional  the otherinternal. As for the regional dimension  the resolutioncalls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces still inLebanon. There are Israeli forces occupying part ofLebanon: the Shebaía farms and the surrounding area.Together with the rest of the Assembly  we call for theimmediate withdrawal of those forces. From thisrostrum  we also call upon Israel to halt its dailyviolations of our airspace.There are also Syrian forces in Lebanon. Thoseforces are on our territory at the request of theLebanese Government and in accordance withagreements signed by the two parties. Lebanon willaccept the presence of those troops as long as thesecurity situation in the region merits it. It is Lebanoníspolicy that not a single non-Lebanese soldier shouldremain on its soil. Our disagreement with the UnitedNations concerning the withdrawal of Syrian forceslies in the timing of the withdrawal; it is not adisagreement on the principle of withdrawal. Thetiming is under continuous discussion between theLebanese and Syrian Governments; it will depend ontheir assessment of the security situation in the region.It is also the policy of Lebanon to support the nationalresistance movement  which played an important rolein forcing Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon.As for the Council's resolution's internaldimension - relating to the amendment of ourConstitution - we consider it an unacceptableintervention in our internal affairs. Our Constitution which was promulgated in 1926  may be the oldest34democratic constitution in the entire Middle East.Successive Lebanese Parliaments have amended itmany times  always in accordance with its ownamendment mechanisms and by absolute majorities.Lebanon is a civilized democratic country. Itabides by international law and reveres the moralprinciples and values on which it is based. My countrywas a founding Member of the United Nations in 1945.It played a leading role in the formulation of theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. And from this rostrum  Lebanon has exposed and opposedall destructive and disruptive ideologies andmovements that we felt impeded the course ofcivilization and the future of humanity.Today  we stand together with the United Nationsin opposing international terrorism in all its forms.Lebanon has witnessed the horrors of terrorism on itssoil; it has witnessed innocent people being kidnapped tortured and killed. It knows what terrorism is allabout  and  as a result of first-hand knowledge  itcondemns it in the strongest terms. We also condemnthose who wilfully confuse terrorism with the strugglefor national liberation and independence. There arethose who exploit the universal revulsion againstterrorism to smear national liberation movements bybranding them as terrorist. National liberation is a rightand an honour; terrorism is a crime and cowardice.Lebanon has recovered its stability and freedom.We are not here to ask anything specific for ourselves.We do  however  ask that the United Nations devotemore attention to our region. The region is in turmoil and it looks to the United Nations to help establishpeace. The Organization has been granted legitimacyby all nations in its quest to ensure peace and stability.We ask the following of the United Nations. First the Organization should increase its efforts to solve theMiddle East problem. It should do so by implementingits resolutions concerning Israel's withdrawal from theterritories it occupied in 1967  by giving thePalestinians an independent sovereign State and byensuring the return of Palestinian refugees to theirhomeland. The more the Middle East conflict isallowed to fester  the more difficult it will be to resolveand the more danger and war there will be in theregion.Secondly  the United Nations should assumegreater responsibility in resolving the violent conflictin Iraq and in restoring peace  stability and unity to theIraqis. The Iraqis have suffered greatly  and theydeserve strong and continuing support from the UnitedNations so that they can build a free  just anddemocratic order.Thirdly  the Organization should help the MiddleEast region to achieve a new stable order based on justand equitable solutions and on the right to self-determination  since that region is the birthplace of thethree monotheistic religions. The United Nationsshould also put an end to the arms race and to thewaste of capabilities and rid the region of weapons ofmass destruction.Fourthly  the United Nations should encouragethe establishment of civil organizations as a necessaryfirst step in the process of reform and democratization.It is difficult to build an accountable democraticsystem without diverse and pluralistic civil institutions.Democracy is based on political parties  trade unions civil institutions  humanitarian organizations andassociations of all kinds  which are the foundations ofreform and democracy.Lebanon has a clear vision about the future of theregion and of its civilization. It wants to play a decisiverole in that future  as it did in forging an Easterncivilization in the region  based on the most profoundprinciples of Christianity and Islam.Lebanon is an international country  bigger thanits size and population  due to its emigrants  whoinhabit every nook and cranny of the world. Whereverthey may be  the Lebanese are emissaries of innovationand production. Some countries may take pride inexporting weapons and in deploying armies  butLebanon  since the dawn of history  has prided itself onexporting its precious young people  who  in allcontinents  assume the highest posts in universities research centres  industries and businesses.Lebanon supports the United Nations because ofits universal views on humanity and its future. In thepast  my country may have suffered precisely becauseof its universalism  its openness and its freedom.Because Lebanon has given much  Lebanon deservesmuch.Finally  I wish the General Assembly and itsMain Committees every success in addressing themany important items on the agenda. Lebanon willparticipate actively in all these proceedings  in any waythat will help to attain the objectives of the UnitedNations and advance the universal cause of freedomand peace."
"98",4025,"LBR",59,2004,"It is an honour for me tostand here today to address the General Assembly at itsfifty-ninth session.When  in 1945  Liberia joined the efforts toestablish this Organization in order to bring an end to aglobal war and to pursue justice and maintain worldpeace  little did we know that we had subscribed to aninsurance policy that  59 years later  would providecoverage for Liberia and redeem its people and itssovereignty.As members know  Liberia is a country intransition from continued crisis to sustainable peace.The United Nations  the United States and theEuropean Union have all worked with the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) tostabilize the situation  attending to the humanitariancrisis and navigating the difficult road to peace. Weremain immensely grateful for the role of South Africaand ECOWAS for providing regional leadership in thesearch for peace in Liberia. The pivotal roles played byboth the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Republicof Ghana deserve special commendation. We areparticularly grateful to Secretary-General Annan andthe United Nations  the United States and the EuropeanUnion for partnering with ECOWAS in theseendeavours.I am pleased to inform this Assembly that theComprehensive Peace Agreement singed in Ghana inAugust 2003 continues to guide the Liberian peaceprocess. A power-sharing National TransitionalGovernment comprising all warring factions  politicalparties  and civil society is working. The ceasefireagreement signed on June 17  2003  continues to beinsured by the 15 000-strong United Nations Missionin Liberia (UNMIL)  operating with a Chapter VIImandate. The force is now disarming and demobilizingall armed groups.At the beginning of the United Nations Missionin October 2003  we estimated that some 38 000combatants would have submitted themselves to thedisarmament and demobilization program. Today 73 600 fighters have been disarmed. Over 22 000pieces of serviceable weapons of all kinds have beensurrendered and decommissioned  and more than175 million rounds of ammunition collected anddestroyed by UNMIL.Meanwhile  the high number of combatantsdisarmed and demobilized has overwhelmed ourcapacity to rehabilitate and reintegrate them. Theabsence of social infrastructures exacerbates thesituation. War-related damage to the nationalinfrastructures and community facilities is extensive.Without exception  all communities have lost theircapacity to accommodate and support even theslightest caseload of returnees.Some of the ex-combatants have enrolled in civilworks programmes sponsored by UNMIL  theEuropean Commission  the United States Agency forInternational Development and the People’s Republicof China. A significant number are seeking readmissioninto regular academic programmes. Others areenrolling in vocational training institutions to acquirelife skills.There are special efforts being made for childrenand female former fighters to receive specialized careand training through programmes sponsored by UnitedNations agencies and other international and local non-governmental organizations.As a direct result of the civil conflict  a sizeablenumber of Liberians are currently residing outside ofthe country  mostly as refugees. As disarmament nearscompletion and as our Government extends itsauthority  the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees is preparing for organized repatriation ofLiberians. In addition  some 500 000 internallydisplaced persons are expected to commence leavingtheir camps and returning to their local communitiestowards the end of October this year.The role the United Nations is playing to bringsustainable peace and human dignity to our countryand people is phenomenal and indicative of the newchallenges which the United Nations and theinternational community must face and meet head on ifwe  the people of the United Nations  are to live inpeace and enjoy our inalienable rights. Peace and thefreedom to enjoy those rights under the rule of lawrequire not just curative measures  but preventiveactions to address the problems of poverty  ignoranceand disease of the world’s poorer peoples andcountries.The National Transitional Government’s recoveryagenda has as its focus the improvement of the well-being of our people by the creation of employmentopportunities to put returnees and ex-combatants towork. Our recent history teaches us that when ex-combatants are not meaningfully rehabilitated andreintegrated and that when many in our society are notstakeholders and are excluded  we run the risk that theywill return to violent crime and conflict. We areextremely worried about that prospect.Against that background  there is now realurgency to revive our economy and create jobs. That iswhy  in June of this year  I pleaded with the SecurityCouncil to lift the sanctions imposed on diamonds andtimber — two sectors that hold great potential for jobcreation and economic recovery. Sanctions continue tohurt Liberia. It must not be forgotten that the sanctionswere imposed primarily because Liberia was exportingconflict by trafficking in arms for diamonds. A relatedreason was the lack of transparency and accountabilityin the management of State resources  especially fromthe forestry sector and the maritime programme. Thatsituation no longer obtains.Our Government is not buying arms. To thecontrary  we are disarming tens of thousands ofcombatants. We are also cooperating with theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)  the World Bank the African Development Bank  the EuropeanCommission and the United States Treasury and StateDepartments in putting into place proper mechanismsfor transparency and accountability in the use of Stateresources.In that regard  the European Commission isfunding the systems audit of five revenue-generatingagencies and the Central Bank of Liberia. The WorldBank is working with the Government to reform thepublic procurement system and is assisting the LiberiaPetroleum Refinery Corporation to put into place asystem of international competitive bidding ofpetroleum products. The IMF is assisting the CentralBank to introduce transparency in the management ofthe foreign exchange regime. The United StatesTreasury Department is engaged with us in financialsector reforms  particularly in the areas of monetarypolicy  revenue enhancement  budgeting andexpenditure controls. Also  the United States StateDepartment is working with the Forestry DevelopmentAuthority in implementing an environment-friendlyforestry reform programme.18Given all these efforts  we once again appeal tothe Security Council to lift the sanctions to enable us tocreate jobs and to attend to the enormous social needsof our people.In early February  the United Nations  incollaboration with the World Bank and the UnitedStates Government  co-hosted a donors conference forLiberia. The aim of the conference was to seek supportfor our two-year reconstruction plan. The internationalcommunity responded generously with pledges of $520million. I am happy to report that  to date  $455 millionof those pledges have been classified as firmcommitments. Projects are under way to spend thosefunds and to bring much needed relief to our people.Elections in Liberia are not new  but most havebeen characterized by widespread rigging. Thus  unfairelections in themselves have been a major source ofconflict in Liberia. This time around  Liberians aredetermined to undertake free and fair elections as anequity participation in the investment of sustainablepeace and national renewal. The TransitionalGovernment remains committed to the holding ofelections in October 2005 and to the smooth transfer ofpower to a democratically elected Government inJanuary 2006.Liberia has developed strong collaborative effortswith our neighbours in the Mano River Union to endthe activities of armed non-State actors. The ManoRiver Union countries have committed themselves tostrictly adhering to the Non-Aggression and SecurityCooperation Treaty of the Union and the meticulousimplementation of the fifteenth protocol. Liberiareiterates its commitment to cooperating with allprovisions on security and peace as enshrined in thecharters of the United Nations  the African Union  theEconomic Community of West African States and theMano River Union.We call on the United Nations to urgently engagein crisis prevention and in strengthening the peace inour region. In that regard  we urge this body to workwith regional and subregional organizations  such asthe African Union and ECOWAS.Today more than ever before  the utility of theUnited Nations is being tested. Never before has theworld faced so many different types of conflicts in somany different places at the same time. However  weare encouraged by the fact that the high number andcomplexity of those problems have not lessened thedetermination of Member States to stay the course offostering international peace and stability.The threat posed by global terrorism  combinedwith widespread poverty  especially in developingcountries  constitutes a real barrier to the attainment ofthe Millennium Goals.The continued existence of conflicts in theMiddle East provides a source of worry. After decades it is time that a workable solution be found to theIsraeli-Palestinian issue.The current Iraqi crisis is also troubling to aworld body searching for solutions to world conflicts.Liberia calls for a unified global approach to the Iraqiquestion and urges the United Nations to play an activerole in the resolution of that crisis.In Africa  news from the Darfur region in Sudanis frightening. We support the position of the AfricanUnion on the Darfur problem and ask for a speedyresolution of the crisis so as to bring relief to theregion.The recent massacre of nearly 200 Tutsi inBurundi sends a grim reminder of the 1994 genocide inRwanda. Urgent action should be taken to contain thesituation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Making peace is difficult because the resolutionof conflicts sometimes engenders new contradictionsthat must be addressed. In post-conflict situations likeours  where national capacities have been decimated the continued goodwill of the international communityto assist in reconstruction is paramount. We thus prayfor the continued engagement of the United Nations inglobal crises.Liberia has gone through 15 years of violentconflicts. In Accra  Ghana  in 2003  Liberians reasonedtogether to reject war and build a better society. Liberiais now breaking through from being a failed State tobeing a democratic and vibrant society. There is now agrowing sense of hope and optimism among ourpeople. We cannot fail now  for we have seen the costof war as compared to the price of peace. Liberianshave finally resolved to choose the path of peace andstay on it."
"99",4069,"LBY",59,2004,"It is my pleasure to congratulate you  Sir on your election as President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-ninth session. Your election is a testament tothe greatness of our African continent.I am pleased to address the Assembly and sharethe views of my country  Libya  on a number of seriousand sensitive issues that we deem important for jointinternational action and increased universalcooperation.Last year  we relinquished our right to speak tothe President of the African Union in the expectationthat he would speak for the entire Union. It seems however  that the African Union has no post of ForeignMinister and that the Ministers of member States weretherefore compelled to speak instead. Thus  I amobliged to speak now.All States obviously agree that the currentstructure and the rules of procedure of the United14Nations are flawed  and all States agree on the need forreform. Indeed  before we can discuss reform in theMiddle East  the former republics of the Soviet Unionor any other area of the world  we must first reform theUnited Nations. Before we speak about lack ofdemocracy in the world  we must first recognize thelack of democracy in the United Nations. Furthermore because the General Assembly is the parliament ofparliaments and the Security Council is the governmentof governments  we have no right to talk aboutdemocracy and reform in the world unless we firstreform the structure of the United Nations.The past 59 years have demonstrated that theGeneral Assembly is merely a decorative body withouta soul and that the authority lies with the SecurityCouncil  which controls all the work of the UnitedNations. It is the one and only authority. My countrytherefore proposes that the upcoming sixtieth sessionof the General Assembly should be decisive andimportant  and that invitations should be extended toall world leaders to participate. We should announcethat decisions on radical reform for the United Nationswill be taken at the sixtieth session. God willing President Muammar Al-Qadhafi  in what will be hisfirst visit to the General Assembly  will attend thatsession  which will be a historic milestone involving aconfrontation with the grave and unjust situationcurrently prevailing at the United Nations.We propose that the sixtieth session be held inGeneva — the geographical centre of the world — tofacilitate the attendance of all world leaders andpresidents  even if additional funds have to beallocated in order to convene the meeting in Geneva.My country is ready to contribute financial support forthat endeavour.There are two options before us. Our first optionis to transfer the authority to invoke Chapters VI andVII of the Charter from the Security Council to theGeneral Assembly. If that cannot be done  we have nochoice but to declare the General Assembly null andvoid and to stop pouring money into this moribundbody.Our second option is to increase the membershipof the Security Council by allocating seats to newentities such as the African Union  the Association ofSoutheast Asian Nations and Latin America. Inaddition  the right of veto will have to be reviewed andmade subject to new rules at the same time as themembership of the Security Council is expanded.We warn that  unless these reforms areimplemented  the United Nations will cease to exist  asunilateral actions are taking place outside the confinesof the United Nations.The African Union must have a permanent seaton the Security Council. That seat will be held by theUnion’s members in rotation.As the sixtieth session of the General Assemblyapproaches  Libya is presenting a unique  bold andstrong initiative to eliminate its programmes ofweapons of mass destruction  including nuclear andchemical weapons  and hand over related equipment tothe International Atomic Energy Agency.Libya played the central role in the establishmentof the African Union and contributed effectively to theliberation of colonized and oppressed peoples. Libya with its 2 000-kilometre coastline along theMediterranean Sea  is at the centre of the world and isboth a place of conflict and a haven for tourism. TheMediterranean Sea without Libya is inconceivable  asis the south Mediterranean coast without Libya. Libyagave birth to the third universal theory — the middleground between capitalism and communism — andpresented the world with the Green Book  whichresolves the political  economic and social problems ofsociety in its three sections. Accordingly  Libyadeserves to have a permanent seat on the SecurityCouncil.Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi presented aproposal to world leaders  which they all approved.The proposal calls for the establishment of a committeeof wise men  consisting of President Nelson Mandela President Mikhail Gorbachev and President BillClinton  that would serve as an authority for resolvingthe conflicts of our world. The United Nations shouldadopt a resolution supporting that proposal.We must all continue to combat terrorism. If wewant to eliminate terrorism  we must first eliminate itscauses and not simply pursue its isolated operations.We must attack its root causes.If we want oil supplies and prices to remainstable  we must prevent wars and potential conflictsfrom occurring near oil fields.15Finally  Colonel Al-Qadhafi will soon address theissue of United Nations reform on his web site: www.alqadhafi.org."
"100",4102,"LCA",59,2004,"Saint Lucia supportedyour unanimous election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session  Sir  as it shares theview of Member States that you will provide importantleadership to this General Assembly. I extend sincerecongratulations to you and to the Government andpeople of your country  Gabon  on behalf of thedelegation of Saint Lucia  and on my own behalf  andpledge to work cooperatively with you in our commonendeavour.There is a personal note to my pledge of supportand cooperation. Just one year ago  this Assemblyhonoured my country and me by entrusting theleadership of the fifty-eighth session of this body tome. I am fully aware  therefore  of the tremendousresponsibility that falls to you as President  and OF thedemands and pressures of leadership of this  the UnitedNations sole universal organ. In a relay of leadershipthat began some 59 years ago  I have passed the batonto you  assured that this will be a productive andsuccessful fifty-ninth session.My year as President of the General Assemblygave me a keener appreciation of the myriad taskswhich the Secretary-General performs in the service of and to inspire confidence in  the United Nations. TheGovernment and people of Saint Lucia support him in26his continuing contribution to our efforts to address thecritical issues facing our Organization and our world.The picture of our twenty-first century world isfar different from that envisaged in the United NationsCharter. Instead of a world of peace  security andeconomic and social progress  in which human rights fundamental freedoms and international law are fullyrespected  today our world is buffeted by poverty;hunger; the spread of endemic disease  including HIV/AIDS; conflicts; war; terrorism  and other graveproblems.This is so despite the combined effort of theUnited Nations system and the enormous potential ofthe Organization to live up to the ideals  principles andpurposes of the Charter.The United Nations is passing through a period ofintense questioning and doubts as to its capacity andrelevance. It is the view of my Government that manyof the doubts and questions stem from the continuingchallenge posed to the Organization to transform theideals of the Charter into action. Those questions anddoubts have been intensified by the concern that someof the Organization’s most influential and powerfulMember States might turn away frommultilateralism — the very foundation of the UnitedNations — and follow the path of unilateral action.We can and we must  stop our unique andindispensable Organization from being battered by thetides of these turbulent times. We must better enable itto address the myriad problems with which peoples andnations are grappling. And we must reaffirm its statusas the world’s foremost multilateral organization. Butwe can only do so through our full commitment andresolve to ensure that the Organization and its MemberStates live up to the ideals of the Charter.We know that the Charter charges the UnitedNations to achieve the solution of economic problemscooperatively. That puts the Organization on the frontline of what  for many States  particularly those in thedeveloping world  appears to be a very long road tosustainable development. Nowadays  it is a roadconstructed primarily around globalization and tradeliberalization  which have mostly delivered on theirpromises of economic advancement to developedcountries  but have yet to deliver on those promises tomany others  mostly developing countries.It cannot be disputed that current inconsistenciesand inequities in the global trading system arewidening the gap between rich and poor  haves andhave-nots. It is not surprising  therefore  thatdeveloping countries  particularly in the framework ofthe World Trade Organization (WTO)  are assertingthat globalization and trade liberalization should notundercut their sustainable development prospects  andthat there ought to be a fair and equitable globaltrading system.Agricultural subsidies  market access  non-tariffbarriers to trade  low or falling commodity prices andspecial and differential treatment — all those issuesbeg for constructive dialogue and decisive action particularly in the interest of the developing world.Specific mandates for trade and development issuesmay reside in other organizations  including the WTO the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.But the United Nations has a leading role to play inbringing coherence — here I underscore the wordcoherence — to debate and policy-setting on thoseissues  in line with its Charter mandates. Its efforts inthat area have the full support of my Government.The spate of deadly hurricanes that continue totraverse the Caribbean region  have brought sharplyinto focus the issues on which small island developingStates (SIDS)  including Saint Lucia  have urged theUnited Nations and the international community to act.We have reiterated  for example  that SIDS arevulnerable and that special and differential treatment fair prices for commodities and development financingare essential to their sustainable development.In just a few short weeks  hurricanes havebrought death and destruction throughout theCaribbean region  and  indeed  also to the Bahamas andthe United States. There was tragic loss of life in oursister Caribbean countries and territories — 37 inGrenada  20 in Jamaica; and even now  Haiti is stillcounting the cost in lives lost. Property andinfrastructural damage was immense  particularly inGrenada. Hurricane “Ivan the terrible” destroyed 90per cent of that country’s physical infrastructure. I sayto this Assembly that when a small island developingState loses 90 per cent of its physical infrastructure inthe space of a few hours  the challenge to that countryis formidable.For Grenada  it is like starting over. Grenadamust rebuild its infrastructure  economy 27communications systems  hospitals and schools everything from the ground up to restore the quality oflife for its people. But how  and with what resourceswill it rebuild? The member States of the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) have made a commitment toGrenada  but can only assist to the extent that theirmeans allow. Given their own resource constraints how far can that assistance be expected to go? TheGovernment and people of Grenada and of CARICOMare highly appreciative of the condolences expressed inthis Hall  and for offers of assistance. But Grenadaneeds much more. The Government of Saint Luciacalls upon the international community to make acommitment  as a matter of urgency  to thereconstruction of Grenada. We urge the convening  atan early date  of an international donor conference forthe purpose of mobilizing the resources required forthe reconstruction effort.In keeping with the international commitment topromote the sustainable development of SIDS  SaintLucia calls upon the development partners and theinternational donor community to work together withSIDS to address their vulnerability and other criticalissues frontally. The International Meeting for the 10-Year Review of the Barbados Programme of Action forthe Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States  to be convened in Mauritius inJanuary 2005  gives everyone yet another opportunityto do so. Saint Lucia urges all States  developed anddeveloping  and particularly partners and donors  to berepresented at the International Meeting at the highestlevel. In particular  we urge that commitments toprovide resources for the implementation of theBarbados Programme of Action  are kept.Indeed  this fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly will be a pivotal one in respect ofcommitments made internationally  including thosemade in the critical area of HIV/AIDS. The session isalso crucial to positioning us for the 2005comprehensive review of commitments made infurthering the United Nations development agenda including the Millennium Development Goals. Even aswe prepare for the High-level Plenary that willexamine the successes and failures in implementing theoutcomes of more than a decade of United Nationsconferences and summits in the economic and socialfields  the disjuncture between what we have agreedand what we have done in the interest of the peoples ofthe world becomes self-evident.We must ask ourselves why it is that we continueto fail the poor  the hungry  the sick and thedisenfranchised among us  despite the numerousspecialized  high-level meetings we have convened toaddress their condition? And why is it that we appearincapable of meaningful action beyond the boundariesof those meetings? If we cannot bring relief to the vastnumbers of marginalized and disadvantaged among us if we cannot advance growth and development particularly for developing countries  we can restassured that we will lose  or continue to lose  theconfidence of the people of the world. There istherefore one message we must take into the 2005high-level event: agreement on outcomes ismeaningless if it is not followed by practical andeffective implementation. We must act to implementand we must act now.It is asserted that peace and security are notpossible without development and that development isnot possible without peace and security. Saint Luciaagrees with this point; both are central to the purposesand principles of the Charter. We must  however remain vigilant that our development agenda is noteclipsed by a single-minded focus on conflict and war which continue to cast a giant and deadly shadow overour world.The function given to the United Nations — andparticularly to the Security Council — for themaintenance of international peace and security is anexceptional one. How effectively the Organizationcarries out that function is an important determinant ofits standing in the eyes of the people who need it mostand of world public opinion. Therefore  we must beconsistent in our global strategy for world peace andsecurity. Importantly  the United Nations must not beseen as an Organization so mesmerized by crises that itis slow to act decisively to address critical issues of lifeand death. The action we take  after all  should presentour best hope for a more peaceful and more secureworld.We know that conflict and war have costs that areincalculable  particularly in human lives  and can haveno happy ending. Today  Iraq remains an unsettled fractured country. The United Nations has aresponsibility to the people of Iraq to work with themto restore peace  security and prosperity to theircountry. In this  the Organization must ultimately takeits lead from the people of Iraq; it is only they who candevise uniquely Iraqi solutions to Iraqi problems and28determine the kind of future to which they arecommitted.Regarding another crisis  my Government isdisappointed that the road map to peace in the MiddleEast appears to have been put aside  and hopes thatnew initiatives will be undertaken urgently towardssettling that long-standing situation  which continues tocause so much grief.Every day  news stories and commentaries in themedia remind us of the level of violence and perils inour world. The complex and uncertain threat ofterrorists and terrorism constitutes a critical factorcontributing to the rising tide of violence  death anddestruction. Recently  terrorism became a reality forhundreds of victims in the Russian Federation. MyGovernment extends its sympathy to the Governmentof Russia and to all victims of terrorism and theirfamilies worldwide. Even with our best efforts  it is notalways possible to know where or when terrorists willstrike again  nor can we say with any certainty thatcurrent efforts against terrorism have made the world aless dangerous place.We can say  however  that the root causes ofterrorism are symptomatic of problems  someseemingly intractable  around the globe; that terrorismis global in its impact; and that its solution must beglobal. In addressing the problem of terrorism  wemust also look to dealing with the hunger  poverty andinequities spoken of by President Lula da Silva ofBrazil and many other concerned leaders  which aregiving rise to the hopelessness and despair beingexperienced by millions and millions of people all overthe world. Greater efforts must be made to resolvethose critical problems.As we survey the enormity of the challenges theUnited Nations and the global community face today we must ask ourselves: Is our 59-year old Organizationequipped to confront those challenges? There is acurrent of reform within the Organization. A series ofprogressive steps were taken during the fifty-eighthsession  in particular  to advance revitalization of thisAssembly. However  the Assembly still has todemonstrate its ability to reconcile the interests of itsmember States and to take action to implement the hardchoices which revitalization of this important universalforum requires. We must ensure that the gains made arenot reversed.During the fifty-eighth session  the debate wasalso opened on Security Council reform  and someprogress was made to lift this matter out of itsmoribund state. The Security Council must indeed bereformed  so that its actions can carry more weight andacceptance internationally. The Council must beexpanded to make it more representative of thegenerality of the membership  and a way must be foundto address the serious concerns surrounding the vetoprivilege. Recent reform initiatives should impactprocesses under way and practical recommendationsaimed at ensuring that the Security Council is adequateto its mandates  including those that might be taken upat the 2005 high-level plenary meeting.Since the establishment of the United Nations non-governmental organizations and civil society haveworked constructively with this Organization toaddress pressing global problems. We now have areport on how the relationship might be made morebeneficial. It is our hope that the Assembly willcarefully consider this matter  as the support of non-governmental organizations and civil society is tooimportant to be taken for granted.The Government and people of Saint Luciabelieve that confidence in the United Nations is beingrestored. We believe that the world’s people expect theOrganization to take a leading role in resolving theirmost pressing problems. We believe that the UnitedNations can be many things to many people. TheOrganization has been sorely challenged in recentyears  but has shown resolve in rising to the challenge.With an abundance of political will  the principles andpurposes of the United Nations Charter can triumph.The Government and people of Saint Lucia are inspiredby that prospect."
"101",4129,"LIE",59,2004,"The United Nationsfaces unprecedented challenges: the recent past hasbrought about a worrisome erosion in the standing andcredibility that this great Organization has enjoyed24worldwide. Use of military force without priorauthorization by the Security Council and increasinglydifficult and dangerous conditions under which UnitedNations personnel operate in many places are but twoexamples illustrating this trend.Secretary-General Kofi Annan has given a two-tiered response. First  he issued a call for anunequivocal commitment to the principle ofmultilateralism  upon which this Organization is built.And secondly  he commissioned a report from eminentand highly experienced personalities on how theOrganization should address new threats andchallenges.Liechtenstein believes that this was the rightresponse. An unequivocal and unwavering commitmentfrom all of us is the basis for collective action and forobserving the rules we have set for ourselves. Only thiscommitment can give meaning to our decisions totackle new challenges  and only this can enable us tofurther develop a rules-based framework in order tolook confidently into the future.We must acknowledge the fact that the challengeswe are facing today were not foreseeable when thefounding fathers agreed on the terms which guide thework of this Organization. At the same time  we mustalways recognize the Charter of the United Nations asthe unique achievement that it is and examine ourcurrent ways of applying this great tool that was passeddown to us. It is therefore our obligation to conduct anin-depth and sober analysis of these new challenges inorder to make an informed decision about how best toaddress them within the framework of the UnitedNations system. Changes and creative approaches willbe needed.We therefore very much look forward toreceiving and considering the report of the High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change establishedby the Secretary-General. But however insightful theirfindings and however visionary their recommendationsmay be — and we have high hopes that they will be —the necessary decisions to expand the existingmultilateral architecture will have to be made by us the States gathered in this Assembly on the thresholdof the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Notin 10 years. Now. The time is right.In a globalized world  collective action is thenecessary response to a great number of challenges.Effective measures in numerous areas — theenvironment  HIV/AIDS  poverty-reduction  the fightagainst terrorism  to name but a few — can only betaken on the basis of genuine and efficient globalcooperation. Such cooperation can only be successfulif it is based on a set of transparent and clear rulesapplied in the same manner to everybody whoparticipates in it. International law is clearly theprimary instrument in this respect. However  we havewitnessed contradictory tendencies in the area ofinternational law  especially in the recent past.On the positive side  there have been landmarkachievements  most notably the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court. For the first time in thehistory of mankind  there is an independent Court based on a Statute negotiated by the internationalcommunity at a diplomatic conference  that has thecompetence to try individuals responsible for the worstcrimes when States themselves fail to do so. We aresadly reminded every day how much such aninstitution is needed. On the negative side  we haveobserved a dangerous erosion in the application oflong-standing international law standards  most notablyin the field of international human rights andinternational humanitarian law. The stage we havereached is critical and there can be only one response:We must urgently reverse this trend and uphold theprimacy of the rule of law  both nationally andinternationally.We firmly believe that the rule of law is anindispensable element of sound domestic policies —often referred to as good governance — and anindispensable part of sustainable developmentworldwide. International organizations  including theUnited Nations  are called upon to continue theirefforts to assist States in establishing and applying therule of law. We strongly support the efforts made overthe past year to strengthen the role of the UnitedNations in that respect.The rule of law at the domestic level must becomplemented at the international level through fulland unconditional respect for internationallyrecognized standards and transparent and fair rules ininternational decision-making. We have been very slowin dealing with the changes in the world and itsconsequences  most notably with regard to non-Stateactors who fall outside the framework of internationallaw as we have known it in the past. We must ensurethat all those individuals and groups that play asignificant role in the international arena are not25allowed to move in a legal vacuum and we must clarifywhich rules apply to them. That  however  we can docredibly and thus effectively only if we  theGovernments representing States  continue to respectthe standards we have created for ourselves.The one body that is particularly called upon inthat respect is the Security Council — to many  theepitome of the United Nations as a whole. The Councilmust meticulously observe the mandate given to itunder the Charter and ensure transparency and clarityin its decision-making. That is of special importancewhere the Council’s decisions directly affect the rightsand obligations of individuals who are not entitled toindividual legal remedies — a situation which can bedifficult to reconcile with the rule of law.A strong momentum is gathering for reform ofthe Security Council after more than 10 years ofdeliberations on that very complex topic. In light of thechallenges before the Council and the open questionsconcerning its role  in particular with regard toincreasing legislative activities  successful reform mustaddress all aspects. Enlargement to make that bodymore modern and representative is one such aspect. Webelieve that it is not sound for a universal Organizationto have its major decisions in a truly vital area taken byonly a handful of States.Furthermore  the working methods of theCouncil  its accountability to the membership as awhole and its mandate must also be addressed.Liechtenstein  and its delegation in New York inparticular  will continue to stand ready to make theircontribution to that end.In accordance with the Charter  the Council actson behalf of the entire membership in carrying out itsduties  and its decisions are binding on all MemberStates. All States should therefore take a strong interestin its work and make use of their opportunities tointeract with and express their views to the Council whether they are members or not. More openness andinclusiveness in the Security Council are still bothdesirable and feasible. The question remains  however:Is the Security Council too powerful or do we simplylack the necessary system of checks and balances? Wesupport a dynamic and strong Security Council andtherefore tend to the latter view  with a clear focus onan enhanced role for the General Assembly  the onlyuniversal organ of the United Nations. The measureson revitalization upon which we were able to agreeduring the last session show us how far we still have togo. It must be our goal to make this Assembly anefficient and effective body that can act and reactquickly and with resolve.We are still very far away from that goal. Themomentum gathered over the past year must betranslated into further  bold measures and trigger aprocess that is not reversible. This is no time forcomplacency and no time for indifference. ThisAssembly has historical tasks before it. We must leavelethargy and short-term national interests behind in theinterest of the greater good. Secretary-General KofiAnnan put it very aptly in his speech this past Tuesday:If we cannot reach agreement on the way forward history will make the decisions for us. We must set avision for the future and live up to our responsibility.We owe this to all future generations and to ourselves."
"102",4176,"LKA",59,2004,"I congratulate you  Sir on your assumption of the high office of President ofthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly andassure you of Sri Lanka’s fullest support andcooperation as you undertake the onerousresponsibility of presiding over the deliberations of theAssembly. I also thank the outgoing President  TheHonourable Julian Hunte  for his able and efficientconduct of the fifty-eighth session.The International Day of Peace we celebratetoday is indeed a significant event in the UnitedNations calendar. It is a day dedicated to the creationand pursuit of a culture of peace. As I speak today inthis Hall of peace  men  women and children in mycountry are celebrating the Day of Peace through awide variety of civil society events. Prayers andmeditations  the resonating chimes of bells and thegentle glow of candlelight are powerful symbols of ourdeep collective yearning for peace.We recognize that the pursuit of peace requiresmore than symbols. It requires consistent commitment patience  perseverance and  above all  resolute actionand consensus-building.Peace and the resolution of conflict throughdialogue take centre stage in the world today and henceneed to be accorded the highest priority on the UnitedNations agenda. All of us here are only too aware thatpeace is not the simple absence of war; it entails anactive engagement to understand and address the rootcauses that endanger peace and generate conflict.In Sri Lanka  my Government has for 10 yearsimplemented a series of programmes to engage thearmed group that has been engaged in armed conflict incomprehensive peace negotiations. We face thechallenges posed by an armed group using terror andsuicide bombs in pursuit of its demand for a separateState. My Government has adopted the policy that allconflicts have deep-rooted and real causes  and that wemust sift those causes from the acts of violence andterror and find the means to redress them. We believethat a lasting solution to conflict lies along the path ofpower-sharing between the centre and the regionswhere people of different communities live. We believethat this path can be found only through negotiationsand dialogue.We abhor violence and war. We believe in lifeand in the celebration of all that is human and decent.We believe that the moral justification of the State andof all human institutions  such as the United Nations  isthe protection and the safeguard of life. In numerouselections  my Government has requested and receivedmandates from our people to end the conflict through anegotiated settlement. We are committed to achievingpeace  a peace founded on democracy  respect forhuman rights  a pluralist polity and good governance.We are fully aware that peace is not achievedeasily. It is a constant struggle for mutual22understanding and reconciliation and the establishmentof the rule of law  justice and equality.The Buddha  popularly known as the Prince ofPeace  preached at length about peace and all that isrequired to achieve it  both within each individual andamong nations. I quote from the Dhammapada:“Victory breeds hatred. The defeated live in pain.Happily the peaceful live  giving up victory anddefeat”.We are deeply saddened at the violence instability  loss of life and human suffering in Iraq. Wein Sri Lanka know  and have experienced first-hand the impact of violence on society and the difficulty infinding solutions to problems of governance thatsatisfy all parties. As the Secretary-General’s SpecialRepresentative for Iraq recently pointed out  securitymeasures alone will not suffice to end violence andcreate stability and peace. Political consensus-building reconciliation  rehabilitation and the promotion of therule of law are essential for democracy to take root.Equally important in today’s interdependent increasingly globalized world is the commitment of theinternational community to remain engaged and toensure that Iraq does not become further plagued byviolence and fragmented along ethnic or religiouslines.None of us  as leaders and  above all  as mothersand fathers  can ever forget the sheer brutality of theterrorist attack earlier this month on a school in Beslan in the Russian Federation  which led to the loss of somany lives of children and adults. Terrorism in all itsmanifestations must be condemned and foughtrelentlessly and globally. While no cause justifiesunleashing terror upon the innocent  such outragesmust make us redouble our efforts to address their rootcauses and seek political and socio-economicexplanations and solutions to them.My Government is firmly committed to the globalendeavour to fight terrorism. We have signed andratified the United Nations conventions aimed atcombating that menace  and we continue to contributeto the process by chairing the Ad Hoc Committee onMeasures to Eliminate International Terrorism. Wehope that at this session of the General Assembly substantial progress can be made on the draftcomprehensive convention on international terrorismand the draft convention on nuclear terrorism.Sri Lanka believes in the United Nations and itspotential to be the principal forum where the voice ofthe poor  the defenceless and the weak is also heard  asmuch as the voice of the rich and powerful. In thatregard  we applaud the words today of Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who made a passionate appeal forupholding the rule of law  without discrimination throughout the world. We congratulate him on thecourageous leadership he gives to our world body. Itgives us confidence and hope at this moment of humanhistory when we question our collective ability to leadhumanity towards peace and prosperity.We also recognize the need for reform to renderthe United Nations more responsive to the needs andaspirations of all its Member States. We look forwardto the recommendations to be presented at this sessionof the General Assembly by the High-Level Panel onThreats  Challenges and Change  appointed by theSecretary-General.There is general agreement that the SecurityCouncil  as now constituted  does not reflect currentgeo-political realities. We share the concern over thelack of progress on the question of equitable regionalrepresentation and on an increase in the membership ofthe Security Council in both the permanent and non-permanent categories. For many years  the developingcountries have consistently urged that the compositionof the Security Council be broadened to accommodatethe basic principles of democratic representation including representation of the developing countries. Inthat context  we observe that Asia  the most populouscontinent and home to expanding economicpowerhouses of the world  is grossly underrepresentedin the present Council.We take note that four countries — Brazil Germany  India and Japan — will announce theirparticipation in a compact under which they willcollectively support their respective candidatures forpermanent status in an expanded Security Council. SriLanka supports their candidatures  as they comply withthe objective criteria applicable to the expansion of thepermanent membership of the Security Council. SriLanka would also wish to see a consensus emerge onthe permanent representation of Africa in the SecurityCouncil. Africa must be included in a finaldetermination on the future composition of the SecurityCouncil. It is also hoped that the Open-Ended WorkingGroup will continue to exert efforts to resolve alloutstanding issues expeditiously.23We propose that the General Assembly representing all Member States of the United Nations should play a larger and more active role as adeliberative and decision-making body.At the dawn of the new millennium  four yearsago  we forged a consensus to pursue a vision of aninclusive globalization process that provides benefits tothe widest possible segments of society. Setting asidethe commonplace clichés about globalization  weagreed on a number of goals to be implemented withinspecific time frames.My Government’s economic and socialdevelopment programmes were planned and put intoaction 10 years ago. We have now made the necessarychanges to align our plans more closely with theUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals. TheSri Lankan Government’s strategy for developmentseeks a constructive partnership between a strong andaccountable private sector  including foreign investors and a robust and responsive public sector. The majorthrust of our vision is to eliminate poverty  reduceinequalities and enhance the standard of living amongthe various sectors of our population  thus providingequal opportunities for all.On the subject of social progress  I mustcommend the United Nations for its continuedcommitment and perseverance in promoting andprotecting children’s rights. Apart from guaranteeingthe rights of every child to education and good healthservices  Sri Lanka believes that children must beprotected from abuse of alltypes — sexual  alcohol  drugs and tobacco. We haveadopted measures to combat those evils.Children in some of our countries suffer from theignominious practice of being used as child soldiers. InSri Lanka  we are addressing the problem of childconscription by the armed group  by seeking to engagethat group in the process of negotiations and bysupporting the activities spear-headed by UNICEF andby civil society organizations.Our economic strategy is market driven butgeared to achieve human development and prosperityat the grass roots level. We have crafted a policy andlaunched programmes to channel development effortsand resources to domestic capacity-builders at thevillage level who are the pillars of our nationaleconomy. The majority of our population live in therural areas and depend on agriculture for theirlivelihood. Promotion of small- and medium-scaleenterprises is therefore vital to sustain development.Sri Lanka draws strength from the recognition theUnited Nations has granted to small and mediumindustrialists in the developing world by declaring2005 as the Year for Micro-Credit.We witness with concern the emergence of acontrived association of certain religious beliefs withsome groups of fanatics. Extremism  violence andterrorism are the complete antithesis of the ethical andspiritual foundation of all religious philosophies andpractices. We should work resolutely to prevent thoseaberrations from becoming irreversible trends.On the other hand  we are disturbed to witnessreligious symbols being defamed or abused forcommercial purposes. Whether the symbols belong tothe Christian  Buddhist  Hindu  Islamic  Jewish or anyother faith  such abuse should be condemned andprohibited. The recent phenomenon of Buddhistsymbols being used for commercial purposes  thuscausing pain of mind to Buddhists all over the world isa case in point. Fortunately  most of thoseorganizations have agreed to refrain from such abuse inthe future. Sri Lanka  together with other like-mindedStates  has brought the situation to the attention ofUNESCO and other relevant intergovernmental bodies.We propose that the United Nations call upon thoseresponsible to pay due respect to religious symbols andpractices. That would be a fitting contribution by theUnited Nations to its own initiative on a dialogueamong civilizations.This year Sri Lanka will begin events to celebratethe fiftieth anniversary of our membership of theUnited Nations that falls next year in 2005. On thatoccasion  we will renew our commitment to thepurposes and principles of the United Nations. Weexpect the Organization to provide leadership in thetask of creating a world where understanding andharmony prevail  along with economic  scientific andtechnological advancement.My commitment — and that of my Governmentand the people of Sri Lanka — to the United Nationsremains undiminished. Our hope is that all MemberStates will cooperate fully with the United Nations torealize the Goals of the Millennium Declaration.Finally  I would like to say that our noble words unless translated quickly into palpable deeds  willremain no more than a silent testimonial to our24collective unwillingness or incapacity to transform thelives of our peoples when they cry out for attention andredress. If all that the United Nations can do for themis to churn out  periodically  ritual phrases and hollowinvocations to duty and responsibility  their frustrationwill swell and spread globally  challenging peace andstability. That must not happen.Let us leave this session of the General Assemblynot only with renewed commitment to the ideals of theOrganization  but with renewed vigour to address ourawesome responsibilities for alleviating the plight ofthe poor  the hungry  the disadvantaged and theoppressed."
"103",4218,"LSO",59,2004,"I would like  on behalf ofmy delegation  to join previous speakers incongratulating you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this session. Atthe same time  I would like to extend our complimentsto your predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  as well as to theSecretary-General  for a job well done.If there has been one consistent and predictablearea of convergence in our debates during GeneralAssembly sessions of the past  as well as during thecurrent session  it is the compelling need for a peacefuland stable world - a world where humankind lives inharmony  mutual tolerance and respect for thecollective benefit. For if we have peace and stability atthe national  regional and international levels humankind will be able to concentrate on the realissues of the development of this  our only world.Never before has our world been so insecure orfaced such enormous challenges. Sadly  this insecurityresults from manís inhumanity and his insensitivity tohuman life. Yet it is also through man's efforts that theeffects of such challenges can and must be mitigatedor - better still - defeated.It is common knowledge that the root cause of theworld's insecurity today is international terrorism andarmed conflict. Terrorist actions continue to haunt andto shock us. The recent murder of innocent  young defenceless school children in Beslan  Russia; thebombings in Indonesia; and daily killings in Iraq Palestine and Israel  are simply too ghastly tocountenance. Equally  the recent massacres of men women and children in refugee camps in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Burundi and theSudan are not only dastardly in the extreme  but standin stark contrast to everything that modern civilization humanity and morality espouse.Our world will continue to be insecure for as longas terrorists continue to be harboured and financed bysome States Members of the United Nations. We mustrecognize that none of us is immune from terrorism.But a more honest and practical solution would be forall States Members of the United Nations to committhemselves not to harbour or finance terrorists and theirorganizations. In that way  terrorists would have nosafe haven  thus rendering it possible to chase themfrom pillar to post until terrorist organizations areeliminated from our world.We submit that yet another  equally pragmatic solution may be found in the answer to the question:what is it that drives an inherently good human beingto commit such inhuman and senseless acts of Stateterrorism  organizational terrorism or individualterrorism? In short  we must confront the causes ofterrorism  honestly and without malice to anybody.Lesotho is deeply concerned by the fact thatarmed conflicts continue to cause suffering and hindereconomic growth in Africa and elsewhere. However we commend the United Nations for all its effortsaimed at the elimination of human suffering in armedconflict situations. When  in July 2003  the Assemblyadopted its historic resolution 57/337  on theprevention of armed conflict  it recognized thatmultilateral cooperation  under the auspices of theUnited Nations  could be an effective means to preventarmed conflict and to address its root causes.Furthermore  it acknowledged the responsibility of theUnited Nations to stand up to the challenge ofpreventing  rather than just responding to  conflict.I should like to take this opportunity to expressmy delegationís appreciation to the Secretary-General for the comprehensive report to be presented at thissession on the implementation of that importantresolution.For years now  the situation in Somalia has posed athreat to international peace and security. The swearing-in of Somalia's transitional parliament on 22 August2004  in Nairobi  Kenya  paves the way for genuinerecovery for Somalia. In that regard  my delegationcompliments the Government of Kenya  the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development  the AfricanUnion and all other stakeholders for their efforts tobring about normalcy in Somalia. We must not allowthe momentum to decrease  or the process to bederailed by those who seek to fuel hatred  division andthe killing of the people of Somalia  including as aresult of the smuggling of arms  which takes placedespite the arms embargo.The humanitarian and security crises engulfingthe Darfur region in the Sudan are a cause for seriousconcern to all of us. A lot has been said about that12grave situation  but not much has been done to containthe humanitarian and political crises.However  my delegation is hopeful that wordswill finally translate into action. We had hoped that with the help of the African Union mediators  therepresentatives of the Government of the Sudan and thetwo rebel groups - the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA)and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) - couldbe persuaded to sign and respect the protocol onsecurity. We reiterate our call to all concerned partiesto enter into negotiations. We wish to remind theGovernment of the Sudan that it is its primaryresponsibility  first and foremost  to protect the civilianlife of its nationals.The Great Lakes region remains politicallyvolatile. This situation has been exacerbated by therecent massacre of refugees from the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo at the Gatumba refugee camp inwestern Burundi. We hope that the fact that the Forcesfor National Liberation (FNL) have claimedresponsibility for the killings would makeinvestigations easier.The peace process in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo remains elusive  at a time when we hadthought that the gains that had been made from theCongolese dialogue  in South Africa  could beconsolidated. We reiterate the call by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for renewed commitment bythe Transitional Government in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  the Security Council and theinternational community to work in full partnership tosee the transitional process through to electionsscheduled for 2005.It is worth mentioning that  at the regional level the Southern African Development Community(SADC) heads of State or Government  at their recentsummit in Mauritius  mandated the SADC Organ onPolitics  Defence and Security Cooperation actively toremain seized of the situation in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo.My delegation has never condoned the killings ofIsraelis by the Palestinians or of Palestinians by theIsraelis. We have always considered the root causes ofthe problem in the Middle East  which is the illegaloccupation of Palestinian lands by Israel. That problemhas been exacerbated by the construction by Israel of aseparation wall in the occupied Palestinian territory.The International Court of Justice  the principaljudicial organ of the United Nations  on 9 July 2004rendered its advisory opinion that such constructionwas contrary to international law. We therefore appealto Israel to implement the important resolution adoptedby the General Assembly in view of the Courtísadvisory opinion. Moreover  it is our submission that unless and until the issue of the inalienable rights ofthe Palestinian people is addressed vigorously  urgentlyand truthfully  peace and security will remain elusivein the Middle East.We should perhaps recall that  four years ago  wegathered in this very Hall with hope for  andanticipation of  a better life for all humankind in thetwenty-first century  as we adopted the MillenniumDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals.We set time-bound and measurable goals forcombating  inter alia  poverty  hunger  disease  thespread of HIV and AIDS  illiteracy  environmentaldegradation and discrimination against women.Needless to say  we are today  as we were then committed to the achievement of those goals.However  we did not anticipate that  as weapproach the comprehensive review in 2005  theHIV/AIDS pandemic would have become the greatestthreat to life itself  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.Undoubtedly  the HIV/AIDS pandemic threatens torender futile and irrelevant all our efforts at thebetterment of humankind  including the attainment ofthe Millennium Development Goals.As early as the year 2000  Lesotho had declaredHIV/AIDS a national disaster  and various measureswere being taken at the national level to control andmanage the pandemic. We have not been alone in thatfight  fortunately. It is in that spirit that we wish torecognize and appreciate the dedication of Mr. StephenLewis  Special Envoy of the Secretary-General forHIV/AIDS in Africa  and of Mr. James Morris  SpecialEnvoy for Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa.Through his advocacy  Mr. Lewis has helpedLesotho start a robust programme of antiretroviraltreatment  while Mr. Morrisís initiatives have ensuredfood supply for vulnerable and orphaned children.Interventions of this nature give credence to the loftydeclarations adopted at various international summitson the HIV/AIDS pandemic  as they complement andstrengthen our own initiatives and limited resources.My delegation reiterates the call for increasedsupport for the New Partnership for Africaís13Development (NEPAD)  the framework for achievingthe Millennium Development Goals in Africa. It is yetanother mechanism that will enable African countriesto fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic  to eradicate povertyand to reduce the high unemployment rate.In the same context  the Millennium ChallengeAccount is indeed a worthy and commendableinitiative by the Government of the United States ofAmerica to launch the least developed countries on theroad to sound and sustainable development.The prevailing situations in Western Sahara andin Cuba continue to be of major concern. My de1egationwill ó because it must ó repeat the statement we havemade on many previous occasions: that the people ofWestern Sahara have suffered long enough. We havetherefore noted with appreciation the latestreaffirmation by the Security Council of its support forthe 1991 settlement plan  allowing the nations ofWestern Sahara to determine the future of the disputedterritory in a referendum. We hope that the referendumwill be held soon  and urge that this be the case.By the same token  the unilateral economicembargo against Cuba is causing untold misery to thepeople of that country. My delegation believes that when two countries are at war with each other  or whena country has been condemned by the internationalcommunity for gross misconduct  an economicembargo could be justifiable. However  we are notaware that any war has been declared against Cuba  orthat the Government of Cuba has compromised orbroken international law. We therefore remain in thedark as to what might justify the victimization ofmillions of Cubans by the unilateral economicblockade  for we contend that it is the sovereign democratic and  indeed  sacred right of the people ofCuba to determine the system of Government mostappropriate for their country. Accordingly  we urge thatnormalcy be restored to Cuba through the removal ofthe economic blockade.The coming into operation of the InternationalCriminal Court signifies  in our view  an end toimpunity. We are elated that there now exists aninternational body that can take over when nationalcourts are unable or unwilling to try perpetrators of themost egregious violations of human rights. We wouldindeed live in a safer world if State parties to the RomeStatute of the International Criminal Court adhered toit  and if the Court attained universal jurisdiction. Mydelegation encourages States that have not yet ratifiedthe Statute to do so as a matter of urgency ó indeed as a matter of common sense.We are pleased to note that the ICC hascommenced investigations in the Democratic Republicof the Congo and Uganda. We congratulate both thesesister countries for their cooperation with the ICC.In order for the United Nations family to addresstodayís challenges effectively  the Organization mustbe reformed  with the Security Council being thecentral focus of that effort. The Security Council mustreflect the reality of the international community in thetwenty-first century. That must be done against thebackground of multilateralism  upon which internationalpeace and security is premised. In that regard  allow meto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession  for the hard work and commitment hedisplayed as the Chair of the Open-ended WorkingGroup on the Reform of the Security Council.In conclusion  let me reiterate that it is onlythrough solidarity  unity of purpose and honesty amongus Member States that the United Nations will defeat inour time the greatest challenges ever to facehumankind. Otherwise  as Secretary-General KofiAnnan stressed in his opening statement  history willindeed judge us harshly."
"104",4244,"LTU",59,2004,"Allow me to express mysincere thanks to the President of the GeneralAssembly at its previous session  Julian Hunte  whoseable and skilful leadership we enjoyed during the pastsession. I also wish the President at the fifty-ninthsession  Jean Ping  a year of highly constructive andsuccessful work.It is our common duty to make this fifty-ninthsession a success and a fitting preparation for thesixtieth anniversary of the United Nations and the firsthigh-level review of the implementation of theMillennium Declaration  to be held next year. I believethese two occasions will offer an excellent frameworkfor a serious review of how the changing globalsituation can be met by a renewed United Nations.The risks and challenges of the new millenniumaffect us all and can be tackled only by commonefforts. Threats such as terrorism recognize no borders no differentiation by race  religion  or ethnicity. Thehorror  devastation and fear that terrorism brings are31the same whether in Casablanca  Madrid  New York Jerusalem or Beslan. Terrorism cannot be justified.And there can be no excuses and no leniency inconfronting it. The fight against terrorism must remainone of the priority tasks of individual Member Statesand of the United Nations.Even as we speak  humanitarian crises  poverty famine and disease continue to plague large parts of theworld. Across the globe  almost a billion peoplesurvive on less than a dollar a day. In sub-SaharanAfrica alone  around 300 million people live in abjectpoverty.In Iraq  the hope for universal and free electionsis marred by almost daily explosions  and securityremains too precarious for the United Nations toresume its pivotal role. The Middle East conflictcontinues taking its desperate death toll. And the wordgenocide is once again on our lips owing to the Darfurcrisis in Sudan.Therefore  we need to go the extra mile  to makeextra efforts to empower the United Nations to dealsuccessfully with these and other threats andchallenges  because the United Nations  despite all thecriticism  remains the only Organization capable ofembodying the principles of a truly global andeffective multilateralism. The United Nations can offerthe global reach and legitimacy necessary to enable theinternational community to act.As the nature of threats before us is changing andnew responses are needed  it is high time to agree onfuture policies and principles. Today we need to build ashared understanding of the nature of modern threats tointernational peace and security. Much depends on theability of the United Nations — that is  on us — toreach a new consensus on collective security. Ourstrength lies in our resolve to deal collectively withmajor challenges to peace  security and sustainabledevelopment.Today  more than ever before  the United Nationshas to play the leading role in building societies thatfollow the path of good governance  respect humanrights and the rule of law. We must be able to interveneand to prevent situations of massive human rightsviolations.We must also be firm in our struggle against allattempts to encroach upon human dignity  against allforms and manifestations of intolerance  anti-Semitism racism or Islamophobia. The international communityis vulnerable to the dangers posed by the proliferationof weapons of mass destruction  internationalorganized crime  environmental degradation and thespread of highly dangerous diseases  such asHIV/AIDS. Our common efforts against these andother threats must be universal  consistent  systematicand unwavering.No less universal and consistent must be ourefforts to reduce poverty and hunger  to diminishdisparities between and within nations  to improveliving conditions for women and children and to offer ahope of a dignified life to ever-larger segments of theworld’s population  as pledged in the MillenniumDeclaration.We need to press ahead with the implementationof the Millennium Development Goals. We need toreinforce our political will to make our globalpartnership more effective  by fully honouring thecommitments undertaken by the Monterrey Consensus.Without peace there is no development. Withoutdevelopment there is no peace. This recognized linkageof security and development should be better reflectedin our global agenda. Only by confronting these issuesin a coherent and coordinated manner shall we be ableto build our common future.Lithuania is ready to contribute bilaterally andmultilaterally to the implementation of the MillenniumGoals  and by sharing our experience of a nationalreform process. Our membership in the enlargedEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Allianceenables us to play a more active role by embracing theprinciples of development policy and by adopting therole of a donor.Next year we will discuss how to find consensuson the institutional and political framework for theUnited Nations to operate in the future. Lithuania fullyembraces the need for reform of the United Nations forthe sake of enhancing its effectiveness andinclusiveness. We hope that the outcome of thedeliberations of the High-Level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change will be able to contributesignificantly to giving a renewed impetus to the reformof the United Nations. If so  the next test will be to findbroad agreement on changes and follow theirimplementation.32I hope  too  that next year will be crucial inmoving ahead with the long-debated reform of theSecurity Council. The issue is not whether the SecurityCouncil should be enlarged. It is how to make iteffective and representative. Therefore  Lithuania fullyembraces the idea of ensuring broader representationand responsibility for the Security Council.In addition  the Economic and Social Councilmust be renewed and strengthened. By dedicatingourselves to Economic and Social Council reform wehave a real chance to make it an effective tool in thehands of active and responsible United Nationsmembers.It is my hope and wish that by the end of thissession we shall arrive at marking the sixtiethanniversary of the United Nations with the convictionand satisfaction that we have done everything in ourpower to build a better Organization  one capable ofresponding to both old and new  hard and soft  threatsand challenges in an effective and comprehensive way.Fully aware that the United Nations was createdto serve humankind  let us embrace this challenge. Letus bring to fruition the promise that the United Nationsis capable of fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of thepeoples for whom it was created."
"105",4288,"LUX",59,2004,"It is a special honour for me  as a member of the newGovernment of Luxembourg and its Minister forForeign Affairs and Immigration  to take the floor forthe first time before this gathering of the nations of theworld.You  sir  have acceded to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at a time when decisions fraughtwith consequences for the future of our Organizationmust be prepared and discussed. Our Secretary-Generalhas reminded us that the United Nations is at acrossroads. I have no doubt that  under your skilled andwise leadership  our General Assembly will be ableeffectively and decisively to provide constructive andconsensual responses to the great issues of our time.The session ahead  leading us to thecommemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of theestablishment of the United Nations  must be one ofrenewal for multilateralism. I can assure you  Sir  thatmy country — a founding Member of the UnitedNations — intends to contribute actively to that crucialwork  in particular within the presidency of the Councilof the European Union  to which Luxembourg willaccede on 1 January 2005  following the currentpresidency of the Netherlands. It goes without sayingthat I fully subscribe to the statement made by mycolleague  Mr. Bernard Bot  Minister for ForeignAffairs of the Netherlands  before this Assembly.From this moment until the sixtieth session of theGeneral Assembly  three themes will be the focus ofour attention: issues linked to the maintenance of peaceand security; the complex question of development andits financing; and United Nations reform.We must begin this genuine relaunching ofmultilateral cooperation first of all in the area of themaintenance of peace and security  basing our actionon the United Nations Charter. While regional crisesand civil wars have multiplied in various areas of theglobe  in particular on the African continent over thepast year  history has taught us  often tragically andpainfully  that peace and stability can only bemaintained and guaranteed within the framework of aninternational order based on the rule of law and sharedstrong and effective institutions based on fundamentalshared values. This has been stated in our superbUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and thesubsequent normative instruments that supplemented it.This is also the lesson learned from the fratricidalhorrors and conflicts of the past century betweenmember States of the European Union  which now weare gratified to see expanded to 25 members.In that context  we look with concern toward theMiddle and Near East  where situations of tension andof open conflict seem to be worsening. Regarding theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict  we must emphaticallyrecall here  given a situation characterized bynumerous impasses on all sides  that the path ofnegotiation and compromise remains the onlyreasonable path and that the road map remains the onlyway to achieve a negotiated solution between theparties  based on the coexistence of two States  namely an independent and viable Palestinian State  living inpeace next to Israel  within secure and recognizedborders. This was also vigorously reaffirmed by theQuartet the day before yesterday. In the same way  anywithdrawal by Israel from the Gaza Strip must takeplace within the context of the political processdescribed by the road map.The unanimous adoption of Security Councilresolution 1546 (2004) on the situation in Iraq and thesubsequent restoration of Iraqi sovereignty constitutean important stage in the process of political  socialand economic reconstruction of this battered country.The European Union  for its part  adopted in earlySeptember a set of measures designed to furtherstrengthen the European commitment to Iraq. We hopethat conditions will soon be such that the UnitedNations will be able to fully play its proper role  inparticular regarding the political process  thepreparation for elections  humanitarian assistance andreconstruction.Luxembourg has also been following with thegreatest attention developments in the situation in theGreat Lakes region  the Western Balkans  and  inparticular  in Kosovo  as well as in Darfur in Sudan.My country fully associates itself with the positionspresented here by my Dutch colleague on behalf of theEuropean Union.15The preservation of peace  crisis prevention andmanagement and peacekeeping are among the noblesttasks of our Organization. The Security Council has animportant role to play here. We should not hesitate toconsider innovative solutions in defining newapproaches and institutional processes to strengthenour collective capacity for prevention and action on thebasis of the Charter.Here I would like to welcome the measures takenby the Secretary-General regarding the prevention ofgenocide. I would venture to hope that the High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change will be ableto put before us proposals to both improve our capacityfor shared action and cope with the new threats topeace and security  among which  first and foremost are terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. United Nations instruments in fightingterrorism were recently enhanced by the adoption ofSecurity Council resolution 1535 (2004) and theimplementation measures which flow from it.However  the recent report of the Analytical Supportand Sanctions Monitoring Team of the SecurityCouncil Committee established pursuant to resolution1267 (1999) concerning Al Qaeda and the Taliban andAssociated Individuals and Entities reminded us that agreat deal still remains to be done to put an end tothese despicable and unacceptable practices whichleave so many families throughout the world inmourning.The fight against terrorism cannot be won solelythrough the use of military and police means. We muststrike at its roots  which spawn hate  brutality and thesenseless destruction of human lives. The core of anymultilateral system is the right of all peoples and everyhuman being to live in peace and dignity.The threat of weapons of mass destruction alsoremains a concern of highest priority. While significantprogress has been made  disturbing news has reachedus over the last few months from other regions of theglobe  in particular from Iran and from the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea. In each of these cases  thenecessary clarifications and full guarantees must beprovided  particularly within the framework of strictrespect for the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) regimes. Here  I would like to emphasize thatthe 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must provide anopportunity for reaffirming the validity and relevanceof the shared quest for solutions to the complex issuesof non-proliferation.Regarding all of these cases linked to themaintenance of peace and international security  theUnited Nations will find a reliable and committedpartner in the European Union  which has made theemergence of effective multilateralism one of itspriorities for the security strategy it adopted inDecember 2003. It is  indeed  with pride that I add thatLuxembourg has also been shouldering itspeacekeeping responsibilities by contributing militarycontingents to the Kosovo Force and to theInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan which are now under the command of the EuropeanCorps.The issue of development is and must remain thefocus of the international community’s attention. Thisis the most important point in this context. Whilemillions of human beings continue to live inunacceptable conditions  our rallying around theachievement of the Millennium Development Goalsmust be constant and indeed stepped up  given the factthat many States  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa still experience extreme difficulty in making progressto meet the 2015 deadline.For its part  Luxembourg is ready to shoulder itsduties in the indispensable joint international efforts. In2003  our official development assistance (ODA) inLuxembourg reached 0.81 per cent of our grossnational product and the goal of having this figurereach one per cent in the years to come is part of theprogramme of the new Government that was formed inJuly of this year. The struggle against poverty and thecommitment to sustainable development on the globallevel are also major objectives of the policy ofcooperation in Luxembourg  the policy that we areimplementing together with our partners in a spirit ofpartnership and participation. In our actions to ensurecooperation  particular emphasis must be placed on thecontinuation of international efforts targetingreproductive health  in particular  combating thehorrendous scourge of HIV/AIDS.In addition to an increase in ODA on the globalscale  other sources of financing can be used  and theinitiative of Presidents Lula and Chirac has charted theway for a number of interesting ideas in this respect.We believe that it is critical to maintain the MonterreyConsensus as a whole. Any effective development16strategy in the medium- and long-term must be basedon a proper combination of elements such as ODA international trade  direct foreign investment and thedomestic efforts of the countries involved  particularlyregarding capacity reinforcement  strengthening ofgovernance and the rule of law. In this regard  I amconvinced that all efforts must be further developed toachieve a positive conclusion to the Doha developmentround.As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration I must mention an innovation in our national politicalcontext  as did our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan on 29 January 2004  in an inciteful speech to theEuropean Parliament in Brussels regarding the growingimportance of the problem of migration  particularlyfor Europe. This issue must be addressed through acareful management of migration flows by focusing onintegration and international cooperation. Decisiveaction against organized crime  in particular crimelinked to any kind of trafficking in human beings  is anindispensable corollary to this.We are called upon to step up our efforts duringthe year to come to prepare for a significant event namely  the September 2005 summit  and which  inUnited Nations jargon  is being called the “majorevent”. Five years after the Millennium Summit  thismeeting of the highest political leaders on the planetshould provide an opportunity to define a newsynthesis — a new global agenda — at the dawn of thetwenty-first century.Indeed  we face many significant challenges.Together  we must review all of the commitmentsundertaken in the Millennium Declaration and at themajor conferences of the 1990s  assess theirimplementation and  within the Organization  makeany adjustments and adaptations that a changing globalcontext requires — all without compromising the levelof the shared ambitions that inspire us. We must see toit that the new global agenda expresses the hopes andaspirations of the entire international community. Inparticular  development must continue to be a focus ofthe attention it deserves. There is also a need to openour Organization up to the new debates and the newissues that are emerging in the area of the maintenanceof peace and security.None of the foregoing issues are fiefdoms of aparticular State or group of States. Rather  they areconcerns shared by all Member States and  as such must be managed jointly within the multilateralinstitutions that form our common heritage. Thevitality and relevance of our Organization is the key tothe effort to redefine the terms of the internationalagenda by giving priority to the concepts ofinterdependence and solidarity. While the goals arevital  the risks are significant  and  together  we mustchart a coordinated  inclusive and balanced path thatwill allow each and every one of us to participate fullyand to express our aspirations and expectations.To achieve those lofty goals we need  first of all to promote the development of a new mindset in ourdeliberations. After the divisions and controversies ofrecent years  the international community must onceagain come together and close ranks around shared joint objectives. In that way the United Nations willremain the pre-eminent seat of international legitimacyand a vital centre for multilateral action  as theSecretary-General recently said. It is that new mindsetthat must inspire our shared activities as we movetowards next year’s major event.We also need to agree on a procedure that willensure the participation of all  guarantee the necessarybalance among the various aspects of the process andguide us towards greater coordination on the substanceof the political messages to be formulated. In allevents  rest assured that my country and its partners inthe European Union are ready to participate fully inthat debate.In the context of a renewal of multilateralism  as Ihave tried to outline it here  reform of the UnitedNations has pride of place. Our institutions must bebetter adapted to meet new challenges  as well as tofulfil their present mandates. The genuine renewal ofthe United Nations system must be reflected in apalpable strengthening of the tools for analysis decision and action available to us. Effectivemultilateralism must be expressed through thestrengthening of the United Nations system as a whole.By adopting a more global approach  we seereform not as a zero-sum game  but as a positive-sumgame  in which each player and each institutionbenefits from the new impetus thus provided.Significant progress was already made in therevitalization of the General Assembly during the fifty-eighth session  under the leadership of the formerPresident  Mr. Julian Hunte. Those efforts now remain17to be translated into action as well as continued andintensified.Security Council reform  which has been indiscussion for more than a decade  must be carried out so that that vital body can better reflect the realities oftoday’s world; indeed  it is both a prerequisite for theCouncil’s legitimacy and a guarantee for theeffectiveness of its action. More active interactionbetween the Security Council and the GeneralAssembly and a better coordination of their roles  aswell as enhanced transparency regarding States notmembers of the Security Council  should form theframework of any future enlargement of the Council.The restructuring of the work of the Economicand Social Council and the Main Committees of theGeneral Assembly should be conducted withdetermination and courage so that more focused andbetter organized activities can gain greater relevanceand have greater political impact on the substantiveproblems being addressed.The strengthening of the rule of law on a globalscale  as called for by the Secretary-General  and  inparticular  the consolidation and ultimateuniversalization of the International Criminal Court should be among our highest priorities  along with theprotection of human rights — the vital importance ofwhich I would like to emphasize once again.Finally  I would be remiss were I to fail tomention the Secretariat staff and other United Nationspersonnel  who are carrying out an extraordinarilydifficult mission with courage and dedication  andindeed sometimes  as we know  risking their very lives.It is crucial that we be able  within the framework ofthis year’s budgetary discussions for the year  toprovide the Organization with the resources particularly the financial resources to fulfil themandates that we have conferred upon it  especially inregard to peacekeeping operations. It is also vital thatthe Organization adopt a rigorous policy regarding theprotection of United Nations personnel  who are actingon our behalf in often dangerous conditions in allcorners of the globe.It seems that to put a curse on someone  one hasonly to wish for them to live in interesting times. I donot know if we are living under a curse  but I do knowthat we are living in an interesting time: a time ofdebate  a time of restructuring  a time of choice and ofthe relaunching of international cooperation. Let usseize this opportunity and breathe new life into theUnited Nations  which has been proven itself to beindispensable. But let us also admit that the choice ofmultilateralism is a demanding one  and one thatrequires of us all an increased readiness to call intoquestion our old certainties and to accept newapproaches within a renewed institutional framework.On the path towards that renewal  let us drawinspiration from the magnificent lines of the Spanishpoet  Antonio Machado  and I quote:“Traveller  your footstepsAre the road  and nothing else;Traveller  there is no road.The road is made by walking;Walking makes the road”.I am confident that together we will have thevision and the courage to take that first step  and thesteps that follow  on that ambitious path."
"106",4314,"LVA",59,2004,"I wish I could beginthis address on a more optimistic note  but since welast convened at the General Assembly one year ago many dramatic and disconcerting events have occurredon the world stage. I refer in particular to theindiscriminate and brutal terrorist attacks on civiliansall over the world: in Russia  Spain  Iraq  Israel  SaudiArabia  Indonesia and many other countries. I refer tothe targeting of children and their parents at schools on buses and on aeroplanes. I refer to the almost dailybomb blasts on busy city streets  in marketplaces andin residential apartment buildings. I refer to the sadisticpride and relish with which terrorists have been filmingthe shooting  throat-slashing and decapitation of theirvictims.The purposeful torture and killing of civilians isone of the basest forms of human barbarity. It is acrime against humanity  along with ethnic cleansingand genocide. Unfortunately  terrorism is notdisappearing from the news headlines of the twenty-first century. Instead  it is becoming the principalmethod of warfare used by disaffected groups seekingto achieve their political ends and to blackmail nationalGovernments. Nothing can justify the use of suchmeans. Any seemingly noble ends can only bediscredited by using terrorism to further them.Frequently  countries facing terrorist attacks havebeen using vastly superior military capabilities to strikehard at real or perceived terrorist targets. Too often however  those strikes have had an undesirable sideeffect of their own: the further wounding and killing ofcivilians and the additional destruction of property.Such strikes have done nothing to diminish the deep-seated feelings of resentment of disaffectedpopulations. The events of the past few years  andindeed of the past few decades  point to the stark andsobering reality that the military option alone has notbeen effective in rooting out terrorism and thatterrorism has not been an effective means for achievingpolitical aspirations and goals.Such never-ending cycles of killing and mountingmutual hostility will cease once and for all only whenthe parties involved forsake the use of violence. In theMiddle East  Latvia views the road map for peace asthe only feasible means of obtaining a cessation ofhostilities between Israelis and Palestinians. Mycountry encourages the interested parties to do theirutmost to de-escalate tensions and resume the peaceprocess.In Iraq  the United States-led coalition forceshave handed over power to an interim Government  butsecurity problems are hampering the reconstruction ofthe country and threaten the viability of free and fairelections this coming January. The transition in Iraqwill require continued international assistance  and Iencourage the United Nations to assume an active rolein that regard.Afghanistan is due to experience its first everelections next month. Latvia hopes that the historicevent will not be derailed by violent attempts to disruptthe democratic process in that country. Latvia is readyto continue supporting international efforts to providepeace and security in both Afghanistan and Iraq.Ten years after the human catastrophe in Rwanda we are again confronted with the systematic rape torture and killing of civilians  in the Darfur region ofthe Sudan. Those crimes have occurred on such a widescale that they might be classifiable as ethnic cleansingand genocide. Latvia welcomes the mediation efforts ofthe African Union and encourages all parties involvedto ensure that no further harm comes to the civilians ofthe region. My country supports Security Councilresolution 1564 (2004) of 18 September  which urgesthe Sudanese Government to act decisively to stop theviolence.The United Nations faces the prospect ofestablishing a new peacekeeping mission in Sudan  inaddition to the 17 field operations already on theground. During the past few months alone  two newMissions were established  in Burundi and Haiti  whilea third was expanded in CÙte díIvoire. The UnitedNations peacekeeping budget for next year may nearlydouble as a result.Latvia is deeply committed to the United Nationsand to effective multilateralism as a central element ofUnited Nations activities. Latvia believes that theUnited Nations must maintain its crucial role in themediation of international disputes and that Member24States must summon the collective political will tosupport the United Nations as a truly credible force forpeace.The Security Council has been the principalforum in which the countries of the world deliberatetogether on matters of peace and security. Latviabelieves that the Open-ended Working Group onSecurity Council Reform must continue its activitiesand come forth with proposals on how to make theCouncil more representative of todayís political andeconomic realities  how to provide the Council withgreater legitimacy and how to render it more effective.A serious debate should be continued regarding theenlargement of the number of permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council. Countriessuch as Japan or Germany can and should play anincreasingly stronger role in this framework in view oftheir substantial contribution to United Nationsactivities and commitments.Proposals for enhancing coordination between theGeneral Assembly  the Economic and Social Counciland the Security Council have made little progress.Overlapping mandates and the duplication of effortscontinue to reduce the efficiency of the United Nations.The economic and social programmes of the UnitedNations need to be reformed  as well. For example why are the issues of the Economic and Social Councilreviewed four times a year  when twice a year might besufficient? Combined with the restructuring of theEconomic and Social Council's functionalcommissions  such a reduction of redundancy in thereview process could free up vital financial and humanresources for important economic and socialdevelopment programmes in the developing countriesthat need them most.Latvia recognizes the important role of the UnitedNations and other international organizations inpromoting worldwide development and reducingpoverty. Having regained its independence only 13years ago  Latvia is gradually completing the transitionfrom a receiving to a donor country. We are grateful forthe valuable assistance that the United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) has provided to ourcountry since 1993  and we are pleased that UNDP hasextended its mandate until the end of 2005. Althoughthe amount that Latvia is contributing to worldwidedevelopment assistance is not very large at themoment  we are committed to allocating no less thanone third of 1 per cent of our gross national product todevelopment assistance by 2006  as required of all theEuropean Union's member States.Latviaís priority areas for developmentcooperation centre around the promotion of democraticand civil societies  economic development environmental protection and other issues in thecountries neighbouring the European Union particularly Belarus  Georgia  Moldova  Russia Ukraine and Uzbekistan  to name some of the countriesto which Latvia has already provided bilateral technicalassistance.Latvia is eager to reduce the divides between thedeveloped and the developing world. The industrialsociety into which we were born has beencharacterized by the heavy machinery and tools thathave marked human progress over the last twocenturies. Now this society is evolving into aninformation and knowledge society  with innovation asan important engine of growth. Latvia has beenactively involved in the United Nations World Summiton the Information Society (WSIS) and considers it anhonor to chair the Preparatory Committee of thesecond phase of the Summit  which will take place inTunis in November 2005. The WSIS process should bean integral part of the international community’s effortsto eradicate poverty as outlined in the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  which will be reviewedperiodically until 2015.Although the delegations here today come frommany different backgrounds  practice different faithsand speak different languages  all of us in this roomshare the same desire to make our world a better cleaner  more peaceful and more prosperous place tolive in. We share a world view on what it means to be ahuman and on the inherent value of each human life.The more we strive to enshrine such values astolerance  compassion and mutual respect  the morehuman and the more humane our societies will become."
"107",4361,"MAR",59,2004,"I wouldlike to congratulate you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession. This election is a tribute to Africa and to thebrotherly State of Gabon. I am sure that you will carryon the commendable work initiated by yourpredecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  with a view torevitalizing the role played by the United Nations andto enhancing its prestige.I should also like to pay tribute to Mr. KofiAnnan  the Secretary-General  for his untiring effortsto achieve the objectives of our Organization. I want toassure him  once again  of our trust in him and of ourfull support.The world today is faced with major risks andperils of such magnitude that a renewed multilateralsystem is required. In that regard  we must askourselves if the United Nations system  in its presentform  is capable of providing effective solutions to thenumerous problems that are disrupting the internationalorder.The end of the cold war  along with progress inscience and technology and the opening of markets should have led to greater security and prosperity  but instead  the world is still encountering distressingconflicts  which cause considerable human andmaterial loss  to the detriment of development. Humanvalues and ideals are on the decline  while fanaticism extremism and terrorism are on the rise. The gapbetween a rich North and a poor South is widening.It is Africa that suffers the most from thescourges of poverty  hunger  desertification and deadlyepidemics  in addition to the problems of illegalimmigration  refugees and forced displacement. Thecountries of the South cannot effectively cope withthese scourges on their own without successfulregional and international coordination  as well aseffective support for local development efforts.These problems  and their pernicious impact which is compounded by ethnic strife as well as byregional tensions and conflicts  not only cause terriblesuffering but also hamper progress  development regional integration and the transition towardsdemocracy. The international community is thereforecalled upon to pool its efforts so that the logic ofdialogue and negotiation may prevail over that offorce  destruction and war. It must give fresh impetusto preventive diplomacy  at the regional andinternational levels  in order to preserve peace andsecurity on our continent.In that regard  Morocco considers that theartificial dispute over the Sahara is  regrettably  stillhindering the establishment of the Arab MaghrebUnion. I should like to reiterate my countryís readinessto cooperate in a sincere and determined way with theUnited Nations and all the parties concerned in order toachieve  within the framework of international legality a final  negotiated political solution that wouldguarantee the sovereignty  national unity and territorialintegrity of the Kingdom of Morocco  and enable theinhabitants of its southern provinces to manage theirregional affairs by themselves  in a democratic  stableenvironment conducive to integrated development.Such a solution would spare the area the risk ofbecoming a hotbed of tension. It would also fosterMaghreb integration and enable the region fully to playits role in the Mediterranean and in its relations withAfrican countries of the Sahel  thereby sparing thewhole of north-west Africa the risk of Balkanizationand the threats of international terrorism.As an active member of the African family and ofthe international community  the Kingdom of Moroccois keen to continue cooperating with the UnitedNations and the world community to settle disputesthrough peaceful means  volunteering to participate inUnited Nations peacekeeping missions  as is currentlythe case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo andin CÙte díIvoire. Morocco is also eager to help bringabout reconciliation and the settlement of disputesthrough peaceful means  as illustrated by the mediationundertaken by my country to resolve the crisis in theMano River region.Morocco takes pride in contributing to Africanendeavours designed to meet the challenge ofachieving peace  development  progress and goodgovernance ó the very objectives of the NewPartnership for Africaís Development. Since theaccomplishment of those ambitious goals exceeds thecapabilities of African countries and requiresconsiderable resources  I urge the internationalcommunity to support this initiative and to findgenerous and effective solutions to the debt problem.Morocco has already taken steps in that direction.As far as the Arab-Israeli conflict is concerned my country is as determined as ever to work with theinternational community to find a just  comprehensive23and lasting solution within the framework ofinternational legality - a solution that guaranteesIsraelís withdrawal from all occupied Arab territoriesand the establishment of a viable  independentPalestinian State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital living side by side  in peace and concord  with theState of Israel.I should like to stress that  as Chairman of theAl-Quds Committee  I am always ready to undertakewhatever initiatives are needed and to supportmeaningful endeavours to restore peace to this region warning anew of the negative implications of theviolation of religious sanctities.Morocco hopes that no effort will be spared tohelp brotherly Iraq out of its current predicament andto support its Interim Government in its efforts toensure stability and security for Iraqis and to create theright conditions to initiate constructive dialogue andorganize elections which will enable all components ofthe Iraqi population to choose their institutions freelyand peacefully.In order to meet the challenges at this turningpoint in history  the international community has noalternative but to revitalize the current multilateralsystem.After the First and Second World Wars  nationsrealized that it was necessary to establish a globalsystem to govern international relations  within theframework of law and legality. Setting up analternative global system would not resolve theproblem of the fierce trade wars currently ragingworldwide  nor the ethnic conflicts  ideologicalfanaticism and perils of terrorism  whether latent orapparent. I am convinced that the United Nations which has helped solve countless crises  is perfectlycapable of managing the current international situationin a peaceful and civilized way  by revitalizing themultilateral system.Such an objective  however  can be achieved onlyif the United Nations is provided with the kind ofresources and means needed to meet the geo-strategicrequirements of the twenty-first century  and if itsworking methods and its organs ó including theSecurity Council ó are reformed and invigorated. TheUnited Nations system would then become an idealforum for negotiation and interaction between culturesand religions. Furthermore  it would be effectivelyinstrumental in upholding human ideals  enhancingsecurity and stability and promoting sustainabledevelopment.Morocco  through its chairmanship of the Groupof 77 and China and its participation in variousregional and international events  including the Doha Monterrey and Johannesburg conferences  has soughtto contribute effectively to building this multilateralsystem  as a top priority on its diplomatic agenda. Mycountry will continue to work for the implementationof the Millennium Goals  urging countries as well asinternational financial and trade institutions to honourtheir obligations. Morocco reaffirms its commitment tosupport the emergence of a new multilateral systembuilt on international legality  justice and equity andcooperation in social and economic relations  andbased on an efficient and dynamic United Nationssystem.This is the course of action to be taken to enhancetrust in the United Nations as the conscience ofhumankind and the bedrock of a new world order where the values of peace  global security  jointdevelopment  equality  tolerance  democracy andsolidarity prevail."
"108",4385,"MCO",59,2004,"It is with great pleasure that I congratulateyou  Sir  on your unanimous election to preside overthe fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly  anelection that offers Africa its tenth presidency. TheGabonese Republic thus has received from theinternational community the recognition it deservesand the French-speaking countries are delighted to seeone of our own guiding our debates. Be assured thatthe delegation of Monaco  which I am leading  willfully support you in your noble mission in the serviceof peace and development. I would also like to hail theSecretary-General for his courage and his unwaveringcommitment to peace.A long time ago  the Organization began aprocess of thinking through the reforms that arerequired to improve its functioning. In that connection I would like to congratulate the outgoing President ofthe Assembly  Mr. Julian Hunte  on his work during thefifty-eighth session; his perseverance made possiblethe adoption of new measures to revitalize the work ofthe General Assembly. While welcoming that progress we know that we must continue along that path.Dedication to democracy and to the rule of law unswerving confidence in the virtues of multilateralismand respect for our differences allow us to moveforward in a spirit of harmony and to continue to adaptthe Organization to meet the challenges of our time. Itis vital that the Organization be provided with themeans to better respond to the expectations of thepeoples of the world.This is why the Principality supports initiativesaimed at improving the Organizationís methods ofwork and  in particular  those regarding SecurityCouncil reform. Enlargement of the Council  in bothpermanent and non-permanent seats  will strengthen itscapacity to contribute to the essential objectives of themaintenance of peace by providing more equitablerepresentation of the diverse regions that compose theinternational community.The fifteenth International AIDS Conference held in Thailand last July  once again highlighted thedevastation caused by this terrible pandemic as well asits disastrous social consequences. However  theConference also demonstrated that when internationalorganizations  Governments and civil society agree towork together  we can fight this scourge moreeffectively. In that struggle  the role of women iscrucial. In my country  Her Serene Highness PrincessStephanie  my sister  created and chairs the Fight AIDSMonaco association that gives moral and materialsupport to AIDS patients and their families whilepromoting information and prevention programmes.For my part  I have expressed the wish that all ofthe Principality's school children participate in marking a23world day for children orphaned by AIDS  to showtheir solidarity with these vulnerable children whosenumber could reach 100 million by the year 2010.Once again this year  my country has beencontributing to the Global Fund to fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria  which was created followingthe twenty-sixth special session of the GeneralAssembly  the first to be devoted to a disease. We havebeen providing regular support for the activities of theJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS) since its creation  and I am pleased toannounce that the Principality has decided tostrengthen its financial cooperation with theProgramme. We hope that the creation within UNAIDSof the Programme Acceleration Fund will allow us tomeet specific needs defined by the recipient Statesthemselves. In effect  we are convinced of the necessityfor States to strengthen  on the one hand  theircapacities in terms of basic social services andadequate sanitation facilities and on the other hand  topursue public awareness and information campaigns.Upon the initiative of His Serene Highness theSovereign Prince  my father  the Principality ofMonaco has always expressed its solidarity to the mostunderdeveloped populations. We share the concerns ofworld leaders regarding the adverse impact that thepersistence of extreme poverty is having oninternational security.We shall therefore consider most carefully theelaboration of a new global partnership designed toeliminate hunger and poverty and to advance economicdevelopment and social justice  as a continuation to thecommitments undertaken at the Millennium Summitand during the Monterrey Conference.Terrorism  unfortunately  has become a dailyreality  as is attested to by  among others  the tragedythat took place in Beslan  which is repugnant to all ofus. Our determination to fight it must remain unshakenand that is why we welcome the establishment of anexecutive directorate of the Counter-TerrorismCommittee. In that domain  international cooperation isan essential element for effective action. No State regardless of its size  can be a weak link that mightendanger the efforts we are conducting together.Therefore  the Principality intends to play its rolein the battle which our Organization is waging againstterrorism. Thus  Monaco has become a party to all of thetwelve conventions designed to eradicate internationalterrorism and has adopted  as domestic legislation appropriate measures for their implementation.But the battle against terrorism also requires thatwe act irreproachably in terms of our respect forhuman rights. Accordingly  the Principality is makingevery effort to guarantee them on its territory; henceMonacoís forthcoming accession to the Convention onthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen.The number of refugees and displaced personswho are displaced within their own countries continuesto increase  and our response to the unbearablesuffering of those human beings cannot be limited toour moral indignation. As in any urgent and complexemergency situation  civilians and the most vulnerableamong them are the targets of harm and the worst typesof abuse. The humanitarian disaster which continues totake place under our very eyes in Darfur has shown once again  how limited we are in our capacity toenforce respect for human rights and for internationalhumanitarian law.In response to the appeal launched by the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees (UNHCR) during the special session of theGeneral Assembly on children in 2002  the authoritiesof Monaco decided to earmark their traditionalcontribution to UNHCR towards primary education forrefugee children. We hope to provide those children whose world has been brutally shattered overnight  asubstitute for their traditional educational environment by allowing them to escape  albeit a little  those terribleconditions of daily life dominated by promiscuity andthe anguish of having forever lost their homes.Championing the interests of the child has alwaysbeen one of our major concerns. To build a world fitfor children  in keeping with the commitmentsundertaken during the May 2002 special session onchildren  the World Association of Childrenís Friends presided over by my sister  Her Royal Highness thePrincess of Hanover  organized in the Principality inApril 2003  a round table on that subject.Unfortunately  the need is becoming clearer each day to strengthen the area of international law designed toguarantee the rights of children and to assure that thoselaws are more effectively applied.Thus  do not those particularly heinous crimesrequire an exceptionally strong response? Do we notneed to ensure that the most serious violations of the24rights of children do not fall under a statute oflimitations and do we not need to extend the powers ofthe national jurisdictions by providing them withuniversal competence in that area?The Principality of Monaco urges you to givethought to this  in other words  to plan for the adoptionof a legal instrument which will make it possible here to react against the impunity which continues toprevail  concerning the enrolment of child soldiers  thesexual exploitation of children and the despicable tradeof which they are victims - to mention only the mostrevolting of those crimes.The debate held last June in the Security Councilserved to reaffirm the timely nature of suchconsiderations. By abolishing the statute of limitationsfor those horrendous crimes  we would bestrengthening their prevention  as well as fulfilling ourduty to honour the memory of the victims. Byexpanding the competences of our nationaljurisdictions so that borders no longer serve to limitour actions  we will be better able to cope with thedevelopment of the transnational organized crimenetwork which defies our States and the legal orderthey are trying to establish.I am fully aware that this essentially moralstruggle - to ensure respect for the rights of thechild - gives rise  given the present state ofinternational law  to numerous legal difficulties. But isit not our duty to act when that legislation is no longeradapted to meet the challenges of our time  at a timewhen the international community is clearly closing itsunified ranks  to put an end to those practices whichare abhorrent to all of us?Let us be courageous and foresighted inchampioning the most noble cause that exists - thedefence of innocents. Let us respond to the appeal ofAlbert Einstein made so long ago that - there will beno progress in this world as long as there are unhappychildren."
"109",4410,"MDA",59,2004,"At theoutset  I would like to say that I feel very honoured andprivileged to participate for the first time in the workof the General Assembly and to represent the Republicof Moldova at this rostrum.On behalf of the Moldovan delegation  I wish tocongratulate you  Mr. President  on your well deservedelection. I am confident that your vast experience anddiplomatic skills will help the Assembly at the currentsession to fulfil its important tasks.I join other speakers in expressing our gratitudeto your predecessor  Mr. Julian Robert Hunte  for thededicated and effective manner in which he guided thework of the previous session.This has indeed been a difficult year for theOrganization  with serious crises occurring in variousparts of the world. Increasingly  the internationalcommunity is faced with conflicts within States  thepainful manifestations of which have been seen inconflicts in the Middle East  Africa  the NorthCaucasus and elsewhere.We are all preoccupied by the implications andconsequences of the crisis in Iraq. The Republic ofMoldova considers that the United Nations should beengaged in a more consistent way in helping thatcountry to stabilize its internal situation and to embarkon the path towards recovery  development anddemocracy.Earlier  in Spain and Turkey and  most recently in the Russian Federation  we have seen howterrorism — the scourge of the twenty-first century —indiscriminately strikes the innocent  includingchildren. We strongly believe that terrorist acts must beconsidered crimes against humanity. The Republic ofMoldova strongly condemns all terrorist acts  forwhich there can be no excuse or justification. We payhomage to the victims of that violence.Precisely due to the challenges faced  theRepublic of Moldova fully supports the ongoing reformprocess of the United Nations system. A key aspect ofthat process is the reform of the Security Council. Toooften  that principal organ has been accused of failuresin the maintenance of international peace and security.It is therefore essential to make it more efficient in thedischarge of its primary responsibility. In our view  theefficiency of the Security Council can be achieved byimproving its representativeness  legitimacy transparency and accountability and by restricting theright of veto to issues of substance  as provided for bythe United Nations Charter.The Republic of Moldova shares the view that thereform of the United Nations system will be successfulonly if the reform of the Security Council is followedby the reform of the General Assembly and theEconomic and Social Council. We support themomentum created for revitalizing the Assembly andstrengthening the coordinating functions of theEconomic and Social Council in the social andeconomic fields. Effective coordination among thethree main bodies is essential if we want to addresscomprehensively the urgent problems of today’s world.In the new circumstances  the United Nationsshould continue to improve its capacity in the field ofpeacekeeping  which is an important instrument for themaintenance of international peace and security. Wesupport actions aimed at enhancing the United Nationsrapid deployment capabilities through its standbyarrangements. I would like to mention that Moldovahas committed itself to contribute troops to the UnitedNations Standby Arrangements System throughyesterday’s signing at the Department of PeacekeepingOperations of a formal document in that regard. TheRepublic of Moldova is already present in UnitedNations peacekeeping efforts  with military observersand staff officers in United Nations missions in Liberiaand Côte d’Ivoire. We are determined to continue tosupport United Nations activities in this area.It is crucial to further strengthen the UnitedNations anti-terrorist legal framework. The Republic ofMoldova fully supports the current efforts to concludea convention for the suppression of acts of nuclearterrorism and a comprehensive internationalconvention on international terrorism.I would like to commend the Secretary-Generalfor his many initiatives to make the Organization moreeffective. The creation of the High-level Panel onThreats  Challenges and Change is another importantstep in that direction. Like other Member States  theRepublic of Moldova looks forward to concreterecommendations from the Panel on how to tackle13contemporary threats  including new ones such asintra-State conflicts  terrorism and separatism.We cannot realistically expect to win the waragainst international terrorism as long as regional andinternal conflicts remain unsolved and their root causesnot properly addressed. Recently  terrorism hasincreasingly been merging with separatism. Manyterrorists and international criminals have found a safehaven in the regions affected by internal conflicts andsecessionist tendencies.In this context  I would like to add my voice tothose who have repeatedly warned in recent years ofthe danger posed by aggressive separatism. Separatismprovides fertile ground for various extremist forces andterrorist groups. It has become one of the main sourcesof internal conflicts and regional instability. To ignoreit would have tragic consequences for numerouscountries of a multi-ethnic composition.Regretfully  separatism continues to be the mainobstacle to consolidating the independence andstatehood of the Republic of Moldova. Over the years the Republic of Moldova has systematically informedthe relevant international organizations of the dangerthat the political conflict in its eastern region poses toregional and international peace and security. Thesettlement of the conflict has become the country’sabsolute priority. The initiatives put forward by theRepublic of Moldova in recent years reflect thedetermination and political will of Moldovanauthorities to resolve this political conflict peacefully on the basis of respect for the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of the country. In particular  I wouldlike to underline the initiative of the President of theRepublic of Moldova  Mr. Vladimir Voronin  on theestablishment of the Joint Constitutional Commissioncharged with drafting a new constitution.Despite the constructive approach by Moldovanauthorities in their dialogue with the self-appointedTransdniestrian leaders and other participants in themultilateral framework of negotiations  developmentshave demonstrated the inefficiency of thesenegotiations. It has also become obvious that theseparatist leaders do not sincerely wish for thecountry’s reintegration. In this regard  I shouldmention  among other things  the recent closure ofMoldovan schools that use Latin script  the inhumanetreatment of children and ethnic discrimination.This region remains an area rife with the illegalmanufacture and traffick of arms. Given the porousnessof the Transdniestrian section of the Moldovan-Ukrainian border  there are no guarantees that theillegally manufactured or trafficked armaments will notreach other conflicts zones in the future.We are also deeply concerned about the humanrights situation in the area controlled by separatistforces. The separatist regime has systematicallyviolated most human rights  including the right ofassociation  the right to a fair trial  freedom fromtorture  freedom of movement and  especially  the rightto education. All of these human rights violationshinder the democratization process within the region.At the same time  we have encountered a biasedattitude on the part of the involved parties  reflected inthe support for smuggling and in the obvious violationsof existing bilateral and international agreements. Wedeem it necessary to modify the components of thepeacekeeping mechanism and to replace it with a newone under an international mandate.Considering that the interests of regional stabilityand security require an objective and impartialapproach  it is necessary to ensure full respect forinternational law and democratic standards. Moreimportantly  any geopolitical and geo-economicinterest in maintaining the status-quo needs to beabandoned. Strict implementation of the decisionstaken at the 1999 Istanbul Summit of the Organizationfor Security and Cooperation in Europe wouldharmoniously fit such an approach.Also  as has already been mentioned during thecurrent debate  we must exclude the practice ofapplying double standards when dealing with internalconflicts and the means for their settlement.The reintegration of the country andconsolidation of democratic values within its entireterritory are essential conditions for the Europeanintegration of the Republic of Moldova. It is in thiscontext that the President of the Republic of Moldovahas launched an initiative on a stability and securitypact for Moldova. This document is aimed at ensuringconsensus among the parties concerned  in order toguarantee the development of an independent sovereign and integral Moldovan State. We believe thatholding an international conference on this issueshould be the next step in initiating the debate on themeasures to follow. This situation demonstrates theinternational character of the problem  as well as theinefficiency of existing regional settlementmechanisms.14Today  the main challenges for the UnitedNations in the economic  social and related fields stemfrom world trends  such as globalization and increasingecological interdependence  and from persistent factorssuch as widespread poverty and severe socialinequalities between and within States. They should beaddressed by a strengthened global partnershipbetween industrialized countries  developing countries countries with transitional economies andintergovernmental institutions.The Millennium Development Goals remain themost significant objectives agreed to by theinternational community  as they cover the areas ofmajor concern for the peoples of the world. It istherefore of utmost importance to achieve the Goals  aswell as other specific developmental targets setsubsequently by several major United Nationsconferences in the economic and social fields. In thiscontext  we welcome the decision of the GeneralAssembly  adopted at its last session  to hold inSeptember 2005 a high-level meeting that willundertake a comprehensive review of the progressmade in the implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration  including the Millennium DevelopmentGoals  as well as a review of the integrated andcoordinated implementation of the outcomes of themajor United Nations conferences and summits.This review is necessary  given the overall slowpace of implementation. We share the concernsexpressed in this respect by many States  in particularby the countries sponsoring the world leaders’ NewYork Declaration on the Action against Hunger andPoverty  which was adopted on 20 September. Likethem  we believe that if resolute and urgent action isnot taken  the Millennium Development Goals will notbe reached by 2015 in some regions of the world.We should not forget  in this context  about thegrave social and economic problems that affect crisis-stricken countries and countries with special needs  inparticular landlocked countries. Creating an enablingenvironment for sustainable development is a challengefor them and  therefore  they should be further assistedby the United Nations system and the donorcommunity.I would like to reiterate  in conclusion  mycountry’s commitment to the Organization and itswillingness to cooperate with other Member States inorder to achieve the noble goals and principlesenshrined in the United Nations Charter."
"110",4454,"MDG",59,2004,"More than ever  Africa is making headlines in theinternational community. Unfortunately  it is moreabout crises  wars and problems of failing States thatare attracting the worldís attention. Yet  some positiveaspects do exist.African countries are resolutely taking theirdestiny into their own hands. Good governance is nolonger an empty word. Democracies are developingand taking root. The fight against corruption isseriously under way. In many States on the continent there is a strong willingness for peace  security andstability  as well as better conditions for development.African countries are deciding to unite in order tostrengthen their abilities. The African Union  the NewPartnership for Africaís Development (NEPAD)  theCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  theSouthern African Economic Community  as well asother organizations  are becoming more and moreefficient in resolving conflicts on the Africancontinent. They are gradually gaining the respect oftheir partners from Europe  America and Asia.For its part  Madagascar has successfullyundertaken major reforms in order to ensure stabledemocracy and good governance  to establish a trustfulpolicy  to protect freedom of the press  to decentralizeand evolve the administrationís functions andresponsibilities and  lastly  to encourage internationalinvestment.Madagascar is seeking to play an active andefficient role in African and internationalorganizations. We strongly support the strengthening ofthe United Nations. We endorse the enlargement of themembership of the Security Council in order to have abetter balance between developed and developingcountries. It is high time for Africa to obtain apermanent seat  and this is also the case for Germany Brazil  India and Japan  which are major contributorsto the United Nations.Madagascar supports any effort to promote peace democracy and the rule of law in Africa. We aredevoted to good governance  respect for human rightsand the fight against terrorism in Madagascar andelsewhere in Africa. Recent examples attest to our firmpolitical will  including Madagascarís strong supportfor the declaration for free elections  signed in PortLouis; its participation in the Moroni Agreement to re-establish peace in the Comoros; and its signing of theagreement on human rights in Geneva.Madagascar has made great progress  which hasbeen recognized by international institutions and themajor Powers. Economic and political development hasbecome a reality in our country. However  we are alsothreatened by natural disasters  such as cyclones  as10well as by the rise in oil prices  by the debt burden andby the lack of access to the markets of industrializedcountries. We are concerned by the slowimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Actionadopted by the international community in 2001. Weneed more foreign investment on our continent  both inthe public and private sector.I urge the Assembly to assume moreresponsibility for a just and fair world and urgeMembers to assume more responsibility for Africa.Africa is ready to take its destiny into its own hands.We are aware of our own responsibilities; however  wemust share them. The globalization of the economymust go hand in hand with the globalization ofresponsibilities.We know of success stories relating to this kindof responsibility. Nevertheless  we have experiencedsome cases  mainly in Africa  where the world hasfailed in its responsibilities with resulting tragicrepercussions. Let us look at the African continent. Donot forget the catastrophes of the past nor overlook thecatastrophes of the present. But  above all  consider thepotential of our future. How will Africa look in 10 or20 years? Can we imagine this?Africa can become a flourishing continent; it hasenormous potential  which may be the source ofprosperity for both Africans and the world. First of all it has human potential. More than half of the Africanpeople are under the age of 25. Todayís young Africansare more open and more dynamic. They can narrow thegap between the past and the challenges of today. Theydeserve a better education and professional trainingthat is suited to the needs of the market. Education-for-all programmes are vital. Investing in education ismore profitable than any other investment in povertyreduction. Africanís destiny will depend on theeducation of our young people.Women in Madagascar are sometimes morepersistent than men. They deserve more than theirtraditional role within the family. Let us give them thechance to fulfil themselves  to enjoy the same rights asmen. All of us will benefit from their wisdom anddedication.I would now like to speak about agriculturalpotential. In Madagascar  more than half of the arableland is still unexploited. We can double or triple theproductivity rate. Let us help farmers to organizethemselves  to use better seeds and modern irrigationsystems and to obtain easier access to fertilizers. Let usset up infrastructures to develop markets. Let ussimplify land registration. Let us institute appropriatefinancial systems to encourage farmers to becomeentrepreneurs. Let us set up infrastructure and systemsfor the processing of natural products. Let us buildfood processing units and undertake related activities.Let us extend the food chain. Let us develop foodprocessing networks in rural areas. The greenrevolution that the Secretary-General spoke aboutrecently is not a dream.Next  I wish to speak about economic potential.Development at the base  sustained by internationalinvestment  will generate high economic growth.Madagascar experienced economic growth of 9.6 percent in 2003  and we hope to achieve the sameperformance in 2004 and 2005. This is also possiblefor other African countries. With such a high economicgrowth rate and more than 900 million consumers  theAfrican market will become increasingly worthwhile.As to energy  we are all aware of the fact that theworld energy situation is critical and affects not justour economies but our ecology as well. What potentialexists in Africa? Half of the African countries  likeMadagascar  could produce an abundant supply ofhydraulic energy; only 7 per cent of this potential isexploited; only 1 per cent of the worldís solar energycomes from Africa. Let us conclude an agreement onenergy development in Africa. The potential lies inreforestation and in the Kyoto process.Then  there is ecological potential. In addition tothe energy and the climate  we can share the values ofour nature with the world. Seventy per cent ofMadagascarís plants and fauna are endemic. Atpresent  we cannot truly assess the extent to which theywill be of benefit for medicine  as well as in otherfields.With all this potential  the development of Africais in the interest of the great Powers. Their leadersshould know what African development can offer toworld prosperity  peace and security. Africa is acontinent of the future. Africa can become aflourishing continent. Let us seek a common vision andfind new approaches to develop Africa.Africa is ready for a new future. We Africans areready to resolve armed conflicts. We are ready to winthe war against poverty and other diseases. We areready for enhanced democracy and good governance.11We are ready to work and cooperate closely for peace stability and security. We are ready for an open marketsystem. We are ready to strengthen our abilities. We areready for competition. We are ready for newleadership. We are ready for a new Africa.That is why we ask for international rules that areacceptable to and accepted by all countries  be theylarge or small. We are asking for mutual respect. Weare asking for closer cooperation.We are asking for a comprehensive plan for thedevelopment of Africa. We are asking for a ìMarshallPlanî for Africa: a plan that should be based on theNEPAD objectives; a plan that includes the EvianSummit objectives and measures  adopted by theGroup of Eight  but that goes even further; a plan thatis more than just an emergency measure; anappropriate plan that promotes all the assets - theentire potential - of Africa. Let us act at once andwithout delay to implement it.Let us promote the potential of Africa. Theimpact for African people and for the internationalcommunity will be enormous."
"111",4493,"MDV",59,2004,"First  let me extend toyou  Mr. President  my delegation’s warmestcongratulations on your election to preside over theAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. My delegation hasevery confidence in your sagacity to guide this sessionand its deliberations to a fruitful conclusion.It is also my pleasure to pay tribute to yourpredecessor  Mr. Julian Robert Hunte  for thecommendable manner in which he discharged hisresponsibilities as the President at the fifty-eighthsession.As well  I wish to take this opportunity tocompliment the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  onhis diligence in promoting peace and pursuing thenoble principles of this Organization. My delegationsincerely wishes him every success in his dauntingtask.The unfolding international events bring to thefore the question of multilateralism and the vital rolethe United Nations has to play in addressing globalcrises and problems and in promoting a world orderbased on the rule of law and the collectiveresponsibility of all nations and communities.The global challenges that we face today arenumerous. While goals are set and programmeslaunched for eradicating poverty  achieving universalprimary education  promoting gender equality reducing child mortality  fighting HIV/AIDS andprotecting the environment  hundreds of innocent livesare lost every day as a result of conflict and civil war.Terrorism has not been defeated. On the contrary it is re-emerging in uglier manifestations in the mostunexpected places  killing innocent people  includingchildren. The disappointing impasse on globaldisarmament and the dreadful odds of furtherproliferation of weapons of mass destruction make usill at ease and cause us to lose hope for a peacefulworld.We in small States feel more vulnerable to thesechallenges and threats  as our security is entirelydependent on the prevalence of global security and theobservance of the rule of law by all States. Clearly  theconcerns of small States cannot be confined only to theissues of the environment  climate change  sea-levelrise and sustainable development. The ominous threatsthat are emerging on the political and security fronts ofthe contemporary world have far-reaching implicationsfor us as well.Not too infrequently  we witness small Statesbeing victimized by non-State actors such as terrorists mercenaries  insurrectionary gangs and organizedcrime networks  whose calculated assaults disruptsocio-economic and political development of smallStates  endangering peace and security. It would beimprudent to ignore the wider implications of thepresence and activities of such perilous actors oninternational peace and security. Solutions to thosethreats can only be sought through internationalcooperation  vigilance and timely action.It is imperative that the international communitytakes on the crucial responsibility of protecting thesecurity of small States  as stipulated by GeneralAssembly resolutions 44/51  of 8 December 1989 46/43  of 9 December 1991  and 49/31  of 9 December1994. With its global spread and ability to work incollaboration with regional institutions  we see theOrganization as the most appropriate body to addresssuch issues.Terrorism poses grave threats to regional as wellas international peace and security. The train bombingsin Madrid; car bombings and terrorist attacks in Iraq Indonesia and Saudi Arabia; and  most recently  thehostage-taking tragedy in a Russian school  are all grimreminders of the particularly insidious nature ofterrorism. I am sure that I echo the unanimity of theinternational community in reiterating that the waragainst terrorism should continue to remain a principalpriority on the international agenda. My Government4believes that early adoption of the proposedinternational convention on terrorism would be acrucial step in effectively combating that dreadfulmenace.Expanding globalization and increasing tradeliberalization  contrary to the hopes for a healthierglobal market  have had a distressing price tag forsmall economies  especially for small island economiessuch as the Maldives. Limited natural resources and thenarrow economic base of small island economiesseverely restrict their scope for diversification and theirability to attract foreign investment. Thosedisadvantages call for special considerations  includinga level of preferential treatment  on an exceptionalbasis  to ensure the sustainable development of smallisland developing States.While the Maldives is beset by the entire range ofeconomic problems inherent to small island developingStates  the recommendation by the Committee forDevelopment Policy (CDP) to graduate us from the listof least developed countries has compounded thechallenges to our development. We do take pride in ourachievements in the social and economic sectors duringthe last two decades. However  we fear that graduationmay cause enormous and irreparable damage to oureconomy  in the absence of a suitable mechanism toensure sustained socio-economic development. In thatcontext  we welcome the recommendation of the CDPand the decision of the Economic and Social Councilearlier this year indicating the need to formulatesmooth transition strategies for least developedcountries prior to their graduation.We support in particular the recommendation todecide post-graduation transition arrangements on acase-by-case basis and to establish ad hoc countryadvisory groups to help formulate those arrangements.We strongly feel that it is important for the Economicand Social Council to formally endorse thearrangements proposed by the ad hoc country advisorygroups while mandating the CDP with the task ofmonitoring the progress of newly graduated countriesfor any disruptions in their development.Allow me  at this juncture  to register our sinceregratitude and appreciation to our development partnersand the members of the Group of 77  the Group ofLeast Developed Countries and the Bureau andmembers of the Economic and Social Council for theunderstanding and the care with which they areproceeding on this crucial and important issue.The state of the global environment is asdepressing as ever. Statistical information andprojections are alarming and disturbing  not only tosmall island developing States but also to the entireinternational community. Those figures and predictionsreveal the severity of environmental problems and thepotential threats to human existence unless swiftremedial measures are implemented.The frequency with which we have beenwitnessing natural disasters such as hurricanes andcyclones around the world demonstrates the urgentneed to tackle environmental issues on a global scale.Many small island developing States sufferdisproportionately from such hazards  underscoring thevulnerability of small island developing States in thatregard. As we recently witnessed in Grenada  a singlehurricane can lay waste to decades-long developmentalprogress in a matter of a few hours.We will soon be meeting in Mauritius to reviewthe progress made over the past decade in theimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Actionfor the Sustainable Development of Small IslandStates. If we are to make the forthcoming meeting inMauritius a success  we need to muster the necessarypolitical will to channel resources and to ensure thecomprehensive realization of the objectives of theBarbados Programme of Action.The complexity and magnitude of ever-developing global challenges demand that a reformedUnited Nations be assigned the central role in dealingwith them. While those reforms should cover the entireUnited Nations system and its bodies  the focus is onceagain justly being drawn to the urgency of the need torestructure the Security Council  making the Councilmore reflective of the realities of the present-day worldand more representative of the capacity andcommitment of Member States to contribute tointernational peace and security. It is disappointing though  that no common view has emerged on thatissue. We feel that we should go ahead with theenlargement of the Security Council  both in thepermanent and non-permanent categories and includingin that enlargement countries such as Japan and otherMember States that have the capacity and thecommitment to serve as permanent members and that5would represent the wider membership of the present-day United Nations.The international treaty regime has to beexpanded and strengthened so that emerging problemscan be dealt with more effectively. We feel that thattask should be a priority in enforcing the principles forwhich the United Nations stands and the values ofpeace  security  justice  equality  human rights democracy and rules-based international order that ithas advocated. In that context  we applaud the remarksmade by the Secretary-General at the opening meetingof the General Assembly  and wish to express oursupport for his efforts to reform the United Nationssystem.The rapid socio-economic development attainedby the Maldives in the past two and a half decades is inno small part grounded in the political stability that wehave enjoyed during that period. To emphasize furtherthe need to promote and sustain the values ofdemocracy and respect for human rights  PresidentGayoom proposed a sweeping agenda for politicalreform in early June of this year. The Governmentremains firmly committed to carry out the reformagenda  which has been welcomed and supported byboth the people of the country and its friends in theinternational community. A special people’s assemblywas convened  as required by the Constitution  and wascharged with the task of debating reforms to the currentConstitution proposed by the Government and civilsociety.We seek the support and assistance of our friendsin the international community in our pursuit of thatunprecedented reform agenda. The solidarity of theinternational community at this crucial hour of needwould reinforce our resolve and help us move aheadwith the reform agenda with increased veracity anddiligence.My Government is also committed to respectingand observing human rights through adherence torelevant international conventions. In that regard  I ampleased to announce that the Maldives will this weeksign a framework agreement with the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross. We will also keep underconsideration the signing of other importantinstruments  such as the Rome Statute of theInternational Criminal Court.Before concluding  I should like to reaffirm ourcommitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter.My country believes this Organization to be the bestsuited to working for the betterment of humanity andthe maintenance of international peace and security."
"112",4540,"MEX",59,2004,"Thesession of the General Assembly over which you willpreside  Sir  will be one of the most important in thehistory of the United Nations. It will be a sessioncharacterized by the necessary renewal of the UnitedNations. The year 2005 will be decisive for the futureof multilateralism and of our global Organization.The debate on Iraq and the spreading wave ofinternational terrorism have raised a series of questionsabout the future of our collective security system. Atthis session  the General Assembly has before it thetask of beginning an unprecedented reflection on thechanges our societies require of multilateral diplomacy.Our efforts must result in new tools that will enable theUnited Nations to find effective solutions to carry outthe lofty mission of tackling anew the tasks ofdevelopment  maintaining world peace and security promoting human rights and democracy and protectingthe environment — all under the rule of internationallaw.As a result of recent debates  some have raisedtheir voices to assert that the international communityis fractured and even in conflict. It is curious that thatis happening at a time in the life of the world whenthreats and challenges are more clearly shared by allnations. The tasks that should unite us focus on thefight against abject poverty  international terrorism organized crime syndicates  major epidemics  theproliferation of arsenals of weapons of massdestruction and the deterioration of the environment. Inorder to put an end to those ills  concerted action andcommitment are required from all States. The reason isobvious: the most complex threats we face do not haveany specific national origin  but they affect us all andhave ultimately worsened the quality of life in theworld and damaged the peace and well-being of ourcitizens.The United Nations was designed to put an end tothe scourge of wars between nations and to promote theeconomic and social development of peoples. We facephenomena of such magnitude and complexity that the35delegates who attended the San FranciscoConference — despite their outstanding talent andvision — could not have anticipated at the time. Thediplomats of our generation have the obligation ofenvisioning a second phase  inaugurating a new chapterof collective action to eradicate these dangerousmodern-day evils.In Mexico’s view  the goal to which we shouldaspire is not to rebuild the Organization from scratch orto discard the United Nations Charter  with its richheritage of agreements and concepts. It would not beresponsible to abandon such essential tools aslegitimate individual or collective self-defence  as setout in Article 51  and the establishment of a collectivesecurity system. The only viable  rational andnecessary approach is to update the multilateral systemof cooperation and understanding that we have builttogether.It was on the basis of those considerations thatPresident Vicente Fox of Mexico  when he addressedthe General Assembly last year  made a robust appealfor comprehensive reform of the United Nations.Furthermore  in many meetings that he has held sincethen with other heads of State or Government  he hasexpressed considerable interest in moving forward —with the urgency that the situation requires — towardsstrengthening and revitalizing the United Nations.That is why we have undertaken an effort ofactive coordination aimed at reforming the UnitedNations and strengthening multilateralism. Mexico together with 14 other countries  has begun an effort ofjoint reflection to analyse the various components ofreform and to devise a diplomatic strategy to guide thesteady progress of United Nations reform.We envision reform with an evolutionaryapproach that would enable the United Nations totackle the most delicate challenges and threats of eachhistorical cycle  drawing on the resources and strengthsof all Member States in order to overcome the mostdisturbing international phenomena. That exerciseshould begin to bear fruit in the next 18 months.Two thousand and five will be an appropriateyear to promote this ambitious project: there will be aconvergence of events that will enable us to revitalizemultilateral dialogue and interaction. First  inDecember 2004  we will receive the report and therecommendations of the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change  whichwill be of valuable assistance in guiding ourdeliberations on reform of the system. It will be veryimportant that we examine those recommendations inminute detail and that the General Assembly be thecentral forum for discussing and adopting the newmandates and changes that must be implemented in theOrganization. Likewise  next year we will have toassess the progress made in implementing theMillennium Declaration and the steps taken to followup the Monterrey Consensus on financing fordevelopment.That series of events in 2005 will give us an up-to-date view of the state of the multilateral system andof the issues that reform should address. With thatbroad perspective  and so that we can live up to thecommitment and interest of all Member States  we willneed to ensure a balance between the security anddevelopment agendas and their respective institutionswithin the system. The General Assembly  the SecurityCouncil and the Economic and Social Council mustwork as part of an organic whole  not as entities thatare disconnected and sometimes even at odds in theirtasks  priorities and working methods.The predominance of the Security Council hasresulted in growing disregard for the work of otherprincipal organs and has diminished their effectiveness.This causes certain issues to be marginalized; then when they reach crisis level  they become matters forwhich the Security Council becomes responsible. Wealso must acknowledge that the overall process ofUnited Nations reform has been dominated — in fact paralysed — by the debate on restructuring theSecurity Council.Mexico believes that any Security Council reformprocess should be governed by a set of commonobjectives and criteria. After more than a decade ofwork  we should ask ourselves why Security Councilreform has not succeeded. The debate has focused onthe number of seats  how they should be allocated toeach region and whether or not they should bepermanent seats. Mexico does not share that approachbecause  paradoxically  the fundamental question thathas largely been ignored — which came to the foreduring the critical discussion on Iraq — is not howmany members there should be on the Security Counciland how many should be permanent; rather  it is whatkind of collective security system does theinternational community need today  and what36mechanisms should be used to face new challengesand  above all  to prevent conflicts.The Security Council must create conditions thatwill prevent the emergence of conflicts  particularlythrough building and consolidating national institutionsand upholding the rule of law and respect for humanrights. The Council should also enhance its capacity toconsistently identify situations likely to endanger peaceand security. As a logical outcome of such an analysis we can then identify the changes needed in the SecurityCouncil.Mexico acknowledges the contributions ofMember States to the cause of peace  all of themnecessary. Our Organization  based on the legalequality of States  requires the commitment andsupport of all its Members  through their involvementin decision-making. The creation of new permanentseats would lead to greater concentration of theinternational decision-making process than is now thecase. We cannot ignore the fact that permanentmembers of the Council already have more influencethan the rest of the membership. Mexico considers thatthis should be restricted and not further increased.Mexico supports collective decision-making asthe source of the legitimacy and effectiveness of ouractions in favour of peace and security. In that regard we favour a regionally equitable and balancedenlargement of the number of elected members  basedon modalities determined within the regional groups.That would stimulate wider participation in thedecision-making process and would ensure that morecountries  not fewer  can contribute their views in theCouncil.Thus  Mexico would support an increase in thenumber of elected members and an extension of theirterm of office  with the option of immediate re-electionfor those States that have demonstrated  through theirperformance  a strong commitment to the purposes ofthe Organization. That would help us to create agenuine mechanism for accountability  founded onArticle 24 of the Charter.As part of this integral vision of reform  it iscrucial also to strengthen the role of the Economic andSocial Council  which supports the Security Counciland the General Assembly in the decision-makingprocess. Conflict prevention depends upon timelyattention to and action on problems that lead to a lackof access to development. It is undeniable that peaceand security are anchored on the well-being of ourpeoples. Therefore  we believe that the Economic andSocial Council should work as a coordinating body tosteer the financing of development and to articulate thefollow-up of commitments stemming from UnitedNations summits and conferences on social andeconomic development.It is essential to have a more committedinvolvement of the international financial institutionsin the development process. In that regard  theEconomic and Social Council should play a pivotalrole linking the Bretton Woods institutions  the WorldTrade Organization (WTO)  the private sector and civilsociety.Another issue that is worth our attention in thereform process is the Commission on Human Rights which has essential responsibilities regarding universalrespect for individual rights and fundamental freedoms.Mexico considers that the work of the Commission isvital  although its procedural weakness in advancing itsobjectives is clear. For this reason  its methods must beurgently reformulated. Mexico is fostering regionaldialogue on this issue.The ongoing effort in favour of United Nationsreform requires a vision of collective well-being andenhanced political understanding  in order to prevent“threats without a passport” from plunging the worldinto a spiral of confrontation  violence and despair.Here  we should recognize that the United Nations hasalready taken some first steps in the right direction particularly in the fight against terrorism and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As partof the reform  it will be necessary to carry these actionsfurther.In this context  Mexico is ready to continueworking with the institutional structures of theOrganization  particularly the Counter-TerrorismCommittee and the non-proliferation machinery. Wewill continue to promote the protection of human rightsand fundamental freedoms in the fight againstterrorism as the only way to guarantee the legitimacyand efficacy of that fight. My country will also followclosely the cooperation initiatives and regimes gearedto control the export of nuclear materials; and we willstress the need to strengthen efforts in the urgent causeof disarmament.Other positive steps have been taken in recentyears to confront the grave challenges resulting from37humanitarian crises and genocide. In this context Mexico concurs with the concept of the responsibilityto protect  in the sense that sovereignty entails a State’sobligation towards its population  and that  when itfails to fulfil it  the international community has theduty to collectively assist in the protection ofindividuals from serious human rights violations. In thelight of recent regrettable humanitarian tragedies  it isof the utmost importance for the General Assembly todiscuss this concept thoroughly  in order to elaborateguidelines for its practical application within theOrganization.Bearing in mind the scope of the reformchallenge facing us  Mexico would favour theconvening of a general conference with the aim ofupdating and strengthening our Organization. Incontrast to the consideration that has been given toother issues of international relevance  such as trade population and the environment  we have not held anyopen-ended rounds of negotiations in the last sixdecades on issues pertaining to international politicsand the progressive development of diplomacy. Thechanges that have taken place in the world in thatperiod demand a comprehensive exercise that shouldencompass the renewal of our commitments  review ofcollective security structures and their performance above all  promotion of economic development.Throughout President Fox’s administration Mexico has clearly shown its commitment to thestrengthening of multilateralism. We have done so asan elected member of the Security Council  as apromoter of international conventions on topics such ascorruption  persons with disabilities and migrants  byfurthering initiatives to foster the equitable andsustainable development of global areas and by hostinghigh-level conferences such as the MonterreyConference on Financing for Development and theSummit of the Americas.Furthermore  as an unequivocal sign of ourinterest  our concerns and our commitment  Mexico isdecisively promoting the revitalization of themultilateral system through the Group of Friends forthe Reform of the United Nations.It is in that constructive spirit that Mexico istaking part in this session of the General Assembly. Weare certain that under your able leadership Mr. President  this session will be remembered as thecatalyst for one of the most important and dominantchapters in the life of our Organization."
"113",4565,"MHL",59,2004,"I am honoured to address theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on behalf ofthe Republic of the Marshall Islands.Allow me to extend my congratulations to you Mr. President  on your election  and to wish you well inyour endeavours throughout this session.This year has seen important landmarks for theMarshall Islands at the domestic level. On 1 May wecelebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoptionof our Constitution. The same day also marked theentry into force of our amended Compact of FreeAssociation with the United States. The renewal of thatagreement reaffirms the special relationship betweenour two countries.At the regional level  we continue to place greatimportance on our membership in the Pacific IslandsForum. Over the past year  the Forum has conducted acomprehensive review of existing regionalmechanisms. Last month Pacific leaders met in Samoa where they endorsed the terms of reference of a newPacific Plan  which will develop a strategy for broaderregional cooperation based on the key goals ofeconomic growth  sustainable development  goodgovernance and security.At the international level  the Marshall Islandsreaffirms its solidarity with the Alliance of SmallIsland States (AOSIS)  which continues to act as apowerful voice for small island developing States.It has long been recognized that small islanddeveloping States suffer from unique vulnerabilitiesand disadvantages. In January 2005  the internationalcommunity will meet in Mauritius to conduct the10-year review of the Barbados Programme of Actionfor the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States. Over the past year  members ofAOSIS have been engaged in a detailed process ofpreparation for the international meeting. At aninterregional meeting in January  small islanddeveloping States adopted the AOSIS Strategy for theFurther Implementation of the Barbados Programme ofAction  which addresses critical issues includingclimate change and sea-level rise  renewable energy trade access and others.It is vital that we maintain the momentum in thelead-up to Mauritius in order to ensure a successfuloutcome for small island developing States. Iencourage the international community to becomeengaged in the ongoing preparatory process and toparticipate in the international meeting at the highestlevel. It is our fervent hope that the meeting willproduce practical outcomes that will assist small islanddeveloping States in implementing the Programme ofAction to benefit people at the local level.In this increasingly globalized world  theMarshall Islands faces challenges shared by manyother small island States. Our environment is extremelyvulnerable to the effects of climate change and naturaldisasters; our small population faces the challenge ofmanaging high levels of major diseases such asdiabetes  and the risk of the rapid spread of HIV/AIDSand other sexually transmitted diseases; and our limitedresource base and remoteness restrict our ability tointegrate into the global economy.With these challenges in mind  the MarshallIslands is particularly concerned about the followingissues.First  regarding sustainable development  theMarshall Islands has developed a national sustainabledevelopment strategy  and we are in the process ofestablishing a task force to ensure that the MillenniumDevelopment Goals are fully integrated into ournational strategy. In striving to achieve internationallyagreed development goals  we are severely constrainedby our lack of human and technical resources. Thus wecontinue to seek to form partnerships that will assist usthrough capacity-building and technology transfer.We were pleased that the twelfth session of theCommission on Sustainable Development focused onwater  sanitation and human settlements. We in thePacific region are working hard to improve access tofresh water and to develop environmentally responsiblewaste-management systems. We seek the support of theinternational community to assist us in theimplementation of regional projects such as the PacificRegional Action Plan on Sustainable WaterManagement. We look forward to the thirteenth sessionof the Commission’s providing further policy guidancein these areas.23An ongoing issue of the utmost concern for thepeople of the Marshall Islands is that of nuclear-weapon testing. Between 1946 and 1958  the UnitedStates conducted a series of nuclear tests in theMarshall Islands  which included the detonation of 23atomic and hydrogen bombs. On 1 March this year wecommemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the Bravotest at Bikini atoll. The Bravo blast was 1 000 timesmore powerful than Hiroshima  and its fallout spreadradioactive debris across the neighbouring islands.Today  many of our people continue to sufferfrom the long-term health effects  while others remaindisplaced from their homes because of ongoingcontamination. We urge the United States Governmentto fully address the issue of adequate compensation forpopulations affected by the nuclear testing programmeand to fulfil its responsibilities regarding the saferesettlement of displaced populations.On broader issues of disarmament and non-proliferation  we urge the international community toretain a focus on disarmament by the nuclear-weaponStates  as well as on non-proliferation measures. Welook forward to next year’s Review Conference of theParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  and we hope that the Conferencewill produce substantial progress on the 13 stepstowards complete nuclear disarmament.I wish to reiterate our critical concern regardingclimate change. Along with other low-lying islandnations  we are most vulnerable to the impacts ofclimate change. We are already experiencing thesedramatic effects: sea levels are rising  weather patternsare changing and coral reef systems are being harmed.Urgent action is needed at the global level to halt andultimately reverse the devastating impact of climatechange. Without such global action  our national effortsat sustainable development will ultimately be renderedmeaningless.While we are committed to playing our part strong leadership is required by the majorindustrialized countries. We renew our support for theFramework Convention on Climate Change and theKyoto Protocol  and we call upon all States that havenot yet done so — in particular the major emitters — toratify the Protocol without further delay. We also callupon the international community to assist small islanddeveloping States in developing and implementingcomprehensive adaptation strategies.As a nation whose livelihood depends on theresources of the sea  we are becoming increasinglyconcerned about the state of the world’s oceans andfish stocks. At the regional level  we cooperate closelywith other members of the Pacific Islands Forum toensure that the oceans and marine resources in ourregion are managed in a responsible and sustainablemanner. The Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy adopted in 2002  will be implemented throughout theregion under a recently developed framework forintegrated strategic action. Another notableachievement in the region is the entry into force of theConvention on the Conservation and Management ofHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western andCentral Pacific Ocean.While such developments are encouraging  wereiterate our concerns regarding the prevalence ofillegal  unreported and unregulated fishing. Like manyother small island developing States  we rely onfisheries resources as a primary means of survival  yetwe lack the capacity to adequately monitor ourexclusive economic zone. Regional and internationalcooperation must focus on addressing the problem ofillegal  unreported and unregulated fishing andassisting small island developing States by buildingcapacity for monitoring and surveillance.I have briefly mentioned a few of the majorpriorities for the Marshall Islands. There are  of course many other important issues to be addressed during theupcoming session.International terrorism is obviously one of thebiggest challenges facing the global community today.The reality is that no State or region is immune. AllStates must take action at the national level and mustcooperate at the regional and international levels toensure that we combat terrorist threats withcomprehensive and unified action. Within the Pacificregion  we continue to cooperate closely to ensure thateffective regional action is taken to combat threats topeace and security. At the national level  we are in theprocess of implementing the 12 core anti-terrorismconventions and the relevant Security Councilresolutions  and we have taken many steps to combatmoney laundering and terrorist financing.The Marshall Islands  as a State party to theRome Statute  welcomes the ongoing progress of theInternational Criminal Court. We are pleased that theCourt is now fully operational and has begun its first24investigations. We are confident that the Court willplay a valuable role in the administration of justice atthe international level  and we urge those States thathave not yet done so to become parties.Another issue requiring action by this body is thecontinued exclusion of Taiwan from the UnitedNations. Taiwan is a peace-loving  sovereign State  andonly its democratically elected Government can be thelegitimate representative of the interests of the peopleof Taiwan within the United Nations. The MarshallIslands reiterates its full support for the ongoing questof the people of Taiwan to be granted membership inthis global body and in various other internationalorganizations.Finally  the Marshall Islands reiterates its supportfor the expansion of the Security Council in bothcategories of membership. We support the allocation ofa new permanent seat to Japan  and we believe that therepresentation on the Council of developing countriesmust be increased. Such expansion is crucial if theCouncil is to retain its legitimacy.My delegation looks forward  Mr. President  to aproductive session under your able leadership."
"114",4589,"MKD",59,2004,"Allow me at the outsetto extend my congratulations to you  Mr. Jean Ping  onyour election as President of the fifty-ninth session ofthe General Assembly  and to express my convictionthat this session will be concluded successfully underyour presidency. Moreover  I take this opportunity tocongratulate the President of the fifty-eighth session Mr. Julian Hunte  on his dedication and on thesuccessful fulfilment of his responsibilities.Last year was extremely challenging  for both theworld community and the United Nations. In thatregard  I would like to commend Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan for his efforts and contributions inpreserving peace in the world. In his recent address(see )  he clearly demonstrated once againhis dedication to the cause of the Organization.We certainly all agree that the United Nationscontinues to be the most relevant global forumaddressing international peacekeeping and securityissues. We also agree on the need to renew and reformits bodies and agendas in order to preserve the vitalrole of the Organization. In that context  we lookforward to reading the report being drafted by theHigh-Level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change which was created by the Secretary-General.With regard to the reform of the Security Council the Republic of Macedonia considers it extremelyimportant to increase the membership of the Council withregard to both permanent and non-permanent seats.The renewal and strengthening of the role of theEconomic and Social Council is equally relevant. TheRepublic of Macedonia has presented its candidacy forthe election to the Economic and Social Council to beheld during this session. We are confident that  ifelected and with the support of the General Assembly my country will be able to make its full contribution toimproving the efficiency of the Council.As far as the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly is concerned  we think that we must seizethe momentum  implement the provisions of therevised agenda and pursue efforts to make the work ofthe Main Committees more focused and rational.Unfortunately  once again this year  inhuman actsof terrorism have continued to take innocent lives andto preoccupy world public opinion. We were allhorrified by the images of human suffering in Madrid Beslan and elsewhere. In order to enhance the capacityof the international community in this respect  we needto further consolidate the world anti-terrorist coalitionled by the United Nations and  additionally  strengthencooperation with regional organizations that havespecific mechanisms to fight this global evil.The Republic of Macedonia will continue its activecooperation with the Counter-Terrorism Committee ofthe Security Council and make its own contribution tothe implementation of resolution 1373 (2001). In thatregard  I would like to inform the Assembly that  lastMay  the Republic of Macedonia ratified theInternational Convention for the Suppression of theFinancing of Terrorism and the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionremains one of the major threats to international peaceand security  and it is closely related to terrorism. Wewelcome the Security Council’s adoption of resolution1540 (2004) on the non-proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction. The implementation of thatresolution will complement the existing set ofinstruments and consolidate the role of the SecurityCouncil in this area.The suppression of the illicit trade in small armsand light weapons and the total prohibition of anti-personnel mines are also very important issues  giventhe size of the problem and the number of victimscaused by mines. Doing so will contribute greatly toconflict prevention and successful peacekeeping andpeace-building throughout the world  including ourregion. At the end of last year  the Republic ofMacedonia conducted a successful effort to collectsmall arms and light weapons. That effort had thesupport of the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme. Efforts in this regard are ongoing.We expect that the first review conference ofcountries parties to the Ottawa Convention  which is tobe held in Nairobi  will produce a summary of theresults achieved through the implementation of thatextremely important instrument  which will pave theway to the creation of a world free of landmines.The Republic of Macedonia has destroyed itsmine stockpiles and is working on the demining ofaffected regions. The United Nations Mine ActionService  together with the International Trust Fund for5Demining and Mine Victims Assistance  have provideda great deal of help in our demining activities.Unfortunately  violent conflicts have continuedthis year. The armed conflict in Darfur and the terriblehumanitarian tragedy it brought about require decisiveaction. We support the Security Council resolution inthis regard  and we join the call for further and urgentaction on this matter.The situation in the Middle East continues tokeep the world on edge. We support the efforts of theQuartet to find a solution acceptable to all sides and weshare the conviction that the road map is the only wayto reach a solution for Palestine and Israel  twoneighbouring States that will one day live in peace.Building peace and fostering democracy inAfghanistan and Iraq  where the Republic ofMacedonia is part of the multinational force  remains achallenge facing both the international community andthe peoples of those two countries. I would like toemphasize the exceptional importance of theimplementation of resolution 1546 (2004)  whichendorsed the restoration of Iraq’s sovereignty andprovided the core framework for the politicaltransformation and democratization of that State.With regard to Iraq  I would like to appeal to theauthorities of that country to do their utmost to find thethree Macedonian citizens who have disappeared there.The Millennium Development Goals remain thekey challenge for the Organization. In September 2005 heads of State and Government from around the worldwill meet to review what has been done in realizing theGoals in the five years since the adoption of theMillennium Summit Declaration. It is crystal clear thatwe must take decisive steps if we want to mobilizepolitical will and resources and carry out reforms on thenational and global levels to meet the Goals by 2015.However  it is already clear that some regions ofthe world will find it very difficult to achieve theprojected Goals. Special attention should be dedicatedto Africa  where the situation is alarming and the issuesof poverty and hunger eradication and the problem ofAIDS are very serious. Achieving the Goals will not bepossible unless the international community is ready toassume its share of responsibility in that respect.The Republic of Macedonia places specialemphasis on the importance of effective respect for and promotion of  human rights as one of the pillars ofevery democratic society. The rule of law and effectiverespect for human rights are the best instrument inpreventing conflicts  as well as prerequisites for peaceand prosperity. Today  we are increasingly aware of theneed to nurture and respect multiculturalism as aprecondition to the development of a secure andharmonious world. In that regard  every effort shouldbe made to create mutual confidence and understandingand to promote respect for differences. The Republic ofMacedonia is deeply committed to those principles and we adhere to them strictly in our actions.For half a century now  the United Nations hashad a key role in the development of internationalhuman rights law. In that context  we welcome currentefforts to harmonize the draft international conventionto protect the rights of disabled persons.Good-neighbourly relations are one of the foreignpolicy priorities of the Republic of Macedonia  as oneof the promoters of regional cooperation in South-EastEurope. I would like to take this opportunity to informthe Assembly that  as during previous sessions  thedelegation of the Republic of Macedonia will proposethe adoption by the General Assembly of a draftresolution on good-neighbourly relations  stability anddevelopment in South-Eastern Europe.In recent years  the countries of the region havemade considerable progress at both the domestic leveland in developing mutual relations. We are activelycooperating in numerous regional initiatives and in theframework of the Euro-Atlantic integration process.However  despite the considerable progress made at thelevel of stabilization and improved security in theregion  not all sources of potential instability have beeneliminated. We strongly believe that the process of theregion’s accelerated integration into the EuropeanUnion and NATO will weaken existing threats at thenational and regional levels.As an immediate neighbouring country  theRepublic of Macedonia is following with particularattention the developments in Kosovo. We fullysupport the United Nations policy of standards beforestatus  whose final goal is to establish a true multi-ethnic community and to improve security democratization and the rule of law. At the same time the Republic of Macedonia is also lending itscontinued support to the United Nations and otherinternational bodies as they carry out their responsiblemissions.6We have developed contractual cooperation withthe United Nations Interim Administration Mission inKosovo in various areas  with a view to resolvingconcrete issues that are relevant to the population. Weexpect very soon to start the process of the demarcationof our border with Kosovo. Also with regard toKosovo  I would like to emphasize the fact that anydecision on its future status must not result in thedestabilization of the region.The Republic of Macedonia is going through acritical stage in the process of carrying outfundamental economic and social reforms andtransforming its society to prepare it for acceleratedintegration into the European Union. The finalizationof the implementation of the framework agreementconcluded in 2001 is a priority in that process. Most ofthe legal regulations resulting from the constitutionalchanges flowing from the framework agreement havealready been adopted. Nevertheless  one of the mainissues pertaining to decentralization — namely territorial reorganization — could pose a challenge given the upcoming referendum. That referendum is ademocratic event of the highest order that providescitizens with an opportunity to express their opinionson the concept being put forth by the Government.Finally  I would like to conclude by saying thatthe world is facing a range of challenges and threats but that our experience so far has proven that there isno alternative to the multilateral approach toovercoming threats to international peace and security.Our experience has also proven that dialogue remainsthe most valuable and powerful instrument in ourendeavours to create a different and safer world."
"115",4635,"MLI",59,2004,"Allow meat the outset warmly to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-ninth session and to assure you and the othermembers of the Bureau  whom I also congratulate  ofthe full support of the delegation of Mali as you carryout your mission.I also wish to pay tribute to the dedication ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan and to thank him for histireless efforts in the service of the United Nations.Six days ago  Mali commemorated in its own waythe forty-fourth anniversary of its independence. Fromthis high rostrum  the most symbolic of all  I wish torecall the efforts of my country to build  under theleadership of Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré  President ofthe Republic and Head of State  a democratic  stableand prosperous Mali asserting its place in the concertof nations.For several weeks now  our country and others ofthe North and West African regions  have been strickenby an unprecedented locust infestation. As PresidentAmadou Toumani Touré stressed in his message to thenation on 22 September  the magnitude and speed ofthe infestation have surpassed the most pessimisticprojections. The catastrophic effects of that insectplague on the upcoming harvest and on our vegetationare a true threat to the livelihood of the millions of menand women thus exposed to famine.The Government of the Republic of Mali isactively working to suppress the scourge  above allthrough a national mobilization that has brought teams brigades and village communities to work in the field and with the support of the international community and in particular to brotherly African countries. Ireiterate here my country’s gratitude to them all. I alsowish firmly to say  however  that  faced with the insectplague and in order to ensure the food security ofinfested countries  including Mali  we have a sharedresponsibility to launch and strengthen short-  medium-16and long-term international mobilization. We must act act quickly and act effectively.Questions related to international peace andsecurity continue to be a source of concern to us. In thepast year we have seen crises and conflicts multiplythroughout the world. I would like  in particular  torecall the situation in West Africa and Mali’s initiativesto contribute to the settlement of the crisis in Côted’Ivoire  whose subregional repercussions areconsiderable and fraught with consequences for peaceand stability in West Africa.In this regard  the so-called Bamako II meetingmade it possible to establish the conditions for thesuccess of the Accra III high-level meeting. Iforcefully echo the assertion of President AmadouToumani Touré that Mali will continue to supportpeace and reconciliation in Côte d’Ivoire: peace for thepeople of Côte d’Ivoire  and peace for all of theforeigners who live in that brotherly neighbouringcountry.Here I would mention Mali’s participation in thepeacekeeping missions of the United Nations  theAfrican Union and the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) in Liberia  Sierra Leone  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Burundi and Haiti.Furthermore  Mali’s commitment to internationalpeace and security is at the root of our country’s actionto make the Sahelo-Saharan area a focal point ofdevelopment and stability. This was especially evidentduring the Malian presidency of the Community ofSahelo-Saharan States.Mali is also deeply concerned by the situation inthe Middle East: measures to close off Palestinianterritories  arbitrary arrests  extrajudiciary executions the destruction of property  land seizures  lack ofrespect for resolutions adopted by the internationalcommunity and the siege imposed upon PresidentArafat. Those actions do not help to establish truepeace in that part of the world. Mali  which has alwayssupported the just cause of the Palestinian people urgently appeals to the members of the Quartet torestore dialogue between Israel and the PalestinianAuthority  with a view to a just  equitable and lastingsettlement of a conflict which has gone on too long.International terrorism is today another challengeto international peace and security. We have seen thisphenomenon on all continents  making it abundantlyclear that terrorism has neither homeland nor religion.That is why the international community must displaysteadfast political will in combating terrorism by  interalia  strengthening the available legal arsenal including mechanisms for cooperation and technicalassistance. Beyond this  we must tackle the root causesof the phenomenon  which include poverty  massivehuman rights violations  intolerance  injustice andimpunity from prosecution.The question of small arms and light weapons isalso a primary concern for us. Mali has made asignificant contribution in this area by developinginitiatives at the subregional  regional and internationallevels. In this regard  Mali is striving to transform theECOWAS Moratorium on the Importation  Exportationand Manufacture of Small Arms and Light Weapons inWest Africa into a convention. We further believe thatthe international community must now resolutelyengage in the establishment of a binding legalinstrument on marking  registering and tracing smallarms and light weapons.The situation of children in armed conflicts isalso a source of concern for my country. We fullysupport the recommendations contained in the report ofthe Special Representative to the Secretary-General forChildren and Armed Conflict (E/CN.4/2004/70)  andcall for the effective implementation of SecurityCouncil resolution 1539 (2004). Along the same lines Mali is working within the Human Security Network tokeep this question among the priorities of ourOrganization.In order to effectively prevent and manage thesesituations of crisis and conflict — that is  to preserveand guarantee international peace and security — theinternational community must work for an internationalorder that is based on the rule of law  and for a UnitedNations whose legitimacy is strengthened. Thus  wewelcome the establishment of the High-Level Panel onThreats  Challenges and Change  and we anxiouslyawait its conclusions.The question of development is  and must remain a priority issue on the international agenda  and thuswe welcome the decision to hold a plenary meeting in2005 devoted to follow-up of the outcome of theMillennium Summit  and to a comprehensive andcoordinated follow-up and implementation ofdocuments from the major conferences and summitmeetings organized by the United Nations on economic17and social topics. We hope that that meeting willenable us to conduct an objective and candid review ofthe way in which commitments have been met including the progress achieved and obstaclesremaining in the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.Defeating poverty is a major objective for theGovernment of the Republic of Mali. As part of thatendeavour  the adoption in 2002  and theimplementation  of a strategic framework  has made itpossible to achieve important results in the areas ofeducation  health  rural development and basicinfrastructure. I take this opportunity to express Mali’ssupport for the initiative launched by PresidentsJacques Chirac and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  whichled to the New York Declaration on Action AgainstHunger and Poverty adopted on 20 September 2004.On trade negotiations  Mali attaches greatimportance to the round of trade negotiations underway within the World Trade Organization (WTO): theDoha development round. We hope that thosenegotiations will lead to an economic system whichwill enable all countries  especially developingcountries  to fully maximize their potential. We hope tosee a true breakthrough in agricultural negotiations which should lead to the elimination of subsidies andother production and export support mechanisms particularly with respect to cotton. Indeed  cotton isone of the commodities where we  African producercountries  offer true comparative advantages  sinceproduction costs are one fifth those in developedcountries. At present  however  our countries areseriously harmed by production and export subsidiesfor cotton.For that reason  we reaffirm our opposition tosubsidy policies which undermine free marketcompetition  lead to overproduction and lower priceson the international market and prevent our agriculturefrom getting off the ground.That is why Mali is also calling for the gradualelimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers  as wellas the implementation of measures on the freemovement of people  goods and services. We arepleased with the European Union’s commitment tofacilitate the integration of least developed countrieswithin the multilateral trading system  includingthrough the adoption in April 2004 of an action planfor agriculture that includes a proposal for an Africa-Europe partnership on cotton.The AIDS pandemic is progressing at such analarming rate that  in addition to its healthrepercussions  it has today become a problem foreconomic and social development  especially in Africa.That is why we must implement  urgently and in full the commitments that we undertook in 2001 so that wecan mobilize the necessary energy and resources toeffectively fight the scourge. Mali has set up amultisectoral programme to fight HIV/AIDS at a costof $150 million  or 73 billion CFA francs. Theimplementation of that programme will make itpossible to distribute antiretroviral drugs to patientsfree of charge  as well as to provide necessary impetusto the information and awareness campaign with aview to prevention. Pilot laboratories for screening andcounselling will be established throughout the country and small and medium-sized businesses for socialoutreach will be set up  thus providing jobs for youngpeople.With regard to the situation of people withdisabilities  Mali is pleased with the negotiations thatare under way with a view to elaborating a conventionto protect their rights and dignity. We are convincedthat the adoption of such an instrument would establisha framework for improved social and economicintegration for people with disabilities  allowing themto fully participate in the development efforts of theirrespective societies.I would like to conclude in the same vein as Ibegan — by emphatically reaffirming the faith thatMali has in the United Nations  whose purposes andprinciples  set out almost 60 years ago  remain deeplymeaningful and highly relevant. It is true that recentlythe Organization’s capacity and credibility have beenseriously undermined. It is therefore all the moreimportant that we carry out a thorough reform of theOrganization and revitalize its main bodies. Maliwelcomes the important progress that has beenachieved in the context of the revitalization of the workof the General Assembly. The reorganization of thework of the Main Committees  the strengthening of therole of the Bureau and the improvement in workingmethods will certainly result in the greatereffectiveness of this important body. I would like topay tribute  Sir  to your predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte for the remarkable work that he accomplished in thatrespect.18Mali shares the common African position thatSecurity Council reform is a necessary — indeed  apriority — task if we are to strengthen the capacitiesand the credibility of that important body. The Councilmust be more representative and legitimate. Itscomposition should reflect the realities of today’sworld and be expanded in both categories ofmembership  with particular account being taken of therepresentation of Africa.The people of the world have placed their hope inthe United Nations  and they expect  in return  greaterpeace  security  democracy  development and solidarity.As the community of nations  we have the means toachieve those goals  thanks to our collective awarenessand the safeguarding of the values we all share:democracy  respect for the rule of law  the primacy ofhuman rights  the preservation of the environment andthe protection of future generations from the scourge ofwar."
"116",4676,"MLT",59,2004,"I would like first tocongratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession. You have an important and challenging taskahead. In executing your duties you can be assured ofmy full support and that of the Maltese delegation.I take this opportunity to express our appreciationto the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session  His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte. Overthe last twelve months he has successfully guided theAssemblyís work with exemplary dedication andinitiative.I would also like  at the outset of my interventionthis afternoon  to take the opportunity to express thesolidarity of the Maltese people with those countriesand people who have suffered loss of life and damageto property as a result of the recent spate of hurricanesand tropical storms  particularly the people of Haiti.We  the Maltese people  pledge our support in this hourof need.It is a source of particular satisfaction for me toaddress the Assembly for the first time as PrimeMinister of Malta  and also for Malta in its new role asa member of the European Union. The President of theUnionís Council of Ministers  the Foreign Minister ofthe Netherlands  has already laid before the Assemblythe objectives and priorities of the 25 members of theUnion for the coming months.The upholding and development of internationallaw and effective multilateralism are central to theEuropean Unionís external actions. The role of theUnited Nations is vital in this regard. Malta hasconsistently supported the view that the internationalcommunity needs this universal forum within which itcan collectively deliberate and act upon the manyproblems that confront it. Our membership in theEuropean Union gives renewed scope and addeddimension to our commitment to the United Nationsand its role in international affairs.Recent events have raised urgent questions aboutthe extent to which the United Nations is fulfilling therole envisaged for it under the Charter. Inevitably thisleads to some serious concerns about the effectivenessof our Organization. Nevertheless  the questions whichhave been raised do not diminish the case not only forits continued existence but also for its strengthening asa world body. As we survey the latest developments incrises spots around the globe  the realization intensifiesthat solutions to the major problems of our age arebeyond the grasp and control of any single nation orparticular group of nations  however powerful anddetermined.The international system is itself frequentlyoverwhelmed by the immensity and complexity of manyof the problems it faces. The United Nations is indeed atthe forefront of action in the most critical areas -furthering development  relieving suffering  safeguardinghuman rights  combating terrorism  fightingenvironmental degradation  fostering sustainability resolving conflicts  promoting peace and disarmamentand upholding the rule of international law.Each year we derive a measure of comfort fromthe knowledge that some progress is being recorded incertain areas. In this yearís report the Secretary-General mentions last Julyís Framework Agreementthat put the Doha Round of trade negotiations back ontrack; he refers to the contribution that United Nationspeace missions are making towards the gradualimprovement of the situation in Liberia  Sierra Leone Somalia and the Central African Republic  as well as inAfghanistan  Papua New Guinea  Guatemala and Haiti.He records the launching of an important newprogramme in the fight against HIV/AIDS; he notesthat for the second consecutive year the global refugeefigure has decreased by nearly 1 million  and hebelieves that meeting the Millennium DevelopmentGoals by the target date of 2015 remains achievable.At the same time  however  the Secretary-Generalhighlights a bewildering array of areas on which novisible progress can be registered  in spite of the factthat  as the Secretary-General reminds us  there are atpresent more than 56 000 uniformed personnel andsome 11 000 civilian staff from 97 countries serving in16 United Nations missions worldwide  and in spite ofthe fact that the whole United Nations system including the specialized agencies  is wholeheartedlyengaged in the work of promoting economic and socialprogress and development.The humanitarian crisis in Darfur  in westernSudan  is one stark manifestation of an apparentlyunbridgeable gap between intention and execution. Thedaily visions on television screens throughout theworld of thousands of refugees suffering and dying15overwhelm the impact that a steady but slowdiplomacy may be making in its own right. In Iraq  inPalestine and in Israel  the fact that in those difficultrealities hardly a single day goes by without news ofpeople dying violently in armed actions is in sharpcontrast with the limited reports on continuing effortsto find peaceful and viable solutions. Silently  acrossour globe of plenty with its advanced technology  thefact remains that in spite of our collective effortsmillions of individuals  many of them children continue to suffer and die in conditions of absolutepoverty  malnutrition and disease.Over the next 12 months two events will providea special opportunity for the United Nationsmembership to focus on the key issues that challengethe vitality and effectiveness of our Organization. TheHigh-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change appointed by the Secretary-General last year  will soonproduce its report. The Secretary-General expects thatthe Panel  after examining the threats we face andevaluating our existing policies  processes andinstitutions  will make bold and practicablerecommendations. It will be up to us as Member States collectively and individually  to be equally bold andpractical in responding to those recommendations.The Panelís report will be followed in 2005 by ahigh-level meeting on the five-year review of theMillennium Declaration  as well as the commemorationof the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. Fiveyears after what was expected to be the dawn of a newera  the time will be ripe for some dramatic results toemerge  not least at the institutional level.High on the agenda in this context is the reformof the Security Council. As currently constituted  theCouncil suffers from three noticeable weaknesses.First  it has limited means of adequately addressing thedevelopment issues involved in security matters.Secondly  the regional distribution of authority in theCouncil is severely lopsided. And  thirdly  the greatmajority of Member States  especially the smaller ones are underrepresented in the deliberations of theCouncil. Urgent remedies need to be found for all theseweaknesses for the Council to be able to continue toplay a relevant role in the twenty-first century.In its turn  the General Assembly needs to greatlyintensify current efforts to enhance the strengthsinherent in its universality  while discarding thedebilitating and time-consuming procedures andworking methods that such universality has bred. Themajor organs and specialized agencies of the UnitedNations system also need to devise improved ways ofharmonizing  through the Economic and Social Council their many impressive  but often disparate  efforts tofoster sustainable social and economic development.One of the underlying strengths of the UnitedNations system lies in the manner in which it permitsaction at the regional level to insert itself into globalefforts towards peace  security and cooperation. In recentyears  the progressive strengthening of the African Unionhas added a welcome partner to the regional framework in what is  unfortunately  the region of greatest need.The recently enlarged European Union has alsobeen progressively enhancing its cooperation with theUnited Nations at both the regional and higher levels.The Secretary-General refers in his report on the workof the Organization (A/59/1) to the significant progress inEU/United Nations cooperation on conflict prevention peace-building and post-conflict reconstruction  as wellas in crisis management activities.One area in which the EU and the United Nationsare active and important partners concerns the questionof Palestine. As members of the Quartet  the EU andthe United Nations play a significant role by injecting amuch-needed balance and objectivity into an issuetormented by violence and passion. Both the EU andthe United Nations are by right major stakeholders inthe issue. History and geographical proximity underpinthe special interest of all EU member States in theprosperity and well-being of both Israelis andPalestinians. The creation and peaceful coexistence oftwo neighbouring States  Israel and Palestine  was oneof the United Nations very first  but unfortunately stillunfulfilled  recommendations.After decades of bitterness and wrong turns  theissue of Palestine remains jeopardized by the forces ofextremism and intransigence. But extremism andintransigence ó as manifested by both the perpetratorsof Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli advocatesof a continuing and forceful military occupation ofPalestinian territories - do have a counterbalance onboth sides  as manifested by the Geneva Initiative oflate last year  among many other examples. The EUand the United Nations need to continuously exert theirinfluence and pressure on both sides to persuade themto give greater heed and credibility to the voices ofreason which lie in their midst.16The path to legality and reconciliation has beendefined in the road map  in the many resolutions of theSecurity Council and the General Assembly and  mostrecently  in the advisory opinion of the InternationalCourt of Justice. Even in the face of constant setbackson the ground  the EU and United Nations Quartetpartners need to remain steadfast in their insistencethat the road to peace can only be set within thoseparameters.Malta looks at the problem both from its tragichumanitarian dimension as well as from its far-reaching implications for peace and security. Oneimportant concern for us in that regard is the impactthat the problem has on issues of peace and security inthe Middle East in general and the Mediterranean areain particular.One of the primary objectives of the EuropeanUnion is to promote the development  throughpartnership  of a common zone of peace  prosperity andprogress in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Inrecent months the Union has elaborated a policyagenda for that strategic partnership linking together anumber of instruments and mechanisms that have beenput in place over the years. The Euro-MediterraneanPartnership - the Barcelona or Euromed process - andthe European Neighbourhood Policy are the frameworksof that policy. A key element in the EU approach is theparallel importance assigned to the processes ofsecurity-building and to cooperation in the social economic  cultural and humanitarian fields. In that wayit ensures that the evolving relationships in the Euro-Mediterranean area are tailored to the specific concernsand needs of the individual countries and regions.For the Balkan region  the framework providedby the European Neighbourhood Policy ó and theprospect of consolidating relationships with theEuropean Union which it implies ó constitutes animportant contributory factor towards growth andstability. With the exception of the situation in Kosovo which remains disturbing  and some other examples progress in the Balkan region is encouraging.The almost decade-long EuroMed process hasgradually but steadily put into place a useful structurefor the strengthening and consolidation of relationshipsamong the countries of the Mediterranean. It not onlycontributes to the economic and social development ofindividual countries  but also provides a stablebackground in which some of the wider problems may betackled  taking into account the strong linkage thatexists between security and cooperation in Europe andin the Mediterranean. It needs strengthening andbroadening  and in that context  the participation ofLibya in the Barcelona Euromed process would beparticularly welcome.One such issue concerns the question ofmigration from the southern to the northern shores ofthe Mediterranean. As in other parts of the world  thatissue needs to be tackled from the economic  social andpolitical  as well as the humanitarian  perspective.Because of its geographical location and small size Malta has a special sensitivity to the many problemsand complexities of the issue. We are hopeful that thespirit of cooperation and understanding provided by theEuroMed process can help countries in our region tosuccessfully tackle the challenges involved.Over the last few months  an importantdevelopment took place in our region in the context ofdisarmament. Libyaís decision to renounce itsprogramme of weapons of mass destruction has beenwelcomed by all. As a longstanding friend and closeneighbour of Libya  Malta has particular reasons towelcome this development and the increasedopportunities it now creates for Libya to play asignificant role in the process of Euro-Mediterraneansecurity and cooperation.It is reasonable to argue that the framework ofregional stability and cooperation provided by theEuro-Mediterranean process was one factor thatcontributed to Libyaís decision to renounce itsprogramme. Nevertheless  problems relating to thedevelopment of weapons of mass destruction still existin other regions of the world. The role that can beplayed by initiatives encouraging regional stability andeconomic and social development in the resolution ofthese problems should not be underestimated.We must also look at the problems raised by thethreat of new weapons of mass destruction as part ofthe wider issue of disarmament in its many aspects.The continuing commitment to the major multilateraltreaties and increased efforts to intensify measures ofverification and compliance are of paramount importancein this regard. Equally important is the need to bring theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty into forcewithout further delay.The problem of the proliferation of weapons especially weapons of mass destruction  has in our day17assumed a new and frightening dimension in itspossible linkage with terrorism. In this regard  as theSecretary-General points out  the effectiveimplementation of Security Council resolution 1540(2004)  adopted earlier this year  should complementongoing efforts to strengthen existing multilateral andnon-proliferation regimes.The fight against terrorism involves all of us andneeds to be pursued with firmness and tenacity. At thesame time  the struggle must take place on our termsand not those of the terrorists. As the Secretary-General takes every opportunity to remind us  thisstruggle must not take place at the expense of thefundamental freedoms and basic dignity of individuals neither must we allow the legitimate concern toeradicate terrorism in all its aspects to distract thecommitment of the global community in its endeavourtowards the economic and social development of theless advantaged regions of the world.In conclusion  our concerns for the safety of ourpeople must be counter-balanced by the assurances thatthose responsible for these threats will be dealt with bya coherent and effective system of trans-frontier justicethat reflects respect for the rule of law. Theinternational communityís endeavours in recent yearshave found fruition in the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court  a functioning institutionthat increases its effectiveness the more widely all themembers of the family of nations subscribe to it.In encouraging reflection on these topical issues I feel confident in the credentials offered by mycountry  whose level of commitment to the UnitedNations certainly makes up for any physical limitationswe may have. Malta has been instrumental indeveloping the concept of common heritage  in relationboth to the high seas and to climate change  and wehave emphasized the importance of intergenerationalsolidarity  as evidenced not only by our initiatives onageing but also as the host country for the InternationalInstitute on Ageing.As in previous years  the issues before of theGeneral Assembly are many and complex. The densityand variety of the agenda we have before us are both achallenge and an opportunity for our Organization. Itrust that under your able guidance  Mr. President  wewill find the energy and wisdom to meet thesechallenges and exploit these opportunities. Humanity iscounting on all of us."
"117",4722,"MMR",59,2004,"Allow me  first of all to congratulate the President on his assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession. I am fully confident that his wisdom anddiplomatic skills will guide our deliberations to afruitful outcome. I would also like to take thisopportunity to convey my appreciation to Mr. JulianHunte for his able leadership and contributions to thesuccess of the previous session. My delegation wouldalso like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for hisselfless dedication to the cause of the United Nations.The world today faces many daunting challenges.Most ominous and threatening among them are issuesrelated to peace and security. Under thosecircumstances  it is worth recalling the Five Principlesof Peaceful Coexistence  which were enunciated 50years ago by Myanmar  along with China and India  toprovide the basic principles for inter-State relations.The Principles were subsequently adopted by Asianand African leaders in the Bandung Declaration of1955. The 1961 Belgrade Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement also adopted the Principles as basictenets of the Movement. The United Nations itselfendorsed the Principles. Founded on the premise of theessential unity of humankind  the Five Principlesremain as relevant and valid today as on the day theywere proclaimed.Myanmar considers the United Nations  whichrepresents international legitimacy and near-universalmembership  as the sole multilateral forum foraddressing urgent global issues. Recent events remindus of the futility of unilateralism and the danger ofresorting to the use of force without the authorizationof the United Nations.Threats to the international system and therapidly evolving international situation demand athorough reform of the Organization and itsmechanisms  structure and working methods. In thatcontext  we would like to reiterate our views on thereform of the Organization  including that of theSecurity Council. The expansion and reform of theSecurity Council must be an integral part of a commonpackage. If it is to become more representative andreflect contemporary political and economic realities the Council should be expanded in both categories ofmembership. An ideal solution in the democratizationprocess would be the abolition of the veto. Until that isdone  its application should be limited. It is also ourview that new permanent members of the SecurityCouncil should enjoy the same rights and privileges ascurrent members.Myanmar notes with interest the ongoing work ofthe Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change.In this highly globalized world  regionalcooperation  including South-South cooperation  canwell complement international cooperation. As amember of the Association of South-East AsianNations  Myanmar is actively involved in theAssociation’s activities aimed at promoting regional13peace  stability and prosperity and at enhancingcooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.Terrorism is one of the most serious challengesthat the world faces today. It threatens nationalsovereignty and violates human rights  including theright to life. Last year  terrorists carried their war to thedoorstep of the United Nations. They cruellyextinguished the lives of 22 innocent persons including that of Special Representative Sergio Vieirade Mello  at United Nations headquarters in Baghdad.More recently  we have seen wanton acts of terrorismin diverse parts of the world  from Beslan to Jakarta toMadrid. Myanmar unequivocally condemns terrorismin all its forms and manifestations and joins theinternational community in calling for concerted actionto combat the menace in accordance with the UnitedNations Charter and international law.We have never permitted the use of our territoryfor hostile acts against any State. We have neitherprovided assistance to those involved in terrorist actsnor safe haven to them  and we never will.Myanmar is doing its utmost to combat thismenace at the national  regional and internationallevels. Myanmar has signed  or acceded to  11 of the 12international legal instruments related to thesuppression of terrorism. It is also actively involved inthe Bali Process to combat transnational crime including international terrorism.The illicit trafficking in drugs is anotherchallenge that is closely linked to other transnationalcrimes. Success in the war against drugs will contributeto a successful outcome in the fight againsttransnational crime. Myanmar accords topmost priorityto the suppression and eradication of narcotic drugs. A15-year national plan is targeted at the eradication ofnarcotic drugs in the country by the year 2014. In thelast decade  Myanmar seized and destroyed drugsvalued at more than $14.5 billion.Figures from the United States Drug EnforcementAdministration show that over a span of eight years from 1996 to 2003  poppy cultivation declined steadily by 71 per cent  while opium production decreased by81 per cent. The United Nations Office on Drugs andCrime has acknowledged Myanmar’s commitment tothe anti-drug campaign.In recent years the problem of synthetic drugs hasalso surfaced. The illicit drugs chain begins withinadequate control of the trade in precursor chemicals.It bears repetition that my country does not produceprecursor chemicals used in the production of narcoticdrugs. We would like to urge countries that produceprecursor chemicals to institute effective regulatorycontrols. Without precursor chemicals there can be noamphetamine-type synthetic drugs.Myanmar is determined in its fight against drugs.It has established bilateral  trilateral  regional andmultilateral cooperation to rid the world of thisscourge.Some Western countries allege that Myanmar isnot adequately addressing the issue of trafficking inpersons. Nothing could be further from the truth. Infact  Myanmar views trafficking in persons as an evilthat must be suppressed through concerted action. Inthat connection  Myanmar acceded to the UnitedNations Convention against Transnational OrganizedCrime on 30 March of this year. A national law againsthuman trafficking is being drafted in accordance withthat Convention. Next month  Myanmar will host themeeting of the six-nation Coordinated MekongMinisterial Initiative against Trafficking.Allegations of human rights violations inMyanmar are aimed at discrediting the Government forpolitical purposes. Myanmar believes that the questionof human rights is an important issue. It should beaddressed with objectivity and impartiality  andwithout selectivity. Myanmar has consistentlycooperated with the United Nations on human rightsissues. In that context  a national Human RightsCommittee has already been established and humanrights awareness is being introduced in school curriculanationwide  as well as through workshops.An interview conducted by a politicallymotivated non-governmental organization with 25 orso insurgents inside a neighbouring country became thebasis of a report that there are 70 000 child soldiers inthe Myanmar national armed forces. That is a far-fetched conclusion. The falsehood found its way intothe report of the Secretary-General on children andarmed conflict in 2002 (S/2002/1299). The reportsubsequently became the resource document in theSecurity Council’s ensuing thematic debate on childrenand armed conflict.I wish  first of all  to firmly reiterate thatMyanmar is not a nation in armed conflict. It is anation at peace. Secondly  I wish to clearly state that14children not permitted to be recruited into the armedservices in Myanmar  either by law or in practice. Apreventive programme was in place in my country evenbefore Security Council resolutions were adopted onthis theme. In that regard  the Chairman of ourCommittee on the Prevention of the Recruitment ofChild Soldiers recently received the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF) representative in Myanmarto explore ways and means to enhance cooperation.The representative was afforded the opportunity to visitthe army recruitment centre near Yangon  andsubsequently the army recruitment centre in Mandalaytogether with the United Nations Resident Coordinator.Myanmar is finalizing an action plan and iscooperating with UNICEF in that regard. It will alsocontinue its cooperation with the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Childrenand Armed Conflict.Allow me to turn to developments in my country.Peace and stability have been restored. We are takingsteps to ensure a smooth transition to a peaceful democratic modern State. Myanmar places the highestpriority on national reconciliation to achieve unityamong its 135 national races. In order to strengthen tiesand promote the economic and social development ofthe national races inhabiting the border areas  theGovernment has expended 58 billion kyats and morethan $550 million in infrastructure development thatincludes communication networks and education andhealth facilities  thus promoting the quality of life ofthose citizens.Notwithstanding the unilateral sanctions of someWestern countries  Myanmar has been able to developits economy and promote the well-being of its people.We have achieved this by relying mainly on our ownresources  and with the assistance and cooperation ofour neighbours.Noteworthy advances have been made in thehealth and education sectors. The country now has 757hospitals  with 140 hospitals having been added in thelast 15 years. In the past year alone  22 new hospitalswere commissioned. Over the same period  the numberof colleges and universities in the country hasincreased from 32 to 154. Enrolment has risendramatically in those institutions  from 120 000 to890 000 students.The President returned to the Chair.Allow me now to turn to recent politicaldevelopments in my country. In August 2003  thePrime Minister  General Khin Nyunt  announced aseven-step road map for transition to democracy. Theroad map has been well received in the country  as wellas by our neighbours. The Association of SoutheastAsian Nations (ASEAN) Summit last Novemberwelcomed the commitment of the MyanmarGovernment to effect a transition to democracy.The first and most crucial step of the road map the reconvening of the National Convention  was takenon 17 May of this year. The current Convention isbeing attended by 1 088 delegates from eight strata representing all walks of life. It is more inclusive thanthe previous Convention  which was attended by onlyabout 700 delegates.Moreover  60 per cent of the delegates to thecurrent Convention are from the national races. Over100 delegates represent 17 major armed groups and 17smaller armed groups  which have returned to the legalfold. In the previous Convention  representatives ofthree or four armed groups which had just returned tothe legal fold were present as observers.During the first session  the sensitive issue ofpower-sharing between the central Government and thestates and regions was the main focus of discussion.Indeed  power-sharing is a vital and delicate issue  asthe country is now evolving from a unitaryGovernment structure to a union structure  where statesand regions will have their own executive andlegislative bodies. Delegates held extensive discussionson that issue. Because of the complex and sensitivenature of the deliberations  discussions were time-consuming and sometimes intense. After a successfulfirst session  the Convention adjourned on 9 July.Myanmar is a union of 135 national races  andunity is key to achieving our vision of a prosperousdemocratic State. We are greatly encouraged by theresults of the first session. The common desire toensure the success of the seven-step road map wasevident. Preparations are under way for the secondsession  which is to be convened in the forthcomingopen season. Once agreement is reached on thefundamental principles in the National Convention  anew constitution will be drafted. The draft text will beput to a referendum for the people of Myanmar todecide upon. After the adoption of the new15constitution  there will be free and fair elections  inwhich the people will elect leaders of their choice.The new political structure needs to be strong andresilient  and the country united. The future of thenation cannot be determined by one individual or oneparty acting alone. There is no alternative to theNational Convention. It is the sole process throughwhich the aspirations of the people of Myanmar toestablish a modern and democratic nation can befulfilled. We cannot allow the National Convention tobe derailed under any circumstances. Failure wouldplunge the nation into the abyss of anarchy. That is thereason why we set such store on the successfuloutcome of the National Convention. We aredetermined that this vital national endeavour will becrowned with success."
"118",4779,"MNG",59,2004,"Iwish to extend to you  Sir  my delegation’s warmestcongratulations on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I amconfident that  under your stewardship  this sessionwill successfully accomplish its mission.The outgoing year has been a challenging time asthe international community has grappled with a hostof formidable challenges  including terrorist attacks the threat of proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  violent internal conflicts  the surge ofinfectious diseases and natural disasters  in addition topersisting poverty and hunger and humanitarianemergencies.Moreover  the war in Iraq and its aftermath havehad a lasting impact on the fabric of internationalaffairs in the Middle East and the world over. Thebitter divisions that it engendered over how to ensureour collective security against terror and the threat ofproliferation of weapons of mass destruction haveposed a challenge and a test for the United Nations. Itis gratifying to see that  in these difficult times  theworld Organization has been able to regain its validityas the indispensable common house of the entirehuman family.To make the United Nations a more effectiveinstrument for pursuing all the priorities identified inthe Millennium Declaration  world leaders pledgedtheir resolve to undertake a set of bold measures toreform the world Organization so as to enable it toadequately address the manifold challenges ahead. Thetask of reforming the United Nations will undoubtedlyrequire truly innovative approaches and the unfalteringcommitment of Member States. In that respect  mydelegation eagerly awaits the report of the High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change  and ensuingrecommendations by the Secretary-General to besubmitted to the General Assembly later this year.31In the meantime  my delegation highly commendsthe hard work and tireless efforts of Mr. Julian Hunte President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession. Resolutions 58/126 and 58/316  adopted underhis skilful leadership  have proved to be by far themost far-reaching actions in recent years. Significant asthey are  we should nevertheless aim higher and workwith vigour to further reaffirm the central position ofthe General Assembly as the chief deliberative  policy-making and representative organ of the United Nationsand to enable it to play that role more effectively.On Security Council reform  I wish to joinprevious speakers in reiterating that its compositionhas long ceased to reflect current geopolitical realities.Mongolia reaffirms its support for a just and equitableenlargement of the Security Council by increasing thenumber of permanent and non-permanent seats  whileensuring the representation of developing anddeveloped countries. In that regard  my Governmentsupports the legitimate aspirations of such countries asJapan  Germany and India that are willing and able toshoulder greater responsibility in pursuit ofinternational peace  security and development.Permanent seats  in our view  should also be allocatedto Latin America and Africa. We do not  however  seekenlargement for its own sake — the expanded SecurityCouncil must be fully equipped to effectively react tothe crises and conflicts of the new millennium. It isalso our view that the veto power ought to bethoroughly reviewed  and efforts should be exerted tomake the Council more democratic by enhancing itsaccountability and the transparency of its work.There appears to be a broad consensus emergingthat next year’s high-level meeting to review theimplementation of the Millennium Development Goalsand the celebrations for the sixtieth anniversary of theUnited Nations will galvanize us into making boldplans for the future — plans that will enable the familyof nations to attain the ambitious  but achievable  goalsset by the Millennium Declaration through a genuinedisplay of solidarity  shared responsibility and effectivepartnership.In his address to the Assembly last week theSecretary-General eloquently underscored the need touphold the rule of law on both the international anddomestic levels. Mongolia firmly believes that the ruleof law and multilateralism are the fundamentalprinciples of international relations in the twenty-firstcentury. We must not falter or fail in pursuing them.The value of international law — the only viableframework of rules to govern the behaviour andinteraction among States — must never be rated on itsperformance in the short term or for its ability toachieve near-sighted goals  nor should the value ofdialogue and collective decision-making be called intoquestion. Violation of those principles  even with thebest of intentions  is dangerous. Let us remember thatthe road to hell is paved with good intentions. Suchactions would only bring about unforeseen andunintended effects that in the long term could beextremely harmful to established internationalmechanisms and processes and endanger the existingworld order. That simple truth applies to every aspectof international life from the war on terror and themaintenance of peace and security to the managementof international trade and environmental protection.Indeed  any unlawful act  once committed  willcertainly have far greater repercussions than imaginedat the outset — repercussions that will ultimatelyundermine its original objectives.The persistent instability of some regions of theworld and the people who suffer from internal armedconflicts represent the failure of world leaders toenforce the commitment they undertook in theMillennium Declaration to “spare no effort to free ourpeoples from the scourge of war  whether within orbetween States”. The violence and hatred that spreadacross the Darfur region of Sudan is one such tragicexample.In the Middle East  Mongolia notes with sadnessthe lack of progress on the path towards the peacefulresolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We urgeboth sides to exercise utmost restraint  and support theefforts of the Quartet to ensure the implementation ofthe road map.Mongolia is also concerned with the securitysituation in Iraq. The end of occupation and the formalrestoration of Iraqi sovereignty on 28 June 2004 werelaudable achievements  yet the persisting climate ofviolence and insecurity threatens to undermine theefforts of the international community to bring peace security and stability to that country. Mongoliawholeheartedly supports the political process based onSecurity Council resolutions 1483 (2003) and 1546(2004)  and the actions undertaken by the interimGovernment to convene a national conference  createan interim council and hold elections early next year.32In Afghanistan  the approaching presidential andparliamentary elections are important milestones for anew  democratic State. The registration of more than 10million voters  a significant portion of whom arewomen  clearly demonstrates the strong determinationof the Afghan people to rebuild their country.Continued engagement of the international communityremains crucial in maintaining peace and stability inAfghanistan and promoting the Bonn process.The Korean nuclear crisis  and the resultingtensions on the Korean peninsula  cast dark clouds overall of North-East Asia. As a North-East Asian nationthat rejects nuclear arms  Mongolia stands for anuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula and sees it as animportant condition for the reconciliation of bothKoreas and  therefore  for the peace and stability of theregion. The continuation of the six-party talks towardsa negotiated solution is of vital importance for themaintenance of peace and stability both on the Koreanpeninsula and in the region as a whole.Indeed  strengthening international peace andsecurity by supporting practical disarmament measuresin every possible way has been one of the mainpriorities of Mongolia’s foreign policy. TheInternational Campaign to Ban Landmines and effortsto curb the illicit trade in small arms and light weaponshave an immediate bearing on human security andsocial and economic development around the world.As an ardent advocate of the disarmament ofweapons of mass destruction  and  in particular  nucleardisarmament  Mongolia believes that the full andeffective implementation of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by both thenuclear and the non-nuclear weapon States will play apivotal role in promoting international peace andnuclear security. In that context  Mongolia welcomesSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004)  adoptedunanimously under Chapter VII of the Charter of theUnited Nations  as a meaningful step towards curbingthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.However  we also believe that another significant stepneeds to be made towards nuclear disarmament: theearly entry into force and universalization on a prioritybasis of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.The establishment of new and consolidation ofexisting nuclear-weapon-free zones should remain highon the international agenda. My Government willcontinue its efforts towards institutionalizing itsnuclear-weapon-free status at the international level.Mongolia’s internationally recognized and legallybinding nuclear-weapon-free status could furthercontribute towards ensuring peace and stability in theregion of North-East Asia and beyond.The global war on terror remains high on theagenda of the international community. The11 September attacks heralded the start of anunprecedented global campaign that united countries large and small  in their resolve to stand together tocombat terrorism.And yet  despite the efforts of the internationalcommunity  terrorism — like the Hydra of Lerna —seems to grow a new head for each one it loses.The current year has been no exception to thatsad pattern and civilians continue to be the target ofattacks: in Iraq  both Iraqi and foreign nationals havebeen targeted; in Madrid  an attack was perpetratedagainst a commuter train; and  in the RussianFederation  there have been a string of attacks  thelatest being the school massacre in Beslan  wherechildren fell victim to an unprecedented atrocity.Those events have highlighted once again theneed for an effective international anti-terroristcampaign. The United Nations plays a central role inthe fight against terror  coordinating the actions of itsMember States and providing them with technical andlegislative support. Mongolia supports the efforts ofthe Counter-Terrorism Committee aimed at itsrevitalization  and is looking forward to seeing theCounter-Terrorism Executive Directorate in operation.We also attach importance to the speedy finalization ofdraft international conventions on terrorism andnuclear terrorism currently in progress.No matter how pressing the fight is against terror it should not overshadow other issues that impact thedaily lives of millions of people — from extremepoverty and hunger  to environmental degradation andHIV/AIDS  to health and education. The growingdevelopment disparity between rich and poor countries;increasing poverty and unemployment in thedeveloping world  particularly in the least developedcountries; the burden of debt and trade inequalities areof growing concern to us. We feel that developmentitself is an effective remedy for the root cause of thosesocial ills  and thus attach particular importance to theimplementation  at the national  regional andinternational levels  of the goals agreed to at the33Millennium Summit and in Monterrey  Johannesburgand Rome.In this context  my delegation welcomes the NewYork Declaration on the Action Against Hunger andPoverty adopted on 20 September this year at thehighest political level  which is aimed at fostering ourcommon fight to overcome poverty and increasefinancing for development.Mongolia welcomes the adoption by the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) members of the negotiatingframework for the Doha trade round last July. This isof particular importance since the Doha DevelopmentAgenda provides significant opportunities foreconomic development and fair trade. We continue tofavour special and differentiated treatment fordeveloping countries  especially those with small andvulnerable economies whose populations are largelydependent for their livelihoods on being granted fullmarket access and low import tariffs by the majortrading partners.One year from now  world leaders will meet hereat the summit level to review progress in theimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.In preparation for this important event  Mongolia hasproduced its first national report on the implementationof the Goals.In recent years  the world has witnessed theemergence of a new global commitment to democracyand good governance. A little over a year ago Mongolia hosted the Fifth International Conference ofNew or Restored Democracies  which had the principaltheme of democracy  good governance and civilsociety. Mongolia is now actively engaged in ensuringan effective follow-up to the conference bothnationally and internationally.In this respect  my delegation wishes to commendthe proposal by the President of the United Statesaimed at establishing a democracy fund at the UnitedNations to help countries to lay the foundations ofdemocracy by instituting the rule of law  theindependence of the judiciary  a free press  a multipartysystem and trade unions. This fund would help supportour endeavours to strengthen democracy and goodgovernance and to develop an effective partnershipwith civil society in the implementation of theMillennium Development Goals.This year  Mongolians have participated in theirfourth parliamentary election. During the election  thetwo main political parties in our country  theMotherland-Democracy Coalition and the MongolianPeople’s Revolutionary Party  won almost an equalnumber of seats in the Parliament. The two politicalparties have agreed to form a coalition Government onthe basis of consensus-building  thereby demonstratingthat democratic principles and values have firmly takenroot in Mongolian soil. I have no doubt that the newcoalition Government will wish to strengthendemocracy and good governance  ensure sustainedeconomic growth  reduce poverty and unemployment and pursue a foreign policy that is open  multifacetedand proactive."
"119",4820,"MOZ",59,2004,"Mr. President on behalf of the people and the Government of theRepublic of Mozambique  I would like to congratulateyou upon your election as President of the fifty-ninthsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations.We are delighted to see a distinguished son of Africa inthe stewardship of the highest organ of the UnitedNations  which shows the confidence the world placeson your experience  wisdom and proven skills. Let mealso pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Julian Robert Hunte  Minister forExternal Affairs  International Trade and Civil Aviationof Saint Lucia  for successfully having presided overone of the most productive sessions of the GeneralAssembly.I wish to commend the Secretary-General for hiscontinued devotion to the fundamental ideals of ourOrganization  stressing the importance ofmultilateralism  with a view to addressing the globalchallenges before us  such as to eradicate poverty hunger  pandemic diseases and illiteracy and to bringabout development  peace and stability.I speak before this Assembly at a time whenMozambique is preparing to conduct its third multi-party general elections  to be held on1 and 2 December 2004.Having had the privilege of leading my countrythrough many challenges  moving from war to peace from destruction to reconstruction  from economicdecline to economic growth and development  I felt Ishould allow other elected sons and daughters ofMozambique the opportunity to take up the noble taskof conducting the affairs of the nation  leading tofurther gains. This is therefore my very last attendanceof a session of the General Assembly in my capacity asHead of State and Government.After the elections  I will join civil society andcontinue to make my humble contribution to the effortson the prevailing challenges still facing Mozambique Africa and the world  particularly in the areas of peaceand the promotion of cultural  social and economicdevelopment.5I have been attending sessions of the GeneralAssembly since 1975  first in my capacity as Ministerfor Foreign Affairs and then as President ofMozambique. I cherish every moment I have spent hereat the United Nations  as part of the global efforts tocollectively find solutions to the problems around theworld. It has been  indeed  quite a rewardingexperience as  through our common resolve  we havebeen able to successfully advance the decolonizationprocess in Africa and elsewhere  while engaging in thestruggle for peace and stability  poverty eradication anddevelopment.As I depart  allow me to share some reflectionson the role played by our universal Organization  theUnited Nations. Reaffirming the inalienable right of allpeoples to self-determination and independence  inaccordance with the principles and objectives set forthin the Charter of the United Nations and GeneralAssembly resolution 1514 (XV)  Mozambique attainedits independence from colonial rule in 1975. Sincethen  the country has been actively involved in theUnited Nations  has progressively improved itsrelations with the Organization and its related bodiesand has received strong  multidisciplinary support.Since then  60 territories worldwide have becomedecolonized  and millions of people today are able toexercise their right to self-determination.It was on 16 September 1975 that  for the firsttime  I had the privilege of addressing the GeneralAssembly from this rostrum. I was then the ForeignMinister of my country  and I was expressing thegratitude of the people and the Government ofMozambique for our admission as a Member of theUnited Nations.When Mozambique was admitted  the UnitedNations was composed of 144 Member States compared to 191 in 2004. That shows the extent of thegrowth of our Organization. In Africa  countries suchas Angola  Zimbabwe  Namibia  South Africa andWestern Sahara were not yet independent or wereunder apartheid domination. On other continents  thesituation was very similar.The cold war was at its peak and the arms racewas a dominant feature of international politics. Thefocus of the Non-Aligned Movement was onadvocating the interests of the developing countries  onraising international awareness of the dangers and risksof a nuclear confrontation and on the struggle for theestablishment of a new international economic order.In those days of high political tensions  internationaldialogue was characterized by confrontation andintolerance. Today  international dialogue is more oneof consultation and the search for consensus. Theconstructive dialogue existing among Africa and theGroup of Eight  the European Union  the Associationof Southeast Asian Nations  the South AmericanCommon Market (MERCOSUR) and other regionalgroupings are good examples of the prevailing newinternational political mood. Throughout this process the United Nations has played an important role.Soon after its independence  my country had toface the economic and social consequences stemmingfrom its decision to close its border with SouthernRhodesia  in compliance with a United Nationsresolution that imposed sanctions on that neighbouringTerritory. It was a costly measure  but because itachieved its aim of ending the illegal regime in thatTerritory  we feel proud to have taken that action.During that period  Mozambique enjoyedimportant support from the United Nations  particularlyin the areas of health  education  rural development advocacy and emergency assistance for the victims ofwar and natural disasters.Following many years of a destabilizing war  theGovernment and the Mozambique National Resistance(RENAMO)  the former guerrilla group  signed theGeneral Peace Agreement on 4 October 1992. Soonafter the signing of the Agreement  the SecurityCouncil approved the establishment of the UnitedNations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ) tomonitor and verify its implementation.We deeply appreciate the resolute and decisiveinvolvement of the United Nations in the peaceprocess  with the mobilization of human  material andfinancial resources. That strong support from theinternational community  combined with our peopleíswill and determination to achieve peace  led to whatmany regard as the first example of a successful UnitedNations peacekeeping mission in Africa.During the last 12 years of peace  our country hasbenefited from considerable support from the UnitedNations and its various specialized bodies forreconstruction and development activities. Thatsupport has been critical for economic growth and thegradual improvement of the peopleís living conditions.6In 2000  unprecedented floods devastatedMozambique. Those floods affected the central andsouthern parts of the country  causing heavy losses ofhuman lives and infrastructure. Again  the response ofthe United Nations and the international community tothe disaster was commendable. We take thisopportunity to reiterate our gratitude to both the UnitedNations and the international community in general fortheir unconditional support  without which the lossescould have been heavier.As a result of sound economic and social policiesand an enabling political environment  we have beenable to record encouraging progress. The absolutepoverty rate decreased from 69.5 per cent in 1997 to54.1 per cent in 2003. From 1997 to 2003  real averagegross domestic product growth was 8 per cent.We wish to recognize the critical role played byour development partners in assisting our country as itembarked on its steady progress. Their continuedassistance will be critical to ensuring the sustainabilityand the irreversibility of the political  economic andsocial gains made so far.The HIV/AIDS pandemic in Mozambique is agrowing threat to sustainable development. Togetherwith malaria  tuberculosis and cholera  it isjeopardizing decades of economic and socialdevelopment. Without an aggressive response by theyear 2020  20 per cent of the agricultural labour forcein Mozambique will be lost to HIV/AIDS  and it isestimated that life expectancy will drop to 36 years by2010.Within the framework of the African Union andits programmatic vision  the New Partnership forAfricaís Development (NEPAD)  Africa has beenmaking important strides towards its renaissance andthe ownership of its destiny. In that endeavour  we havewitnessed a further strengthening of democracy on thecontinent. Moreover  Africa has been increasinglydischarging its responsibility with regard to themaintenance of peace and stability on the continent.Today we are building self-confidence aroundAfrica and creating the necessary conditions forsustainable development. Through NEPAD we areraising the ownership spirit surrounding Africanleaders to bring about significant changes in Africaísdevelopment. The recognition that success can only beachieved through partnership among all stakeholders isa step forward in the establishment of public-privatepartnerships  regional integration and cooperationamong different regions in Africa.We would like to commend the decision of theSecretary-General to appoint an advisory panel oninternational support for NEPAD.During the last few years  we have witnessedglobal action towards the materialization of theMillennium Development Goals around the world. Inthat endeavour  we have registered mixed results withencouraging developments on one side and visiblesetbacks on the other.We have seen a strong determination bydeveloping countries to achieve the Goals throughrelevant domestic actions and policies. However despite such a clear commitment to improvement of theliving conditions of our respective peoples  our goalsmay not be realized  due mainly to an unfavourableinternational environment  including insufficient flowsof official development assistance and foreign directinvestment.Consequently  we are failing in the creation of thenecessary conditions for the achievement of theMillennium Development Goals. We will not be able toachieve the 3 per cent economic growth worldwide thatis required for reducing poverty by half by 2015  whilesub-Saharan Africa records a disappointing level ofeconomic growth.The flow of financial resources for the mostneeded regions is decreasing. Market access remains achallenge for both developing and developed countries.Pandemic diseases  in particular HIV/AIDS  areaggressively eroding the productive capacity ofdeveloping countries.We therefore need concerted global action toeffectively address those challenges. The meeting ofworld leaders for action against hunger and povertyheld at the United Nations yesterday was anencouraging renewal of the commitment of theinternational community to make the MillenniumDevelopment Goals a reality. The final declaration thatwas adopted should be the guide to our collectiveaction against hunger and poverty.The success of the ongoing reforms should bemeasured against an effective improvement of globalgovernance and the strengthening of multilateralism with the General Assembly assuming a central role inthe conduct of global issues. The United Nations7should pursue a multilateral approach that truly reflectsthe current realities of the world  rather than entrenchan anachronism inherited from the end of the SecondWorld War.I urge you to continue the process of reform ofour Organization  in order to have a Security Councilthat is democratic  representative  equitable andtransparent. I urge you to continue with the agenda foreconomic and social development.I feel honoured for having shared experienceswith Your Excellencies. I will keep and cherishmemories of the long and difficult  but gratifyingmoments that we have spent together  buildingconsensus around vital issues for our Organization and indeed  for our world. They were precious moments oflearning and of individual and collective enrichment.I express my profound gratitude to the UnitedNations family for all the support they have given tome and to my country. I plead for the continuation ofthat solidarity to Mozambique  with the aim oferadicating poverty  hunger and endemic diseases.I leave you with a sense of having fulfilled myduty and given my humble contribution to the cause ofliberation  peace and development of Mozambique Africa and the world as a whole.The goal of complete decolonization has not yetbeen fulfilled  as the fate of 16 Non-Self-GoverningTerritories has yet to be determined. We continue tolook for the day when the agenda of the GeneralAssembly will contemplate neither colonies nor Non-Self-Governing Territories.I look forward to a successful fifty-ninth session one in which we will focus on the priority actions forthe present year and for the years ahead. Whatever wedo  we must be able to give real hope to our nationsand peoples ó hope not just to live  but also to livewell and safely; hope not only to continue to be free but to be free in decency and dignity."
"120",4866,"MRT",59,2004,"Iam pleased  Sir  to congratulate you and your friendlycountry  Gabon  on your well-deserved election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession. We remain convinced that your great skills andrich experience guarantee the success of our work. Iwould also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. JulianHunte  who so ably guided the work of the previoussession. I should like also to express my sincerecongratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan andto his entire team  on the immense efforts they haveexerted to achieve the noble ideals of our Organization.Allow me to express our deep satisfaction at theactivities undertaken since the last Assembly session notably the high-level segment of the Economic andSocial Council  held in New York in June  on the themeof “Resources mobilization and enabling environmentfor poverty eradication in the context of theimplementation of the Programme of Action for theLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010”.My country had the privilege of hosting thepreparatory meeting for our subregion last April bringing together government sectors and internationalpartners  as well as regional civil society organizations.We hail the efforts to define priorities and themeasures needed to implement the recommendations ofthe Monterrey Conference on Financing forDevelopment  the decisions taken at the JohannesburgSummit on Sustainable Development and theMillennium Development Goals. I should note herethat those Goals will be reached only if the Group ofEight and the other industrialized countries pursuetheir joint efforts to provide greater support andassistance to developing countries. In this regard  Iwould also like to reaffirm my country’s support forthe New York Declaration on the Action AgainstHunger and Poverty.The achievement of the Development Goals andensuring security and stability are closely linked tohow we address the problem of violence and terrorism.Terrorism is a global problem  and its solution mustalso be global. The fight must be based on anintellectual and cultural vision of the complementarityof civilizations and on an absolute rejection ofconfrontation between countries.It is important also to note the unjust disparity inthe level of development between rich and poorcountries  because poverty and social  scientific technological underdevelopment are among the maincauses of tension  violence and extremism. The growthof terrorism  and its resulting fear and destruction obliges the international community to engage in closerdialogue  increased coordination and a concerted effortto face the dangers that threaten all humankind.My country  Mauritania  firmly condemnsterrorism in all its forms and manifestations  includingthe taking and killing of hostages  and we reaffirm ourcommitment to combat that phenomenon  which isalien to our society and to our sacred Islamic values which reject violence and extremism and which call fordialogue  understanding  tolerance and the acceptanceof others.It is clear that the repeated failure of theinternational community to fulfil its commitments withregard to the establishment of a comprehensive  justand lasting peace in the Middle East and theestablishment of an independent Palestinian Stateliving side by side with Israel  remains the main causeof insecurity and instability in the region and of thegrowth of the extremism and violence from which weall are suffering.That is why it is high time that the internationalcommunity — represented by the Security Council  theGeneral Assembly and all relevant regional and9international actors  including the Quartet — worktogether to bring about peace and stability in theMiddle East  which  together with the rest of the world has suffered for so long from the destructive effects ofwar.It is high time that we implement the Arab peaceinitiative  under which the Arab States guaranteecomprehensive peace and the promise of normalrelations to Israel in exchange for a completewithdrawal from all Palestinian  Syrian and Lebaneseterritories up to the borders of 4 June 1967  theestablishment of an independent Palestinian State  withEast Jerusalem as its capital  and a just  consensualresolution of the refugee issue. Clearly  there is no wayto achieve that noble goal except to carry out the peaceprocess and to resume the negotiations on all tracks  inkeeping with the Madrid terms of reference  theprinciple of land for peace  the road map and therelevant provisions of international law.We are following with interest the developmentof the situation in Iraq  and we reaffirm ourcommitment to the unity  territorial integrity sovereignty and independence of Iraq and to non-interference in its internal affairs. My country alsoreaffirms its support for the brotherly Iraqi people  itsInterim National Council and its Interim Governmentin their efforts to overcome the difficulties hamperingtheir aspirations to security  stability and theestablishment of State institutions.We are also following with interest thedevelopment of the situation in Darfur. We welcomethe commendable efforts of the Sudanese Government in cooperation with the African Union  the League ofArab States and the United Nations  with a view toresolving the humanitarian  security and politicalaspects of the crisis. We call upon all regional andinternational actors to support those efforts and toaccord to the Sudanese Government the time it needsto honour its commitments without threats of armedintervention  the imposition of sanctions or anytendentious propaganda aimed at giving the Darfurproblem an ethnic or sectarian dimension. In thatregard  I welcome the positive results achievedfollowing the peace negotiations held at Abuja andN’Djamena  sponsored by the African Union. Iencourage all the parties to continue the dialogue andthe negotiation process  since that is the only way toresolve the crisis.I now turn to Western Sahara. Mauritaniasupports the efforts undertaken by the United Nationsand its Secretary-General to arrive at a definitivesettlement that brings stability to the region and enjoysthe agreement of all the parties.My country is strongly committed to contributingto relations of cooperation and solidarity within theframework of our integrated regional affiliations. Weare deeply convinced of the need for the Arab MaghrebUnion  which remains an indispensable strategic optionand an ambitious project aimed at enabling the peoplesof the region to achieve greater complementarity andsolidarity. My country seeks to deepen dialogue understanding and cultural contacts amongcivilizations through the five-plus-five approach andthe Barcelona approach.At the level of the African continent  wecommend the solidarity and complementarity withinthe framework of the organization on the use of theSenegal River and the brotherly and friendly bilateralrelations with West African countries. My country alsowelcomes the decisions taken recently by theinstitutions and organs of the African Union particularly the formation of an African Parliament anda Peace and Security Council  which will constitute aframework that will enable us to transcend all currentdifficulties.At the international level  Mauritania reaffirms itssupport for the People’s Republic of China as the soleand legal representative of the Chinese people. In thatregard  we appreciate the efforts of the ChineseGovernment aimed at achieving its reunification bypeaceful means.My country has the honour to preside over thecurrent session of the League of Arab States at thelevel of Ministers for Foreign Affairs. I should like tostress that the Arab Summit reaffirmed at Tunis theresolve of all Arab States to pursue the reform processby deepening democracy  expanding politicalparticipation and promoting respect for human rights the advancement of women and the understanding thatsuch reform must be progressive  gradual and adaptedto social and cultural traditions specific to the States ofthe region  not imposed from outside.Mauritania is pursuing its efforts in that directionunder the leadership of the President of the Republic His Excellency Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya and continues to work to establish the rule of law  good10governance and pluralistic democracy that promoteshuman rights  freedom of expression  and personal andgeneral freedoms.At the socio-economic level  we have adoptedsignificant new laws  such as those dealing with labourand trafficking in persons and the introduction of broadreforms that would enable us to make progress inmodernizing public administration to improve itsperformance  liberalizing private enterprise  promotinginvestment and providing basic services for ourcitizens  such as education  health and potable water.The Charter of the United Nations reflects thecommon aspiration of the world’s peoples to attaintheir fundamental development objectives and toensure international peace and security. Clearly  thesweeping changes now taking place in the internationalarena call for the reform of United Nations structureswith a view to expanding representation on theSecurity Council  thereby opening it up to key regions such as Africa and Latin America  as well assignificant groups  such as the Group of Arab States and important industrialized countries that providesubstantial contributions to the Organization  such asGermany and Japan  in order to respond to the newchanges taking place and to enable the Council  thusrestructured  to better reflect the realities and diversityof today’s world.We sincerely hope to see the internationalcommunity work together to consolidate internationalsolidarity in order to establish a new  just and moreequitable world order that safeguards peace andsecurity and provides a life of freedom and dignity foreveryone."
"121",4912,"MUS",59,2004,"Mr. President  I bringyou the greetings and the best wishes of theGovernment and people of Mauritius. It is also a matterof pride and honour to see you preside over thispremier world institution. That honour is not onlyrecognition of the contribution of your country  Gabon in world affairs but also a great moment for ourcontinent  Africa. We are confident that  with yourwide experience and vast diplomatic skills  you willsuccessfully steer the work of the Assembly. Mydelegation pledges its full support to you during yourtenure.My delegation would also like to place on recordour gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  forhis able and excellent leadership of the General18Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. As fellowislanders  we derived great satisfaction and pride fromhis unequalled stewardship. He assumed anddischarged the high responsibilities of President of theAssembly with commitment  dedication and greatdiplomacy. We thank him for his service to the worldcommunity.Allow me also to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his relentless efforts anddetermination to ensure that our Organizationcontinues to play its role effectively in the internationalarena.This session of the General Assembly is takingplace as we prepare ourselves to tackle and face majorchallenges and developments over the next 12 months.Of particular importance to small island developingStates such as my own  2005 will begin with two majorevents: the International Meeting for the full andcomprehensive review of the implementation of theBarbados Programme of Action  which will be hostedby Mauritius; and the World Conference on DisasterReduction  to be held in Japan.Ten years after Barbados  small island developingStates continue to face practically the same challengesin their drive to achieve sustainable development.Their small size  fragile ecosystems  geographicisolation and limited resources  compounded by thethreats of climate change  rising sea levels and naturaldisasters  make them particularly vulnerable. While itis a fact that many developing countries face theincreasing pressures posed by the combined forces ofglobalization and trade liberalization  such pressuresare even more exacerbating for small island developingStates. Their small markets and the limited marketaccess for their products constrain them greatly in theirefforts to integrate smoothly into the global economy.They also suffer from natural vulnerabilities tophenomena such as hurricanes  earthquakes andtsunamis. The devastation caused by the recent seriesof hurricanes in the Caribbean islands demonstrates theextent of our vulnerability. It is true that thosevulnerabilities have been recognized in a variety ofinternational forums  but such recognition has yet tocrystallize in concrete actions in favour of small islanddeveloping States. The precarious situation of ourStates is of direct concern to the internationalcommunity as a whole.May we then resolve to take bold initiatives toimplement meaningfully the Barbados Programme andto respond to related emerging issues so that smallisland developing States can build resilience andcapacity and be integrated fully into the globaleconomy? Similarly  in the multilateral trading system we expect the emergence of an environment conduciveto enabling our States to improve theircompetitiveness  their market access and thediversification of their economies. We therefore expectthe World Trade Organization to soon establish a workprogramme for small economies.As a small island developing State  Mauritius isindeed honoured to host the International Meeting. TheInternational Meeting should be not only a collectivegathering to reflect on the specificities of our concerns.It should also be a landmark in the history of the majorUnited Nations conferences  with deliverable outcomesand the means necessary for their implementation.We in Mauritius are leaving no stone unturned tomake that event truly historic and memorable. It isimportant that the entire international communityparticipate in that meeting  which  allow me to pointout  is a United Nations meeting on small islanddevelopment States and not a meeting for those Statesalone.(spoke in French)The work to be undertaken by the small islanddeveloping States is based upon sustainabledevelopment and the restricted resources available tothose countries. How can one not welcome  therefore the decision taken by the Government of Burkina Faso host of the next summit of la Francophonie  which haschosen solidarity and sustainable development as thetheme of the summit.Our preoccupation with sustainabledevelopment — the basis of the JohannesburgSummit — is even stronger in the context ofglobalization today. Although only a handful ofdeveloping island States are French-speaking  we trustthat the Summit will highlight the need for us to find within the international community  ways and means tohelp small island developing States  which may thenbecome models for sustainable development.(spoke in English)Global warming  and its related effects on climatechange  is now an undisputed reality  and islands sufferthe brunt of it  even though — let me emphasize this —we are the least responsible for the cause. We believethat the Kyoto Protocol is the most appropriatemechanism for global action now and in the future  toaddress the issue of global warming. We call  therefore 19for its ratification and entry into force  as soon aspossible.Africa  home to 34 of the world’s 48 poorestcountries  remains an enormous challenge for theUnited Nations. The deadly spread of HIV and AIDScontinues to claim a devastating toll on the continent particularly in southern Africa. We in Africa arecommitted to further democratize our societies andgive our people a rightful voice in the decision-makingprocess. That is why at the continental level  we aredoing all we can  despite our scarce resources  toconsolidate the African Union and make it central inour collective bid to grapple with the developmentconcerns of our region. Using that perspective  we havecome up with our own home-grown programme  theNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)in order to attain the ultimate goal that we have fixedfor ourselves — the total integration of Africa.Since we launched the African Union Peace andSecurity Council last May  we have receivedencouraging support from some of our developmentpartners. I should like to use this platform to urge theinternational community to support the African Unionin that field to enable it to come to grips with theconflicts that continue to divert our attention andmeagre resources from our development efforts.In addressing the issue of conflicts on thecontinent  the African Union has amply demonstratedthat it means business  and any assistance it gets fromthe international community can only help it to achieveits goals. But let me hasten to say that the AfricanUnion’s involvement in peace processes should notdistract the United Nations Security Council from itsprimary responsibility to maintain peace and securityin Africa. Indeed  the Security Council should notallow itself to be perceived as being selective in itsapproach with regard to conflicts in various parts of theworld. Experiences in the Great Lakes region and inWest Africa have shown that the combined efforts ofthe Security Council and the African Union can bringtangible results.Before I leave this part of my statement  let merefer to the unjust treatment that continues to be metedout to the Saharawi people who are still struggling fortheir right to self-determination. It is the duty of thisworld body to ensure a speedy conclusion of thatmatter. In this regard  my delegation reiterates itssupport for the Settlement Plan and any other politicalinitiative acceptable to the parties concerned that willhelp to take the process forward for a durable andsustainable solution. The Saharawi people deserve thatcommitment from us.As this Assembly is aware  Mauritius has alwaysfavoured a bilateral approach in our resolve to restoreour exercise of sovereignty over the ChagosArchipelago which  prior to independence from theUnited Kingdom  was unlawfully detached from ourterritory  in violation of the Declaration on theGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries andPeoples contained in General Assembly resolution1514 (XV)  and Assembly resolutions 2066 (XX)  2232(XXI) and 2357 (XXII). Such bilateral approacheshave unfortunately not yielded any result so far andcertain recent regrettable unilateral actions by theUnited Kingdom have not been helpful.While we shall continue to favour a settlement ofthe matter through dialogue  we shall use all avenuesopen to us in order to exercise our full sovereign rightsover the Chagos Archipelago. The Assembly shouldalso note that this issue has a tragic human dimension.Before Mauritius acceded to its independence  all theinhabitants of the Chagos were forced to leave the landof their birth  where they had lived for severalgenerations. The plight of those inhabitants must nowbe comprehensively addressed.In the same context  my delegation looks forwardto the resumption of dialogue with the FrenchGovernment over Tromelin island.Mauritius is a firm believer and  indeed  a keenplayer in regional cooperation and integration  not asan end in itself but as a sure means to enable us tointegrate the global economy. We consider regionalcooperation as a necessary step to enable Africa tobenefit from globalization. We have therefore sparedno effort to promote regional cooperation. Since theearly 1980s we in Mauritius  have been playing a pro-active role in advancing the objectives of the AbujaTreaty. Mauritius is a very active member of theCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa(COMESA) and of the South African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC).As the new Chair of SADC  we look forward toworking very closely with all our fellow member Statesin advancing the objectives of the organization promoting community building through regionalintegration and aligning national policies for regionalcooperation so that they stay on course in theglobalization process. We will also endeavour to forgea strong relationship between SADC and its20development partners as well as with othersubregional  continental and multilateral organizations.After the failure of the WTO MinisterialConference at Cancún  the successful outcome of theJuly 2004 General Council meeting has come as a rayof hope to put the trade talks back on track. The Julypackage of frameworks and other agreements that theWTO members approved will greatly enhance thechances for a successful completion of the DohaDevelopment Agenda negotiations.We therefore welcome the decision adopted bythe WTO General Council to fulfil the developmentdimensions of the Doha Development Agenda  whichplaces the needs and interests of developing and leastdeveloped countries at the heart of the Doha Agendawork programme.In that context  let me make an appeal for ameaningful synergy to be established among thedevelopment agencies and other United Nationsinstitutions  including the Bretton Woods institutions in order to ensure that developing countries developtheir capacity to increase their share of world trade as anecessary pathway to prosperity.The situation in the Middle East remainsextremely preoccupying for all freedom-loving nationsand peoples. We go on speaking of the need for acomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East without realizing that each year the peace and securitysituation in the region is growing worse.Over the past year  we witnessed more targetedassassinations  increased terrorist acts  dailyrecriminations from both sides and an expansion ofsettlement activities. The illegal construction of a wallby Israel in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of theoccupied Palestinian territories has worsened analready complex situation.Almost two years ago the road map called for afinal and comprehensive settlement of the Israel-Palestinian conflict by 2005. The year 2005 is at ourdoorstep and we are still grappling with how to put thederailed peace process back on track. We believe thatthe road map remains the only viable option for peacein the region. We call on both Israel and Palestine toexercise maximum restraint  undertake confidence-building measures and create the appropriateenvironment  with the help of the Quartet  toimplement the road map.My delegation believes that what is needed todayis not a wall  but a political solution and a renewedcommitment from the international community thatwould resolve the conflict altogether. Only the creationof the much-awaited Palestinian State  existing side byside with Israel with secured and recognized borders can bring peace and stability to the Middle East.The political process in Iraq reached an importantmilestone last June with the handing over of authorityto the Iraqi Interim Government. My delegationbelieves that the holding of national elections earlynext year  as required by Security Council resolution1546 (2004)  will give the people of Iraq a uniqueopportunity to take the destiny of their country intotheir own hands. However  the current securitysituation in Iraq is very disturbing. My delegationcondemns all acts of violence that can disrupt Iraq’spolitical and economic transition. The internationalcommunity must be fully engaged in its efforts torebuild a safe  democratic and peaceful Iraq.Given the potential threat posed by nuclearweapons and weapons of mass destruction  it is amatter of serious concern that we still have not beenable to find common ground to initiate a processleading to complete disarmament. Significantdifferences still persist among parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We onceagain appeal to all Member States to translate theirstated commitments to the cause of disarmament intoaction.Mauritius supports and implements fully theinternational disarmament treaties such as theChemical Weapons Convention and the Biological andToxin Weapons Convention and has always supportedthe various United Nations resolutions related to theconsolidation of those regimes  including resolution1540 (2004)  which focuses on non-proliferationissues.Along with our fight against weapons of massdestruction  we should also stay the course against theillicit trade in small arms and light weapons  whichhave been the weapons of choice in recent conflicts particularly in Africa.Terrorist acts continue to create fear and havocamong peaceful nations and lead to the loss of lives particularly among innocent civilians  includingwomen and children. We should therefore reflect on theeffectiveness of the international response to terrorism.It is becoming increasingly evident that the war againstinternational terrorism cannot be won by militarymight alone. Several reports submitted to thisAssembly have already amply demonstrated that21problems such as poverty  social inequality unemployment and illiteracy constitute breedinggrounds for terrorism. Genuine internationalcooperation is therefore needed to comprehensivelyaddress the root causes of terrorism.Allow me to share some thoughts with respect tothe future of our Organization. The world emergedfrom the Second World War resolved to ensure peaceamong nations  and the United Nations was born withthat vision firmly in mind. Now  more than half acentury later  in full recognition of the drastic and far-reaching changes that have transformed our world there is full consensus for a reform of ourOrganization.There is indeed general agreement that thecurrent structure of the Security Council needs to bereviewed to reflect the new realities of the world. Wefirmly believe that a greater commitment has to bedemonstrated by every member of the Organization inorder to reach an agreement on a reformed SecurityCouncil based on wider representation  transparencyand equitable geographical distribution with theinclusion of developing countries from Africa  Asiaand Latin America as permanent members. Here  letme reiterate our conviction that India fully deserves tohave that status. In that respect  I need to underscorethe need for small island States  which are scatteredover all the oceans of the world  to have an adequatevoice in the Council.It is therefore our sincere hope that the High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change appointed bythe Secretary-General will make concrete and practicalrecommendations to make the United Nations morecredible and responsive to the expectations of people inevery corner of the globe. The high-level plenarymeeting  which is to be held next year  would also bean opportunity for us to take stock of progress made inrespect to the goals set in the major United Nationsconferences and summits.Mauritius continues to be an active supporter ofthe United Nations in its efforts to save succeedinggenerations from war and suffering and to promotesocial progress and better standards of life. Mauritiusbelieves that a strengthened United Nations  evolvingwithin the framework of a credible multilateral system is the only effective instrument at the disposal of theinternational community to bring order and ensure thecoherence of international economic  social andenvironmental policies."
"122",4949,"MWI",59,2004,"I am delighted to beparticipating  for the first time  in the deliberations ofthe General Assembly as head of State andGovernment of the Republic of Malawi.I should like to begin by joining others who havespoken before me in congratulating Mr. Jean Ping onhis assumption of the high office of President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I have nodoubt that his election will provide an opportunity toincrease global awareness of the enormous challengesthat Africa and other less developed regions of theworld are facing. I hope that  through him  theopportunity for the poor countries to fully participatein world economic prosperity will be enhanced.I also wish to avail myself of this opportunity topay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Julian Robert Hunte for guiding the work of the fifty-eighth session withadmirable skill and pragmatism.We also salute Mr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for the dynamicleadership skills that he continues to display in steeringthe affairs of the Organization.I have entitled my statement 'Sharing globalprosperity'. I have done so in order to underscore thefact that one of the most daunting challenges facing theinternational community today is to achieve a balancein economic transformation and growth between therich and the poor countries so as to eradicate povertyamong the latter.In looking at the future of the United Nations  weneed to take stock of the response to world poverty. Iam aware that several attempts have been made by theinternational community to alleviate poverty - and thegoal is still being pursued - but the results so far havebeen dismal. During the past 30 years  for example  thenumber of least developed countries has risen from 25to 49. This means that globally  economic growth is inreverse gear. Among the questions we are asking withregard to the sharing of global prosperity is this: why28are the industrialized countries more prosperous  whilein Africa and the rest of the developing countriespoverty is increasing? In other words  why hasglobalization failed to achieve a more equitabledistribution of global prosperity?In Malawi we have discovered that we need toseriously transform our economic structures in order tobegin to provide and produce new wealth. This can beachieved by transforming the abundant agriculturalcommodities  raw materials and minerals into goodsthat can be traded globally. It is only by creating newwealth in rural areas that we can effectively eradicatepoverty.Our major strategy is to gain a share in globalprosperity by transforming Malawi from being animporting and consuming country to being apredominantly producing and exporting country. Inother words  we must begin to position our economy totake full advantage of global trade. This will beachieved through intensive industrial research and theapplication of science and technology to the specificconditions in my country.Malawi - as in the case of most Africancountries - is richly endowed with a wide range ofagricultural primary commodities  good soil and waterresources that can enable us to develop viable agro-processing and manufacturing industries. The criticalissue for us in Malawi  therefore  is the creation of newwealth as the basis for poverty reduction. In order to dothat  we must encourage significant domestic savings as well as inflows of resources  especially foreigndirect investment.We in Malawi estimate that in order to alleviatepoverty  we need to achieve an annual growth rate of atleast 6 per cent over the next decade. In order toachieve that  we are determined to create conditions forsustainable macroeconomic growth throughfundamental policy reforms to improve economic andpolitical governance. We have put in place measuresfor the reform of the public sector  the agriculturalsector and the private sector.We are also determined to improve goodgovernance by stamping out corruption. To that end we have adopted a zero-tolerance stance with regard tocorruption. I am therefore happy to have signed yesterday  the United Nations Convention againstCorruption.Malawi is cognizant of the fact that our nationalvision must be fully supported by the internationalcommunity. That is why Malawi joins the call forbetter market access and lower tariff and non-tariffbarriers to trade in industrialized countries.Malawi would therefore like to stress the need toadvance the dialogue in the Doha development agenda.For their part  the industrialized nations need toseriously address the major concerns of the pooreconomies. The challenge for industrialized countriesis therefore to share with the poor countries theprosperity that comes about through globalization  byassisting us to stand on our own and to developappropriate technologies for transforming ouragricultural raw materials  minerals and other naturalresources into wealth. In Malawi  we believe that apartner who walks with you side-by-side down the roadis better than one whom you have to carry on yourshoulders. We want to walk with the industrializednations; we do not want to be carried on theirshoulders.Some positive efforts that Malawi welcomestowards global equity include the various initiativestaken by the Group of Eight countries aimed ataddressing some of the concerns to which I have justreferred. Among those are the United Kingdomísdecision to significantly increase its aid and technicalassistance to Africa; the reaffirmation of strong supportfor the New Partnership for Africa's Development; thedecision by the United States Government to extendthe African Growth and Opportunity Act from 2008 to2015; and the European Union's 'Everything ButArms' initiative  which seeks to enhance opportunitiesfor increased access for African exports into theEuropean market.Those initiatives are  indeed  encouraging  andmy Government fully appreciates them. I wish however  to appeal for those noble promises andcommitments to be matched by action. We need proofthat actions speak louder than words.The management of foreign debt is anotherpositive way in which global prosperity can be shared.Our concern is that  in spite of numerous initiativesaimed at finding a durable solution to the debtproblem  the world is nowhere near that solution. MyGovernment is still allocating a significant amount ofour resources to debt-servicing at the expense ofinvestment in infrastructure  production and income29generation. Such diversion of resources has led  amongother things  to the deepening of poverty and a lack ofsignificant macroeconomic growth.However  Malawi  like other eligible Africancountries  had welcomed arrangements for debt reliefunder the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)Debt Initiative. But the conditions for reaching thedecision and completion points are so arduous thatonly a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa havemanaged to reach the completion stage. We believe thatthe preconditions for the HIPC Initiative areunrealistic. Surely  less stringent conditionalities wouldhave enabled more countries to succeed.That notwithstanding  Malawi welcomes themeasures by some bilateral donors to respond to theexternal debt crisis. In particular  I must mention theGovernment of Japan  which  a few weeks ago cancelled a debt Malawi owed it  amounting to $256million. I take this opportunity to thank Japan mostsincerely for that gesture. We hope that otherindustrialized countries will follow this example.I referred earlier to the need for adequate donorsupport to sustain national initiatives. In that regard  Ibelieve that the New Partnership for AfricaísDevelopment (NEPAD) provides a framework forsharing the responsibility for economic developmentbetween Africa and the rich countries. It is for thatreason that Malawi has acceded to NEPADís AfricanPeer Review Mechanism in a bid to put in placeinternationally accepted political and economic goodgovernance. Our accession to the African Peer ReviewMechanism is also a demonstration of our confidencein the NEPAD programme as a tool to enhance Africaíseffective participation in global prosperity.Let me now turn to a global challenge thatthreatens all development efforts. This is theHIV/AIDS pandemic. The HIV/AIDS pandemiccontinues to pound incessantly upon the Africaneconomies  destroying the capacity of many countriesto achieve sustainable economic development. Becauseit affects the most productive segment of our labourforce  we are losing more qualified and experiencedpersonnel much faster than we can train new ones.The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a human tragedy ofunimaginable proportions. Experience in dealing withthis disaster in my country has taught us thatHIV/AIDS is a medical crisis  an economic crisis  asocial crisis and a political crisis. It is a medical crisisbecause no cure has yet been found for HIV/AIDS. It isan economic crisis because it is depleting financial andhuman resources for development while alsodevastating our national capacities for goodgovernance. HIV/AIDS is a social crisis because of thestigma that makes the affected unable to be integratedinto normal day-to-day relations as well as in the workplaces. HIV/AIDS has also created a large number oforphans that need to be cared for. HIV/AIDS is apolitical crisis because it threatens democraticinstitutions by killing politicians and others who arethe voice of the people.Therefore  in order to deal with this pandemic we have learned the imperative of adopting a holisticapproach. It is for that reason that we appeal to theUnited Nations to collectively raise new awareness new assumptions and new solutions. To that end  theUnited Nations ought to redesign its policy inproviding support  care  treatment and prevention ofHIV/AIDS  alongside the provision of adequate nutritious food and a proper diet.Before concluding my statement  I wish to raiseanother concern I have concerning the efforts towardssustainable growth and the development of the world.This relates to the need for world peace. One canhardly emphasize enough that  without global peace there cannot be global prosperity. In that regard  Iwould like to welcome the efforts made by theSecretary-General  jointly with the Security Council  intaking a number of decisive steps towards conflictprevention  resolution and management around theglobe.Turning to the specific issues of peace in Africa  Iam concerned that sub-Saharan Africa has been andcontinues to be one of the most unstable and conflict-prone regions of the globe. The region also happens tobe home to most of the worldís poorest people  who areliving below the international poverty line.The conflict in Sudan's Darfur region  inparticular  is yet another sad chapter in the history ofsub-Saharan Africa and one that the African people canill afford. Africa and the international community mustfind quick and lasting solutions to the crisis in theDarfur region.I would like to conclude my statement byassuring the General Assembly that my Governmentfully endorses the proposals to reform the UnitedNations. We share the belief that a more representative30and democratic United Nations will enhance theefficiency and credibility of this global Organization. Itwill also enhance the efforts towards a just and moreequitable sharing of global prosperity.May God bless the United Nations."
"123",4995,"MYS",59,2004,"May I  as PrimeMinister of Malaysia and in my capacity as Chairmanof the Non-Aligned Movement and Chairman of thetenth Islamic Summit Conference  offer my sincerecongratulations to you  Mr. President  on your electionas the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I am confident that with your wisdom experience and diplomatic skill  you will steer theproceedings of the Assembly to a successfulconclusion. I assure you of Malaysia’s fullestcooperation. I strongly believe that the membercountries of the Non-Aligned Movement and theOrganization of the Islamic Conference wouldsimilarly render all their support and cooperation toyou.Allow me also to pay tribute to yourdistinguished predecessor  the Honourable JulianRobert Hunte of Saint Lucia. He discharged hisresponsibility with dedication and full commitment  inan efficient and effective manner. I commendespecially his leadership in moving forward the processof revitalization of the General Assembly.I wish to commend as well the Secretary-Generaland the Secretariat for their perseverance and relentlessefforts in pursuit of the goals of the United Nations. Inparticular  I congratulate the Secretary-General for hisinitiatives to claim for the United Nations a morecentral role in the management of world affairs. Isalute also the dedicated men and women of the UnitedNations who have sacrificed their lives in the serviceof humanity.When we met last year at the Assembly’s fifty-eighth session  we were deeply distressed that therewas so much gloom in the international situation as aresult of a breakdown in the multilateral negotiatingprocesses. We were bitterly divided over the invasionof Iraq; there was great disappointment about thedeadlock in the World Trade Organization ministerialmeeting in Cancún  and we had to mourn the death ofinternational civil servants who were killed during anact of terrorism against the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad.2Therefore  I consider it our solemn obligation atthis fifty-ninth session to reaffirm the rightful role ofthe United Nations in the management of critical issuesaffecting international peace and security  and commitourselves to abide by multilateralism in the quest for amore just and equitable international order. We mustalso take the necessary steps to ensure that never againshould the United Nations be sidelined.As the General Assembly is the mostrepresentative organ of the United Nations  we mustdedicate ourselves to finding consensus on measures torevitalize the Assembly to fulfil its mandate inaccordance with the Charter. We must build upon thework done in the fifty-eighth session. Again  we looktowards the leadership of the Assembly President inthat regard.In that connection  the Malaysian delegationwishes to advocate that this fifty-ninth session of theAssembly accord high priority to ensuring that theUnited Nations regains its central role in social economic and development issues. The UnitedNations — through an enhanced Economic and SocialCouncil — should provide the impetus for the creationof an international economic system which betterpromotes the interests of developing countries. TheUnited Nations must do more to realize allinternationally agreed targets  particularly theMillennium Development Goals. As the eradication ofpoverty and hunger is fundamental to the achievementof those Goals  Malaysia fully appreciates the Brazilianinitiative to create new and innovative forms offunding to meet those challenges.We look forward to receiving the report of theHigh-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change appointed by the Secretary-General last year. Webelieve the Secretary-General will make his ownrecommendations based on that report  and they shouldprovide the basis for in-depth discussion amongMember States in the months leading up to the sixtiethanniversary of the United Nations.This world body  the processes of multilateralismand  indeed  the entire international system mustnecessarily change. However  those changes must beeffected without sacrificing certain immutableprinciples  such as sovereign equality  non-interferencein the domestic affairs of States  peaceful settlement ofdisputes and respect for international law. What we doin that respect during the fifty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly will therefore be crucial.Reform of the United Nations is a causeparticularly dear to both the Non-Aligned Movementand the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Theylook forward to working closely with you Mr. President  as well as with other Members of theUnited Nations and the Secretary-General on thismatter.Most immediately  we must find ways and meansto let the United Nations assume its proper role incombating international terrorism. Malaysia isconvinced that the fight against terrorism cannotsucceed through the force of arms alone. To win it  weneed to exert genuine efforts and demonstrate goodfaith to address the root causes of terrorism  one of themost obvious of which is the unfulfilled dreams ofpeoples struggling for independence and aspiring tosovereign States of their own. To find the answers  wemust promote genuine dialogue and rid ourselves of theprejudices and bigotry triggered by the events of11 September and further aggravated by subsequentevents. The United Nations is clearly the best forumfor such a dialogue to take place without malice  in ashared environment that is devoted to finding peaceamong nations and building friendship betweenpeoples. The United Nations can facilitate theconvening of a special international conference toconsider the question in all its aspects  including theroot causes of terrorism and the issue of State-sponsored terrorism.One of the most important aspects to beaddressed by such a dialogue is the necessity toinculcate a frank appreciation  understanding andacceptance of different civilizations and cultures including religions. There is an urgent need to stoptarnishing the Muslim world with unfair stereotypes.We must cease associating Islam with violence poverty and indignity. In reality  the troubles havenothing to do with Islam; nor are the problemsexclusively associated with Muslims. We need to clearthe confusion that links the problems faced by someMuslim countries with the religion of Islam.We also note with great concern the increasingtendency to link the fight against terrorism with thecampaign against the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. Developing countries suffer as a result ofrestrictions imposed on their access for peaceful uses3to the technology  equipment and material necessaryfor their economic development. Malaysia is fully andfirmly committed to the cause of non-proliferation  butthere must be multilateral negotiations for universal comprehensive and non-discriminatory agreements andarrangements. Above all  nothing should be done at theexpense of the resources needed for the internationaldevelopment agenda.Most damaging of all is the increasing tendencyto attribute linkages between international terrorismand Islam. The time has indeed arrived for us todebunk  once and for all  the theory that there is a clashof civilizations. I speak from the experience of my owncountry  Malaysia  where we have shown that Islam isnot an impediment to modernity and to democracy. It isnot an impediment to rapid economic growth  to self-respect and confidence  to tolerance and mutual respectacross religions  cultures and ethnic groups. InMalaysia  we celebrate the multi-ethnicity of ourpeople  of Malaysians. For us  our multi-ethnic andcultural diversity is a national asset. It has taught us tobe tolerant  value mutual respect and cooperate for thecommon good. We sincerely believe that this messagedeserves a wider audience.I am certain that the Organization of the IslamicConference would be supportive of a dialogue designedto create greater understanding between peoples andcivilizations and that would lead to real action andeffect changes at the societal level. The Non-AlignedMovement  too  would be equally keen to supportinitiatives that would have the effect of establishingharmony and restoring stability in the world.Since the stability of many nation-Statescontinues to be threatened  especially by armedconflicts  there is a critical need  more than ever  forMembers of the United Nations to unite and closeranks to put a stop to such conflicts  be they inter-Stateor intra-State.Iraq is still in turmoil. Although Security Councilresolution 1546 (2004) of 8 June 2004 enabled thereturn of sovereignty to the people of Iraq  theunrelenting conflict continues in that country. Thesame resolution also renewed the mandate of themultinational force  but the reality on the groundsuggests that the existing arrangements cannot stabilizethe situation there.The situation in Iraq clearly calls for the UnitedNations to be given the lead role  particularly inestablishing stability in preparation for the electionsscheduled for January 2005. Orderly elections arecritical to the process of re-establishing a trulyindependent and sovereign Government in Iraq.The United Nations also has the best credentialsto enable Member States to take part in peace-buildingand in the reconstruction of Iraq. The internationalcommunity owes it to the people of Iraq to summon itscollective resolve and political will to allow all of thatto happen. If we collectively succeed in assisting Iraqto seize the moment  we would also succeed at thesame time in bringing a closure to the bitterdivisiveness which was brought about  in thebeginning  by unilateralism over that same issue.While the precarious situation in Iraq cries out forUnited Nations action  the plight and suffering of thepeople of Palestine remains a tragic embodiment of theconsequences of non-implementation of UnitedNations resolutions and the non-enforcement of UnitedNations decisions. We must actively revive the roadmap for peace in the Middle East  which remainsunimplemented. The Quartet needs to play a morevigorous role. The international community must lendits full weight to push for an independent andsovereign State of Palestine  with East Jerusalem as itscapital  and with Israel and Palestine living peacefully side by side within secure and recognized borders.To create an environment of confidence for thespeedy resuscitation of the road map  we mustseriously consider approving the deployment of aUnited Nations peacekeeping force or the deploymentof an international monitoring mechanism to overseethe implementation of the road map for peace in theMiddle East.We must also find ways to give effect to thehistoric advisory opinion of the International Court ofJustice on the legal consequences of the construction ofa wall in the occupied Palestinian territory. In Octoberlast year  the General Assembly overwhelminglyadopted a resolution demanding that Israel stop andreverse construction of the wall built in the West Bank.It is unacceptable that a multilateral resolution givingeffect to the International Court of Justice’s advisoryopinion cannot be effectively implemented. Clearly  thesearch for peace and security also depends on ourwillingness and determination to ensure itsenforceability.4I strongly believe that multilateralism is the onlyapproach for implementing resolutions and decisionsconcerning global peace and security. Adherence to theCharter of the United Nations should be a solemnobligation  not a matter of choice. For Malaysia  theUnited Nations is crucial as the guarantor of thesanctity of our existence as a sovereign nation and asthe institution where the principles of international laware protected and safeguarded. Small nations such asMalaysia do not have the military and other means toinsulate themselves from invasion or occupation by bigPowers. But no sovereign nation should ever besubjected to the threat of military action by another. Nointernational intervention should ever be undertakenunless consistent with the United Nations Charter. Ifthe law of the jungle were to prevail  the small and theweak would certainly perish.In this matter  no one should ever lose sight of thefact that when the defence of the nation-State is calledfor  it is actually the well-being of the State’s peoplethat is at stake. The world must take special note ofthis and give due recognition to the voices and thecontributions of global civil society in mattersaffecting international peace and security.To foster genuine peace and security  the worldnaturally looks to the big Powers for leadership. Asincere commitment to multilateralism on the part ofthe big Powers will send a strong signal to all nations large and small  that the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations shall form the basis of the conduct ofrelations between nations. Such a commitment willalso provide the foundation for a true internationalpartnership  not only for establishing global peace andsecurity but also for achieving international economicand social development. Of course  multilateralism canbe sustained only if it embraces all nations asimportant stakeholders and excludes none.Therefore  urgent steps must be taken to makemultilateral processes relevant and effective. To begin the principal organs of the United Nations  in particularthe Security Council  should be rendered moredemocratic and more representative of the number andgeographical distribution of its internationalmembership. The exercise of the veto by the permanentmembers of the Security Council should be regulatedin order to prohibit that power from being used at thesole discretion of its holder. It is unjust that any singlecountry should be allowed the impunity of overrulingat will the wish of the majority. That injustice can berectified  for example  by enabling certain types ofGeneral Assembly resolutions to overrule a SecurityCouncil veto.We must find a comprehensive and just solutionto the problem of Palestine. We must allow the UnitedNations to take the lead role in stabilizing the situationin Iraq. We need to address seriously and resolutely thescourge of international terrorism  the elimination ofglobal poverty  the proliferation of transnationalcrimes  the destruction of the environment and thespread of the AIDS epidemic  as well as the economicand social advancement of all humankind. The globaleconomic order  especially in the sphere ofinternational finance  must be made more fair andequitable. The way forward and our best hope lie inuniversal commitment now to multilateralism."
"124",5022,"NAM",59,2004,"It is a source of pride forAfricans and our friends alike to see you  Sir  presidingover the demanding business of the fifty-ninth sessionof the General Assembly. You bring to your high officethe immense wisdom and experience you have gainedover the years as a dedicated public servant andCabinet minister of the Gabonese Republic. You holdin your capable hands the mandate given to you by theCharter of the United Nations to give new impetus tothe promotion of peace  human security and sustainabledevelopment throughout the world. I congratulate youwarmly and pledge Namibiaís full support to youpersonally and to your Bureau.You will recall  Mr. President  the renewed spiritand firm resolve for change demonstrated by Africanleaders in July 2002 in Durban  South Africa. There we stressed a new beginning for Africa in transformingthe Organization of African Unity (OAU) andlaunching the African Union and its development arm the New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD). We also reiterated our commitment toembrace the African diaspora in consolidating andtransforming our continent.I am  therefore  delighted to note that theoutgoing President of the General Assembly  HisExcellency Mr. Julian Hunte  hails from the sistercountry of Saint Lucia in the Caribbean. I pay tributeto him for his excellent and successful service to theUnited Nations. During his tenure of office  he showedleadership and dedication to world peace  security andsustainable development.We are gathered once again at United NationsHeadquarters to reaffirm the precious ideals  principlesand purposes of the Organization  and to transformthem into action towards ending armed conflict  savingour children and investing resources to eradicatehunger  disease and poverty in the world.Our illustrious and hardworking Secretary-General  my dear brother Kofi Annan  has left no stoneunturned in his tireless efforts to exert his authority inconflict situations. His insistence on the centrality andlegitimate responsibility of the Organization to be onthe side of the poor  the weak and the needy in theworld should be commended. In his annual report onthe work of the Organization (A/59/1)  the Secretary-General once again reminds Member States of theterrible state of the world  and offers real alternativesfor world peace and security  social developmentfinancing and the mitigation of the effects of theHIV/AIDS pandemic and other infectious diseases. Icommend the Secretary-General for his worthyinterventions and effective leadership.During the 1999-2000 period  Namibia had therare honour and privilege of serving the Organizationin two capacities. My country served both as a non-permanent member of the Security Council and simultaneously  as President of the fifty-fourth sessionof the General Assembly  whose task  among others was to prepare for the Millennium Summit and theadoption of the historic Millennium Declaration. I wasthus called upon to co-chair that Summit together withmy Finnish counterpart  Her Excellency Ms. TarjaHalonen.At that memorable Summit  the largest evergathering of world leaders unanimously endorsed thefar-reaching Millennium Development Goals andtargets. Today we all remain bound by that historic andunique undertaking. Member States collectivelypledged  among other things  to eradicate extremepoverty and hunger; achieve universal primaryeducation; promote gender equality and empowerwomen; reduce child mortality and improve maternalhealth; combat HIV/AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis andother diseases; ensure environmental sustainability;and develop a global partnership for sustainabledevelopment.By endorsing those Development Goals andtargets  our Governments have made a serious andirrevocable commitment  through reliable public policyinterventions  to care for the millions of our childrenall over the world who are asking for nothing morethan love  protection and a peaceful childhood.In this undertaking  we cannot ignore the ever-widening income gap between the rich and the poor between the industrialized North and the developingSouth. This situation represents a dangerous timebomb  which the world can ill afford to let take its owncourse. Our planet Earth is too small to perpetuate theunacceptable juxtaposition of abject poverty andabundant prosperity. We will deal with this situationeffectively only when we promote mutually beneficialcommercial trade between the North and the Southwithin the framework of North-South and South-Southcooperation.I would like to emphasize that the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and targets by themselves are only7declarations of intent. Our Governments must translatethem into sustainable policies  buttressed by adequatefinancial and technological resources  to make a realdifference in the lives of our peoples.For its part  Namibia  in cooperation with therelevant United Nations agencies  has adopted acountrywide programme to implement the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and targets. In addition todeploying our own resolve and capabilities  we callupon other development partners to assist us in ournational efforts towards nation-building  reconciliationand transformation.At the initiative of President Luiz Inacio Lula daSilva of the Federative Republic of Brazil  worldleaders converged at United Nations Headquarters on20 September 2004 to exchange views and findworkable solutions aimed at bringing an end to hungerand poverty in the world. We commend him for thatimportant initiative  in which we participated. At theend of the meeting  a declaration was adopted  whichNamibia fully supports. We call upon Member Statesand other stakeholders to implement it with dueurgency.The world has enormous resources with which tofight and defeat poverty  hunger andunderdevelopment. In this process of dialogue  wemust insist on a realistic balance between the totalworld spending on war and weapons technology on theone hand and the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and targets on the other. What isrequired is political will and compassion on the part ofworld leaders. The debate on weapons of massdestruction must not divide United Nations MemberStates  but should lead nations to find and enhancepeaceful coexistence and cooperation. Developedcountries should consider their support to the countriesof the South as an act of enlightened contribution toregional and global stability  and as a purposefulincentive to encourage increased mutually beneficialcommercial trade and investment among all nations.I wish to underline the significance of mypresence at the current session of the GeneralAssembly. Attached to my attendance are a longhistory  a personal journey and an unbroken linkbetween Namibia and the United Nations over manyyears. I entered this building for the first time in 1960 as a petitioner before the Fourth Committee of theGeneral Assembly.That was my first humble but determinedemergence on the diplomatic scene. I have spent manyyears since then  attending various United Nationsdebates and conferences that dealt with thedecolonization of Namibia and negotiations on self-determination and independence. During those manyyears  I addressed some of the Security Councilmeetings held in respect of the question of Namibia starting in 1971  as the first freedom fighter accordedsuch an opportunity.I got to meet and know many distinguishedstatesmen  diplomats  fellow petitioners and eminentinternational civil servants in New York  Geneva  Parisand other important conference venues. My Namibiancolleagues and I will always treasure the advice support and solidarity we received from the UnitedNations family  and from friends the world over. Manyfriendly nations of the world stood firm and renderedmoral  material and diplomatic support to the noblecause of our freedom and independence.Many world-renowned revolutionaries particularly on the African continent  rendered selflesssacrifices  not only towards the independence of ourmotherland  but also to free the African continent fromcolonial exploitation and apartheid.I therefore would like to salute and pay homageto the visionary leaders of the African continent whoshaped the vision of African unity and the continentísemancipation from the yoke of colonialism  foreignoccupation and apartheid. Among them  I pay specialtribute to Kwame Nkrumah  the first President ofGhana; Ahmed Ben Bella  the first Prime Minister ofAlgeria; Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt; JuliusKambarage Nyerere of Tanzania; Kenneth Kaunda ofZambia; General Murtala Mohammed of Nigeria;Antonio Agostinho Neto of Angola; and other Africanleaders and pan-Africanists.Namibiaís protracted liberation struggle wasbloody and bitter. It caused the untold suffering andsacrifices of our people inside the country and those ofus who were forced to spend many decades in exile.After many years of struggle  the internationalcommunity finally recognized and endorsed thelegitimacy of our cause for freedom  equality andjustice  led by our national liberation movement  theSouth-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) ofNamibia.8Namibia became principally the legalresponsibility of the United Nations  and in that way aunique partnership was forged for a common causebetween the world Organization and the strugglingNamibian people  which endured for 30 daunting andeventful years.On 21 March 1990  His Excellency Javier Perezde Cuellar  then Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  swore me in as President of the Republic ofNamibia. Later in September of the same year  Ireturned to the United Nations to address the GeneralAssembly and  on behalf of my people  to thank theUnited Nations for the special partnership and theprincipled support in various forms that eventuallygave birth to the 160th State Member of ourOrganization.I paid tribute to those United Nations civilservants and members of the United Nations TransitionAssistance Group (UNTAG) who served diligently toensure the full implementation of Security Councilresolution 435 (1978). I also paid homage to those whodied in the course of their duty in Namibia.I wish to recall with appreciation that my initialaccess to the United Nations was made possible bynon-governmental organizations  church groups  ahandful of United Nations staff members andconcerned diplomats from friendly countries. Isincerely thank them all. The Namibian people salutethem and will forever honour the memories we shared.Among those many organizations  I wish toparticularly single out and pay deserved tribute to theAfrica-America Institute for its exceptional dedicationto provide and expand educational opportunities toAfricans across our continent  including Namibians both before and after our independence. I join otherAfrican leaders in welcoming the Africa-AmericaInstituteís fiftieth anniversary education partnershipcampaign  which I wholeheartedly recommend forglobal support.By my own decision and in compliance with ourConstitution  I will be serving as President of theRepublic only until 20 March 2005. I will then bidfarewell to my State duties and public functions. I amlooking forward to a less hectic life  but I will remain afully engaged private citizen. I intend to undertakecertain causes that are dear to my heart and be ready toassist national  regional and international efforts especially in the areas of poverty eradication  peoplewith disabilities  food production and infrastructuredevelopment.At the beginning of my statement  I referred tothe launch of the African Union  NEPAD and Africaísresolve to pursue a new beginning. I now want to addanother crucial dimension  that of gender equality andthe empowerment of women in decision-making andtheir election to national  regional and internationalinstitutions.Our subregional organization  the SouthernAfrican Development Community  spearheaded thisnew thinking  and we are happy that the African Unionhas also started implementing this progressive andforward-looking agenda.The recent inauguration of the Pan-AfricanParliament  which is hosted by South Africa  is alitmus test for Africaís renewal. We must not delay orfail in our joint venture to achieve the total integrationof our continent.The recognition and the full participation ofwomen in decision-making are fundamental to Africaístransformation and industrialization. With that in mind we proudly acknowledge the election of Mrs. GertrudeMongella of Tanzania  who became the first Presidentof the Pan-African Parliament. There is no shortage ofcompetent and experienced African women to lead theway forward. The African Union Commission includesfemale commissioners from various African countries.Africa must place at the top of its agenda theinvolvement and support of women as leaders and rolemodels.Since the days of the Organization of AfricanUnity  the United Nations and Africa have been truepartners. In the process  they have offered one anothermutual support and ever increasing cooperation in thevital fields of conflict resolution  peace-building humanitarian relief and social development. Now thatthe African Union has established its Peace andSecurity Council  in addition to NEPAD  we envisage awider scope for cooperation and resource mobilizationto plan for the prevention of armed conflicts andhuman suffering in Africa.With the attainment of sustained peace andstability  Africaís economic growth and povertyeradication will become a reality and the hopes andaspirations of our people will be realized. To that end 9we need continued and strong partnership with theUnited Nations.From this podium and in various other forums we have reaffirmed our belief in a peaceful democratic  transparent and just international system.We have advocated a system that would bring the poorand the rich of the world together to save the lives ofmillions and pursue sustainable development andhuman security.To achieve that noble objective  the UnitedNations  in particular the Security Council  cannotcontinue operating on the basis of undemocraticstructures of decision-making. The Council should bereformed without delay; political will is what islacking. We can do better. Now is the time. Africaneeds its place as a key player in this world body. Wedemand our share of responsibility.The current war in Iraq has divided the world causing enormous human suffering and undermininginternational peace and security. There is widespreaddistrust among nations  and the danger of nuclearproliferation makes the situation even more alarming.Millions of people in Africa  especially in theGreat Lakes region and the Sudan  continue toexperience untold suffering due to conflict and war.Namibia is deeply concerned about the killings and thehuman rights violations against innocent women children and the elderly in the Darfur region of theSudan. We call on all parties concerned  in particularthe Government of the Sudan  to implement withoutdelay all the agreements and commitments they havemade.Against that background  my Government fullysupports Security Council resolution 1564 (2004) of18 September 2004. While we support the efforts of theAfrican Union to find a peaceful solution to that highlyvolatile situation  we feel strongly that the SecurityCouncil should assume full responsibility inaccordance with the Charter. This problem can beresolved only through a Security Council resolutionestablishing a peacekeeping mission for Sudan  inparticular to deal with human suffering in Darfur. Inthat context  as a product of the United Nationsourselves  and in the light of our commitment to themaintenance of international peace and security Namibia is prepared to contribute a battalion to such aUnited Nations mission.The United Nations Settlement Plan for WesternSahara must be implemented immediately. Likewise the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people must berealized. We  the international community  owe it tothem.Namibia reiterates its call for the immediate andunconditional lifting of the United States embargoagainst Cuba in order to allow the people of the twocountries to coexist peacefully.The global security situation is being furtherthreatened by the emergence of mercenaries  whoundermine legitimate Governments. The Africancontinent has not been spared by this uglyphenomenon  which should be condemned by theinternational community.The United Nations is the ideal place for findingsolutions through multilateral negotiations andcompromise. The Secretary-General needs theunwavering support of all Member States in order toplay an effective role in the Middle East and Africaand in conflict situations around the world. Whetherfighting poverty  HIV/AIDS or terrorism  theinternational community must act as one. We must stophuman suffering and promote security and prosperityfor all.Namibia stands for peace  unity  stability andmutually beneficial economic partnership. OurConstitution is the primary guide we rely on in thosepursuits.My Government is implementing Vision 2030and the successive national development plans instages  with a view to further enhancing economicgrowth and improving the living conditions of ourpeople  including by transforming our villages intoviable socio-economic participants. Poverty  education health care  unemployment  HIV/AIDS  skillsdevelopment  the empowerment of women  theprotection of children and assistance to people withdisabilities are among the urgent national prioritiescovered in those people-centred governmentinterventions.We carry them out in partnership with business labour and those representing civil society. Happily  thecompetent United Nations agencies and internationalexperts based in Namibia are working closely with myGovernment to bring prosperity and transformation toNamibia and the subregion. When we succeed  Africa10will benefit and the world  too  will acknowledge theshared rewards of development partnerships.I conclude my statement in the confidence that through the United Nations  humanity will triumphover the challenges that confront us today so that thefuture generations will live in peace  free from thescourges of war  poverty  hunger and disease. I believestrongly that our common goals and objectives areachievable because a people united  striving to achievea common good for all members of society  will alwaysemerge victorious. Long live the United Nations!"
"125",5067,"NER",59,2004,"Allow me at the outset  Mr. President  to join thosewho have spoken before me in extending warmcongratulations on behalf of my country  my delegationand myself for your brilliant election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. TheChairman of the African Union  His ExcellencyMr. Olusegun Obasanjo  already expressed here a fewdays ago our continent’s gratitude to the internationalcommunity  which  by choosing you  has made one ofAfrica’s most illustrious sons President of the GeneralAssembly. We naturally associate ourselves with thatexpression of gratitude. We wish you every success incarrying out your lofty mission  and you know youhave always had Niger’s support. To your predecessor 21His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte  I should like toexpress our congratulations on the skill  enthusiasmand authority with which he conducted the work of thefifty-eighth session of the Assembly in a difficultinternational context.Today  the international community finds itself ata crossroads. International peace and security —already sorely tested by recurrent armed conflicts —are subjected to threats or bloody attacks of terroristacts  which further darken the global atmosphere ofuncertainty and insecurity. In your opening statement Mr. President  you mentioned one of those persistentand bloody conflicts — that of the Middle East  aconflict that costs so much to humanity in terms ofhuman lives  financial resources and lost hope. Thatregion’s macabre statistics remind us — as if that werestill necessary — of the urgent need to bring the partiesto the negotiating table on the basis of the road map which the Security Council itself endorsed through itsresolution 1515 (2003).Today  in addition to the Palestinian problem andin light of Iraq  the situation in the Middle East iscentral to world peace and security as never before.With respect to Iraq — a country with which Nigershares the same faith  Islam  the basis of our commonmembership in the Organization of the IslamicConference — we cannot fail to deplore so much lossof human life and so much blind violence  which arethe daily lot of the Iraqi people. We earnestly hope thatgreater  revitalized international cooperation willenable us to swiftly establish free and democraticinstitutions in Iraq  put an end to the chaos that seemsto have taken root there and bring to the country thepeace and stability necessary for its socio-economicdevelopment.Niger  as a member of the Organization of theIslamic Conference Contact Group on Jammu andKashmir  believes that a sustained dialogue betweenIndia and Pakistan will make it possible to lay thefoundation for a peaceful solution to that conflict byenabling the people of Kashmir to exercise their rightto self-determination  in accordance with the relevantUnited Nations resolutions.Concerning Western Sahara  Niger reaffirms itssupport for United Nations efforts with a view toreaching a just and comprehensive settlement of theconflict. The commendable actions of the Secretary-General should be continued and supported until wesee a successful conclusion  in conformity with therelevant United Nations resolutions  particularlySecurity Council resolutions 1495 (2003) and1541 (2004).In Niger  at the end of a long and sometimespainful process  we have established a political systemin which a multitude of parties  private media and civilsociety organizations flourish  all of them under theprotective umbrella of a constitution that guaranteesthe separation of powers and an independent judiciary.His Excellency Mr. Tandja Mamadou  President of theRepublic since the democratic elections of22 November 1999  invited the people of Niger on14 September 2004 to vote in new presidential andlegislative elections that will be held starting on13 November 2004. That will be the first time since1991 — when the multiparty system was established inNiger — that a fully democratic mandate has beencompleted. And it will be successfully  because in ourcountry  social peace has returned  State authority hasbeen restored  the economy is back on track and thepeople of Niger have new hope. On 24 July  thebuilding of democratic structures was completedthrough municipal and local elections  to the greatsatisfaction of everyone.The restored status of the State has made itpossible — thanks to the personal intervention ofPresident Tandja Mamadou — to quickly overcome theresistance of the remaining few who were still opposedto the expanded polio vaccination programme. Here  Imust sincerely thank the international community —particularly the World Health Organization  UNICEF the Centres for Disease Control of the United Statesand Rotary International — for having effectivelyassisted us in our efforts in that fight.At the external level  our public and privatebilateral partners who left Niger before 1999 havesince returned. Niger’s presidency of the West AfricanEconomic and Monetary Union and  last year  of theCommunity of Sahelo-Saharan States has given greatervisibility to our external action aimed at peace andsecurity in Africa. In particular  that action has takenthe form of sending a Niger contingent to Côted’Ivoire  military observers to the Democratic Republicof the Congo and civilian police components toBurundi  the Central African Republic and Timor-Leste. All that has convinced us that the internationalcommunity’s support is more essential today than everbefore to help Africa strengthen the capacities of its22subregional institutions and those of its continentalorganization  the African Union.Under the leadership of President OlusegunObasanjo  the African Union is working ceaselessly toprevent conflicts in African countries where peacereigns  to consolidate peace and security where — as inGuinea-Bissau  Sierra Leone or Liberia — thepopulations have barely emerged from a situation ofpolitical instability or bloody armed conflicts  and lastly  to extinguish the hotbeds of tension persisting inCôte d’Ivoire  the Democratic Republic of the Congo Burundi and the Sudan.Our experience with conflict prevention andresolution in Africa teaches us that the golden rule inthat respect is to have confidence in subregionalinstitutions and the African Union and to support themwith consistent logistical and financial means. In thatregard  Niger welcomes the decision taken by theSecurity Council to support the African Union’sdecision to strengthen and expand the observationmission in Darfur and to encourage member States toprovide all the equipment and logistical  financial andmaterial resources required for the mission’s swiftexpansion. We earnestly hope that the various partiesto the conflict will respond positively to the appealscoming from Africa and elsewhere to swiftly put anend to that tragedy and to bring about a comprehensivepeace agreement  on which the advent of a peacefulSudan will depend.Within the framework of Africa’s newdevelopment initiatives  the heads of State of theAfrican Union agreed  during a special summit heldrecently in Ouagadougou  to place employment at thecentre of their political  economic and social policies.As rightly pointed out by His Excellency BlaiseCompaoré  President of Burkina Faso and host of thesummit  Africa needs the effective support of theinternational community to implement the decisions ofOuagadougou.From the Millennium Declaration to the worldconferences and summits that followed it  manyinternational decisions made the fight against poverty aworld priority and a major challenge for humanity.How  then  can it be that hundreds of millions ofpeople continue to languish in abject poverty and totaldestitution? How can it be that  in this era oftechnological and scientific advances  HIV/AIDS andother pandemics continue to wreak havoc throughoutthe world  particularly in Africa? How can it be that  ata time of globalization  many parts of the planet —particularly the least developed countries — are stilltotally excluded from international trade? And how canit be that  despite the commitments undertaken throughthe relevant international conventions  the globalenvironment continues insidiously to deteriorate dangerously jeopardizing the future of generations tocome?In light of that situation  and in view of the dearthof financial resources to address the crucial problemsassailing humanity  we must wonder about theexistence of real political will on the part of richcountries to help the most impoverished countriesovercome abject poverty. The Global Fund to FightAIDS and the World Solidarity Fund for theElimination of Poverty — whose creation wewelcome — suffer from a cruel lack of resources.Furthermore  we believe the modalities forgranting those resources to eligible countries should bemodelled after those in force for the funds obtained inthe framework of the Highly Indebted Poor CountriesInitiative  in order to ensure management that is bothtransparent and responsible.We have to face the reality. Given the economicstagnation  poverty and the lack of prospects that areserious threats for social stability and the youngdemocracies of developing countries  internationalcooperation is the key to achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals — as long as developed anddeveloping countries agree to assume their respectiveresponsibilities. In this respect  the commitments madein Doha to promote a just trade  the MonterreyConsensus on Financing for Development and theJohannesburg Plan of Implementation on SustainableDevelopment remain the cornerstones forimplementation of the Goals.However  the meagre results achieved in theimplementation of conclusions from major forumsprompt the international community as a whole to re-examine its conscience. The upcoming high-leveldialogue on financing for development should be anopportunity to once again place at the core of thedebate the important issue of the mobilization ofresources for development. In this respect  taxation at alevel to be agreed upon — as was recalled at the lastsummit on poverty — on all international financialtransactions could provide the substantial funding so23necessary for attaining the Millennium DevelopmentGoals.Endemic poverty  which affects the Africancontinent in particular  is not a question of fate. It ispossible to reduce poverty as long as the internationalcommunity is resolute in tackling it. It is possible toreduce poverty if industrialized countries implementwithout delay the enhanced programme to alleviate thedebt of highly indebted countries and agree to cancelall bilateral public debts. It is possible to reducepoverty if industrialized countries agree to increaseofficial development assistance to the level necessaryto reach the objectives of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. It is possible to reduce poverty if industrializedcountries resolve to open their markets to commoditiesfrom developing countries  and if raw materials fromthose countries are purchased at their proper values. Itis possible to reduce poverty if industrialized countrieseliminate their farming subsidies for cotton and supportthe countries concerned in their policy for providingrural areas with a suitable farming infrastructure and especially  with small rural facilities.Lastly  it is possible to reduce poverty ifglobalization is better managed and if interdependenceleads to the establishment of an international financialand commercial structure that is democratic and able tomeet the needs of all parties.Not so long ago the international community with the Group of 8 in the lead  solemnly declared itscommitment to support the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). Today we mustacknowledge that that great enthusiasm still has notmaterialized in concrete actions on a scale that wouldmeet the legitimate aspirations of African continent.Despite constant efforts by the African countries  thereis still much left to be done to meet the objectivescontained in that vast and ambitious partnership.I am pleased to say here that Niger is verypleased to work with the Office of the Representativeof the Secretary-General for NEPAD  as well as withthe Office of the High Representative of the UnitedNations for Least Developed Countries  LandlockedCountries and Small Island Developing States.To conclude  it is important that theDesertification Convention be effectively implemented a convention that is seen as the best illustration of thelink between environmental degradation and poverty.Speaking of environmental degradation  how canwe overlook the ecological ravages caused by thecurrent locust invasion in part of Africa? Because it didnot act in good time  the international community —which had been warned of this danger far inadvance — must now mobilize  as soon as possible sufficient financial and material means to stop thespread of the plague in order to halt the spectre offamine that looms over the populations of northernAfrica  the Sahel and West Africa as a whole."
"126",5113,"NGA",59,2004,"On behalf of theGovernment and people of Nigeria  and in my capacityas the current Chairman of the African Union (AU)  Iwould like to extend my sincere congratulations to you Mr. President  on your election as President of thefifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I assureyou of the support and cooperation of Africa  of which10you are an illustrious son. I would also like to expressappreciation to your predecessor  His Excellency TheRight Honourable Julian R. Hunte  Minister forExternal Affairs of Saint Lucia  for the dedication andskill with which he presided over the affairs of thefifty-eighth session. I commend Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan for his effective leadership and for hisefforts to maintain the status of the United Nations inthe face of enormous global challenges.Nigeria remains unshakeable in its commitmentto and support for the strengthening of the United Nationsand the protection of its cherished ideals  in particular themaintenance of international peace and security andcooperation among States to resolve internationaleconomic  social  cultural and humanitarian problems.The problem posed by the unremitting conflicts invarious regions of the world and the increasinglydifficult task of finding solutions to them continue topose serious challenges to the world body.Nigeria and the African Union (AU) commendthe United Nations for its determined engagement incrisis resolution and peacekeeping  particularly inAfrica. We have noted with appreciation the changes inthe concept of peacekeeping. Nevertheless  we believethat some improvements are still necessary to enableUnited Nations peace operations to address the socialand economic challenges that inevitably confrontcountries emerging from conflict. Those socio-economic issues invariably form an important part ofthe original causes of the conflict.We also appeal for continued enhancement of thecapacity of regional organizations to undertake initiativeson crisis resolution in their respective regions. For itspart  the African Union has worked to improve itsMechanism for Conflict Resolution  and in May thisyear established a Peace and Security Council.The first challenge the AU Peace and SecurityCouncil has faced has been the situation in the Darfurregion of western Sudan  which aroused world attentionbecause of the reported carnage there. On behalf of theAU  I want to thank the international community forthe humanitarian intervention being undertaken. As iswell known  the AU has deployed troops to the regionto monitor a ceasefire between the Government of theSudan and the opposing movements — the SudanLiberation Movement/Army and the Justice andEquality Movement. Moreover  the first substantivepeace talks took place under the auspices of the AU inthe Nigerian capital of Abuja from 23 August to18 September 2004. At that meeting  the Sudaneseparties reached agreement on the first of the four pointson the agenda  namely  humanitarian issues. They alsomade progress on the second point  security issues before adjourning for consultations. A follow-upmeeting is expected to be convened in Abuja around21 October 2004 on the other issues: political andeconomic and social issues. I am closely following thedevelopments  in consultation with the Chairperson ofthe Commission of the African Union and others  and Inow call upon the international community to continueto lend us its support in resolving the Darfur conflictand its consequences.It is cheering to note the progress being made inSomalia  particularly in constituting the Parliament.The efforts of the regional countries  which aredemonstrating unprecedented collaboration in helpingthe Somalis to move the process forward  should beapplauded. The Somalis themselves must continue todemonstrate their commitment to repair past errors andto make their country a respectable member of the AUand the United Nations.The Great Lakes region remains a flash point ofviolence  as exemplified by the recent massacre ofmore than 150 persons in a refugee camp in Burundi.On 25 June 2004  President Kabila of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and President Kagame ofRwanda met in Abuja at my invitation and agreed toactivate the Joint Verification Mechanism. Thereafter with the participation of the Secretary-General  ameeting of all stakeholders was held during the thirdAfrican Union Summit  held in Addis Ababa  Ethiopia from 6 to 8 July 2004  in order to accelerate theactivation of the Joint Verification Mechanism. I amhopeful that this renewed process will facilitate a betterunderstanding of how to stem the spate of massacresand engender a peaceful resolution of the protractedcrisis in the Great Lakes region.With regard to the West African subregion  theAfrican Union and the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) are continuing their efforts with the constant support of the United Nations  toensure steady progress in the peace processes in Côted’Ivoire and Liberia. To that end  and in order toaddress the standstill in the implementation of theLinas-Marcoussis Agreement on Côte d’Ivoire  anextraordinary summit was held under ECOWASauspices in Accra  Ghana  on 29 July 2004. The11meeting benefited from the presence of Secretary-General Kofi Annan and some non-ECOWAS Africanheads of State. If the agreements reached at thatsummit are faithfully implemented  an end to theconflict should be in sight.In the margins of the Accra summit  we alsoaddressed problems that were retarding theimplementation of the Liberian Comprehensive PeaceAgreement. In discussions with all the Liberianleaders  we agreed decisions on the main issues  andwe have since witnessed encouraging signs that thosedecisions are being implemented.Here  I should like to remark once again that thedelay in providing the resources promised by countriesduring the Liberian pledging conference held at UnitedNations Headquarters in February 2004 constitutes anavoidable hindrance to the advancement of peace inLiberia. I therefore call on all our well-meaningpartners who were kind enough to make pledges tokindly redeem them.While the United Nations is justifiably seized ofthe issue of weapons of mass destruction — such asnuclear  chemical and biological weapons — the questionof small arms and light weapons can no longer beignored. While the threat of weapons of massdestruction is awesome  small arms and light weaponsare killing people every day at a rate that cumulatively  amounts to monumental destruction.Nigeria and the African Union welcome thecommencement of negotiations on a legally bindinginternational instrument to enable States to identify andtrace illicit small arms and light weapons globally. Ofparticular interest to Africa is the enormous potentialthat such a legally binding instrument can have onpeace and security in our region. We should thereforenot relent in our efforts.Let me take this opportunity to soundly condemnthe totally unacceptable role of mercenaries and theirsponsors in Africa. The recent attempted invasion ofEquatorial Guinea and other such attempts go againstevery imaginable rational effort at promoting stabilityand democracy on the continent. We call on the UnitedNations to join the African Union in sending the rightsignals of condemnation to those mercenaries and theirsponsors.Our quest for global peace and security willprove unsuccessful unless we intensify internationalcooperation for development and the reduction ofpoverty. Just four years ago  we adopted theMillennium Development Goals  which pointedly fixedthe target of reducing by half the number of thoseliving in poverty by 2015. Yet by now  the alarm isbeing raised that  if present trends continue  that targetmay not be met  particularly in Africa  which asidefrom the challenges of development  is also beingravaged by pandemic diseases.Speaking on behalf of the African Union as itscurrent Chairperson  I should like to assure the GeneralAssembly that we Africans are determined to exert allour efforts to overcome those obstacles to developmentthat are within our control. To that end  we arepursuing  with the personal commitment andinvolvement of our heads of State and Governmentthemselves  the implementation of the priorities set outin our flagship programme  the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD).In that context  we appreciate the conclusion inthe Secretary-General’s second consolidated report onprogress in implementation and international supportfor NEPAD that“African countries have demonstrated theircommitment to advancing the implementation ofNEPAD by earmarking financial allocations toselected sectoral priorities.” (A/59/206  para. 67)The report also concludes that“The development partners of Africa cangive further practical expression to their supportfor the efforts of African countries by takingaction in three important areas: first  by creatingan enabling international environment that issupportive of growth and development in Africa;second  by bringing much needed coherence totrade  aid and debt policies  so that Africancountries are the net beneficiaries of internationalactions in those areas; and third  by undertakingconcrete measures to accelerate theimplementation of NEPAD by making significantfinancial outlays to fund the key sectoralpriorities of NEPAD.” (ibid.  para. 68)I believe that the message to our developmentpartners is very clear. To demonstrate our commitmentto the principles of good governance  transparency andthe rule of law  23 African countries have alreadysubscribed to the African Peer Review Mechanism. Itshould be recalled that the Mechanism represents12Africa’s voluntary commitment to a set of performancecodes and standards to foster best practices and sharelessons in the management of national affairs. Thepromotion of agriculture is being vigorously pursuedboth for its export potential and for poverty alleviation.Encouraging growth rates in agricultural productionare already being recorded in several African countries.Simultaneously  we are intensifying our efforts in thepromotion of agro-based industries.To further our efforts at self-help  the heads ofState and Government of the African Union held theExtraordinary Summit on Employment and PovertyAlleviation in Ouagadougou  Burkina Faso  from 5 to9 September 2004. We adopted a far-reachingdeclaration and programme of action. We also adoptedmechanisms for implementation and monitoring at thenational  regional and continental levels.What may act as an obstacle to implementation inthis most important area for lifting the Africanpopulation out of poverty and misery is the inevitableissue of having adequate resources for meeting ourotherwise realistic goals. On behalf of the AfricanUnion  I appeal to our partners to act once again in theinterest of our shared  common global interdependenceand common humanity.Africa requires a genuine partnership anchored onthe principle of mutual benefits to ensure theattainment of sustainable development. One area ofpartnership concerns Africa’s external debts. Thenegative impact of debt on the economic situation ofAfrican countries  particularly the least developedcountries  can no longer be denied. We remainconvinced that comprehensively resolving the lingeringdebt crisis through innovative action would brightenthe prospects of development in Africa.Africa welcomes the consensus that emergedfrom the recent meeting of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development in São Paulo Brazil. That consensus reflects a shared conviction thatthe Organization can continue to coordinate our viewson trade and development matters. This cannot beotherwise if the Millennium Development Goals are tobe achieved and the benefits of expanding trade are tobe enjoyed by all peoples and societies.By launching a new initiative to commence a newround of multilateral trade negotiations  developingcountries have issued a challenge to our developmentpartners to exploit global opportunities for growth anddevelopment. We hope they will respond.Africa remains committed to the fight against theHIV/AIDS pandemic  malaria  tuberculosis and relateddiseases. Since the last series of high-level plenarymeetings on implementation of the Declaration ofCommitment on HIV/AIDS  we have taken bold stepsto deal with the pandemic. Towards that end  we inNigeria have established a national scientific institutefor research on HIV/AIDS and intensified publicawareness programmes. In that connection  wewelcome the outcome of the recent InternationalConference on HIV/AIDS in Bangkok  Thailand. Wethank the United Nations agencies and all stakeholdersfor their collective efforts to stem the spread of thedisease worldwide.With regard to other deadly preventable diseases such as malaria  tuberculosis  polio and whoopingcough  my Government has stepped up its efforts. In afew days  on 2 October 2004  my Government willonce again embark on a polio immunizationprogramme  in coordination with six African States —Chad  the Sudan  Cameroon  Niger  Burkina Faso andCôte d’Ivoire — to ensure maximum effectiveness.These are countries where polio has been reportedfairly recently. Significantly and symbolically  theprogramme’s launch  with all my brothers andcolleagues present  will take place in Kano.Last year  the Secretary-General launched aUnited Nations reform initiative that we all warmlycommended. In pursuit of that initiative  the Secretary-General appointed last year a high-level Panel of EminentPersonalities to examine ways of strengthening theUnited Nations through institutional reforms andprocesses. We are looking forward to the report of thePanel. Nigeria — and indeed the rest of Africa — holdsthe view that the Security Council should be expanded inits permanent and non-permanent categories to make itmore representative  more effective and moreacceptable. We hope that those regions of the worldthat are not currently represented in the permanentmembership category will be given membership.Africa  whose issues occupy a substantial part of theSecurity Council’s time  ought to be accorded priorityconsideration for permanent membership  and Nigeria I strongly believe  is a well-qualified candidate."
"127",5158,"NIC",59,2004,"Inthe middle of the nineteenth century railroads werebuilt all over the world. Steel at that time was not ofsuch good quality and for that reason wheelssometimes broke  causing accidents and derailments.To avoid those accidents  at every station stop therewas a brakeman who walked the length of the tracks hammer in hand  hammering on the wheels so that anyof the wheels that sounded broken could be changed.Years passed and the quality of steel improved  but thebrakemen kept hammering on the wheels  heedless ofthe fact that it was no longer necessary.The world changes  and that means that we  too need to change in order to adapt to new circumstances.Something similar is happening in the United Nations.The Security Council  designed after the Second WorldWar to maintain peace in the post-war world  is not theSecurity Council that the new century of informationtechnology and globalization needs. We must reinventthe United Nations.4Let us begin by making the reform of the UnitedNations  on which we have already agreed  effective.We have to broaden participation in the SecurityCouncil to include other countries  both as permanentmembers — which at the very least should includeGermany and Japan — and as non-permanentmembers  in order to allow for more equitable anddemocratic representation.Our Organization needs to adapt to the newchallenges and realities of the present. Development for example  needs a new approach. What concerns usmost is to ensure that populations and individualsparticipate more actively in the decisions shaping theirown future. As I said three days ago  in the “ActionAgainst Hunger and Poverty” meeting of worldleaders  development is a responsibility of States  but itis also the primary responsibility of the individual.I find the words of Nobel Laureate JoséSaramago are appropriate here when he writes:“As vehemently as we claim our rights  let usalso lay claim to responsibility for our duties.Perhaps then the world will become a bit better.”So it was a wise thing that our AmericanDeclaration of the Rights and Duties of Man  signed inBogotá in 1948  established that equal to  and as acounterpart to rights  there are also individualresponsibilities.That includes instilling in the conscience ofcitizens a culture of responsibility. Next to the right toreceive a State-sponsored education stands the civilresponsibility to make the most effective use of thateducation and to obtain at least a primary education.Next to the right of children to have a father and amother stands the duty of parents to care for  help feed  educate and shelter their young children.Children  for their part  have the responsibility alwaysto honour their parents  help them  feed them and givethem shelter when they are in need. Next to the right toemployment stands the duty to provide efficientservice. Everyone has the responsibility to work  eachaccording to his ability and possibilities  in order toobtain the resources for survival  thus achievingpersonal progress and social development.Along with the right to health goes theresponsibility to contribute to a healthy and cleanenvironment. With the right to enjoy the benefits ofprogress goes the responsibility to contribute todevelopment. With the right to the freedom ofexpression goes the responsibility of toleratingdiffering opinions. In short  every right has acorresponding duty or responsibility.With the fall of the Berlin wall  the age in whichthe State was expected to be responsible for everythingcame to a close. Today  we must all participate togetherin the search for new paths for our individualdevelopment and for that of our countries and of allhumanity.The passing of time motivates us to renew ourbasic principles. I therefore propose that we once againadopt an ethic of development based principally onindividual responsibility as well as on theresponsibility of nations.The well-being and the development of nationsare the result of individual well-being and thedevelopment of the people that make up that society.Social well-being should not be measured by howmany people are assisted by social programmesfinanced from national budgets but by how manypeople leave those programmes because they havebecome able to manage on their own.In his book  Underdevelopment is a State ofMind  Lawrence Harrison defines a negative attitude asa barrier to development and a positive attitude —based on the belief in one’s own ability to improveoneself through individual effort — as a driving forceof development.In order to bolster all the elements I have cited  itis essential that the right to accede to public officeshould be accompanied by the responsibility to carryout one’s duties honestly. At the current session of theGeneral Assembly  several heads of State haveemphasized the need to fight corruption. It is aresponsibility that has rightly been gaining ground.In Nicaragua  we have undertaken the arduousfight against corruption. First  corrupt bureaucrats havebeen brought to trial and sentenced  just as ishappening in other Latin American countries.Secondly  we have brought before the NationalAssembly a body of legislation to strengthen our fightagainst corruption.Thirdly  we have established a programme forintegrity and transparency that prevents corruptpractices in the executive branch and which provides amodel for the other branches of Government in5undertaking reform and increasing transparency. Forexample  we have published on the Internet  foreveryone to see — for the countries extendingassistance  international organizations and themedia — both the Republic’s national budget and thedetails of external assistance.Fourthly  we have undertaken to fight the cultureof corruption  including by teaching values andpromoting the idea of the individual as the maker of hisor her own destiny.We must work for a United Nations that reaffirmsits credibility and authority by taking the appropriateeffective collective action. Nicaragua recognizes theimportance of the proposals various countries havesubmitted to this forum  in particular Spain’s proposalto reduce external debt in exchange for initiatives forsocial development  particularly in the area of primaryeducation  and the United States proposal to create afund for democracy. Nicaragua views with approvalthat such a democracy fund would be partiallyallocated to training and support for auditing andjudicial entities  given that corruption is the greatestfoe of democracy. As Secretary-General Kofi Annansaid yesterday  “They notice when we use words tomask inaction”. Nicaragua’s energy and determinationare devoted to those efforts.Recent world events have demonstrated onceagain the evil nature of terrorism and how it breaksdown the values of humanity and civilization. Ireiterate my most sincere condolences to all thosecountries and individuals around the world that havesuffered the effects of terrorism.I underline that we deplore  to cite only the mostrecent acts  those who caused the loss of the preciouslives of innocent children in the Russian Federation.We also repudiate the attack against the AustralianEmbassy in Jakarta.The best way to defeat terrorism is to remainfaithful to our values of freedom  dignity and justice.Terrorism rejects those values.Nicaragua aspires to be elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for 2006and 2007. Nicaragua  a founding country of theOrganization  has known and suffered the horrors ofwar and has undertaken the democratization of ournation. It is by virtue of the valuable school of ourrecent history that we can participate in the SecurityCouncil. As I stated in this forum last year  whoeverknows the horrors of war can contribute moreeffectively to preventing it.I cannot fail to refer to the question of Taiwan’srepresentation in the United Nations. That country with 23 million inhabitants  has a democraticGovernment and maintains diplomatic  trade andcooperative relations with many Member States of theOrganization. However  paradoxically  it lacksmembership. That exclusion is inexcusable.At the beginning of this session  we heard the sadmessages from Haiti and the Dominican Republic which have suffered the devastating effects of nature. Iconvey our solidarity  encouragement and hope tothose countries and to the victims of natural disastersin the United States  Grenada  Jamaica  Panama  theBahamas  Cuba  Grand Cayman and other islands ofthe Caribbean.This afternoon  I began my address by speakingof the responsibilities of citizens. That is the way forour peoples to attain their hopes  expectations anddreams.May God bless the United Nations and may Godalways bless Nicaragua."
"128",5205,"NLD",59,2004,"It is an honour for me toaddress the fifty-ninth session of the General Assemblyof the United Nations on behalf of the European Union(EU).With its 25 member States  the European Unionrepresents 13 per cent of the United Nationsmembership and accounts for almost 30 percent of theworld’s economy. Our contributions to the UnitedNations go further; EU member States pay more than36 per cent of the United Nations regular budget andabout half of all voluntary contributions to the UnitedNations Funds and Programmes. They contribute morethan 50 000 troops to United Nations-led and UnitedNations-authorized international peace missions.We in the EU are proud of our contribution to theUnited Nations and to international cooperation. Butwe are not complacent. We understand that our securityand prosperity are inextricably linked to the fate ofothers  and we know that we cannot isolate ourselvesfrom cross-border threats and challenges. We realizethat climate change does not respect nationality ethnicity or religion  that HIV/AIDS knows no bordersand that terrorists kill indiscriminately. No nation canrespond to these threats in isolation; the only wayforward is through collective action.In a world of global threats  global markets andglobal media  our security and prosperity depend more28and more on an effective multilateral system. Thesearch for a strong  rule-based international society ismore imperative than ever.We welcome the Secretary-General’s call to workharder to strengthen the rule of law for all. His agendais our agenda. That is why reform of the UnitedNations  with a view to making it stronger  moreeffective and more efficient  is a high priority for theEuropean Union. The Union remains committed tomultilateralism and a rule-based international order with the United Nations at its core. What gives greatstrength to the United Nations is its legitimacy. It hasno substitute in the international community. It isunique. But the Organization must adapt to changingcircumstances. The reform efforts that have alreadybeen set in motion by the Secretary-General must beintensified and deepened with a view to making theUnited Nations stronger  more effective and moreefficient.The EU looks forward to the report of the High-Level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change and tothe Secretary-General’s recommendations that will besubmitted to the General Assembly. Next year  theGeneral Assembly will meet at the highest level toreview progress in honouring all of the commitmentsof the United Nations Millennium Declaration. Thereview must be comprehensive  balanced and effective.The summit must deal with the major  interlinked concerns of peace  security  poverty and sustainabledevelopment. The recommendations in the report of theWorld Commission on the Social Dimension ofGlobalization are an important contribution to thereview.We have committed ourselves to combatingpoverty and promoting sustainable development. TheMillennium Development Goals must be achieved.Urgent action is called for. Both developing anddeveloped countries must put in place a range ofmeasures  as agreed at the Monterrey Conference onFinancing for Development including: goodgovernance; expansion of trade opportunities  inparticular for developing countries; and an increase inofficial development assistance. The European Unionis committed to those objectives. It is very much ontrack for increasing its official development assistance(ODA) to 0.39 per cent of gross national product(GNP) in 2006 as part of a longer-term effort to raiseits ODA contributions to 0.7 per cent of GNP.Combating HIV/AIDS must be an integral part ofour global campaign against poverty. As one of themost devastating pandemics in human history HIV/AIDS is literally a disease of mass destruction: adisease which strikes 10 people every minute. In Africaespecially  AIDS is tearing the fabric of society apart.Fighting that disaster is a priority for us all.Prevention of HIV/AIDS is inextricably linked tosexual and reproductive health and rights. We wish toreaffirm our commitment to the agenda of theInternational Conference on Population andDevelopment and will do so again at the tenthanniversary commemoration on 14 October.Reproductive health and rights are an essential part ofdevelopment.One of the greatest threats to international peaceand security today is the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction and their means of delivery. Theinternational community must address that challengeeffectively. The EU adopted a comprehensive andcoherent strategy against the proliferation of thoseweapons last December  covering a wide spectrum ofmeasures. The EU is guided by the conviction that amultilateral approach to security is the best way tomaintain international order. That is why we are firmlycommitted to uphold  implement and strengthenmultilateral disarmament and non-proliferation treatiesand agreements. The multilateral treaty systemprovides the legal and normative basis for all non-proliferation efforts.International treaty regimes and export controlarrangements are in place to prevent the spread ofweapons of mass destruction and their deliverysystems. Those instruments  however  have notsucceeded in putting a complete stop to proliferation.Additional measures are necessary  in particular tocombat the risk of terrorist organizations gainingaccess to those weapons and delivery systems. In thatregard  the EU welcomes the adoption of SecurityCouncil resolution 1540 (2004)  which is fully in linewith the EU strategy.With others  the European Union will alsoexplore the possibility of establishing a closerelationship between the United Nations and the HagueInternational Code of Conduct against Ballistic MissileProliferation.Terrorism is another threat that can be dealt withonly by effective multilateralism and close29international cooperation. Terrorists’ capacity to strikeis still very substantial  as shown by the heinousattacks in several countries over the past year. I wish toreiterate that the European Union utterly condemns allterrorist acts  irrespective of their alleged motivations and to express our profound solidarity with the victimsof such acts.The European Union welcomes the developmentof the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate  whichwill strengthen the ability of the United Nations tooversee implementation of anti-terrorism resolutionsand conventions. Obviously  the United Nations can doits work well only if Member States honour theircommitments and assume their responsibilities.Equipping the United Nations to deal with terrorismalso demands readiness to act in situations in whichStates cannot or do not wish to implement theirinternational obligations in the fight against terrorism.This brings me to the issue of human rights —another common concern. Human rights lie at the coreof the work of the United Nations. The EuropeanUnion fully agrees with Secretary-General Annan’sstatement that terrorism must not be used as an excuseto trample on human rights. States must ensure that anymeasures taken to combat terrorism comply with theirobligations under international law  in particularinternational human rights  refugee and humanitarianlaw. We must protect the universal values andfundamental freedoms whose enjoyment is seriouslyimpaired by acts of terrorism.The European Union is a committed supporter ofinitiatives to improve the implementation of humanrights obligations worldwide and at country level. TheEuropean Union recognizes the responsibility of theinternational community to protect mankind fromgenocide  war crimes and grave and massive violationsof human rights. The European Union welcomes theintroduction of a human rights-based approach in thework of all United Nations agencies and programmes.That will ensure that United Nations assistanceactivities contribute to achieving such rights foreveryone everywhere. Our own initiatives in that areaoften complement and strengthen those initiated withinthe United Nations framework. We especially welcomethe close cooperation between the European Union andthe United Nations special mechanism in respect ofchildren in armed conflict and human rights defenders.The valuable work being done by the UnitedNations  particularly by the Special Rapporteur ontorture  in pursuit of the prevention and eradication ofall forms of torture  is strongly recommended andsupported by the EU. The European Union would alsolike to take this opportunity to reaffirm its oppositionto the death penalty.The European Union stresses the importance ofthe International Criminal Court in putting an end toimpunity and strengthening the rule of law throughoutthe world. It will pursue its efforts to ensure the widestpossible ratification of  and accession to  the RomeStatute of the International Criminal Court.The world needs a United Nations that canintervene decisively to prevent  limit and put an end tomilitary conflicts. An estimated 40 per cent ofcountries emerging from civil wars relapse into conflictwithin five years. The lesson — familiar but oftenforgotten — is that the United Nations system must bebetter attuned to how such conflicts can be preventedand peace preserved. No matter how difficult preventing conflict and preserving a precarious peaceis less costly than intervening in a full-blown conflict.The European Union is aware of its responsibilityin that area and is increasing its capabilities to maintainits already significant contribution to conflictprevention  international crisis management andpeacekeeping operations. It will also continue to assistother regional organizations to enhance their own crisismanagement capabilities. The United Nations mustintensify its cooperation with those organizations  inpart with a view to enhancing their capacity for crisismanagement  in accordance with Chapter VIII of theCharter. To that end  the European Union is workingwith the United Nations Secretariat to implement theJoint Declaration on United Nations-EU Cooperationin Crisis Management of September 2003.Several regional issues warrant special attention.The Middle East peace process must be put back ontrack. That means that the entire internationalcommunity must back the road map — the only road toan agreed negotiated two-State solution. The EuropeanUnion and its Quartet partners will remain engaged inthe search for a settlement. The European Union thinksthat the Assembly can make an important contributionto that objective by focusing on substantive issues inthe peace process and adopting a pragmatic andconstructive approach towards this problem.30The Security Council’s unanimous adoption ofresolution 1546 (2004) marks the restoration ofsovereignty to Iraq. The European Unionwholeheartedly supports the political process and thenew Iraqi Interim Government and calls on all MemberStates to do the same. It gives its full backing to theholding of democratic elections in January 2005. It iscommitted to unwavering support of the pivotal UnitedNations role in that country. The Iraqi people havesuffered so much and deserve the chance to have abetter life. Let us offer them that chance.In a similar vein  the process of securing stability reconstruction and democratization in Afghanistanmust remain an international priority. The Afghans aredesperate for peace. They demand a say in theircountry’s future. Over 10 million Afghans  more than40 per cent of them women  have registered to vote inthe presidential elections on 9 October. There can beno better sign of their enthusiasm for democracy. TheEuropean Union will continue its political and financialassistance to Afghanistan and its people.Developments in Africa are cause for bothoptimism and concern. Increasingly  Africans aretaking responsibility for solving the problems of theircontinent. The progress of the African Union inestablishing its architecture for peace and security is acase in point. The European Union will use its AfricanPeace Facility to help the African Union build capacityto engage in peace support and peacekeepingoperations.The European Union will closely cooperate withthe African Union  the United Nations  the ArabLeague and the United States with a view toharmonizing international efforts to contain andresolve the conflict in Darfur. It will continue tosupport the efforts of the United Nations  in particularby the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.The European Union expresses its concern overthe recent increase in tensions in the Great Lakesregion and calls on all countries in the region to adhereto the Declaration of Principles on Good-NeighbourlyRelations and Cooperation. It remains our convictionthat the resolution of conflicts in the Great Lakesregion requires a regional approach. In the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  the European Union supports amore focused and robust mandate of the UnitedNations Organization Mission in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo (MONUC) and relatedincreased capabilities. It is actively examining differentoptions for continued support to United Nations effortsto strengthen MONUC.Also  the European Union remains deeplyconcerned about the situation in Zimbabwe and urgesthat the Government of Zimbabwe establish theconditions for and hold free and fair elections in linewith the Southern African Development Community’s(SADC) August 2004 electoral guidelines.Many courageous men and women are trying tomake a difference under the blue flag of the UnitedNations. Last year’s bombing in Baghdad was a tragicdemonstration of the fact that the work of the UnitedNations is often dangerous. The European Unionsupports the Secretary-General’s efforts to improve thesafety and security of United Nations staff. We arekeen to discuss his proposals. Through our policies actions  and resources  we  the Member States  bear theresponsibility of making it possible for the UnitedNations to go where it should.The European Union itself is an example ofmultilateralism at work. Conflicting interests anddiverging views still exist within the European Union as they do everywhere. But conflicts are resolvedwithin the framework of common institutions andbinding rules. Multilateralism works. A rule-basedinternational order is possible. And necessary. TheEuropean Union will strive to achieve that goaleverywhere."
"129",5250,"NOR",59,2004,"When we met here inthe General Assembly last year  it was against thebackdrop of the terrible and devastating attack on theUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad. This year weare meeting after a number of terrorist attacks  mostrecently the gruesome terrorist attack on children ontheir very first day of school in Beslan  Russia.Terrorism is not a new threat. But the scale andbrutality of recent terrorist operations have altered ourlives and our thinking and forced us to take newmeasures to protect ourselves against this threat.Terrorism can strike anywhere and at any time.Terrorism is a threat to our security; it creates fear andwant  and severely hampers economic and socialdevelopment. No cause  however legitimate  can justifyacts of terrorism.The fight against terrorism must continue to be atop priority for the United Nations and the worldcommunity. We must act in accordance withinternational law and human rights. Democratic valuesand the rule of law are our strongest cards in the fightagainst terror.We  the Members of the United Nations  have aresponsibility to make the Organization robust enoughto address the many tasks we have assigned it. Thechallenges are many. Unified efforts are needed tobring peace and stability to Iraq. Security Councilresolution 1546 (2004) stresses that the internationalcommunity must help the new Iraqi Government in itscurrent effort to create a better future. However functional national democracies and constitutionalinstitutions are not created by United Nationsresolutions. In Iraq  they can be created only by theIraqis themselves. The international community andthe United Nations can  and should  facilitate and assistin this process  provided that the necessary security isensured. Our Government fully supports the efforts ofthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General Ashraf Qazi  and his team of dedicated women andmen.Afghanistan is at a critical juncture. More than1 000 people  both Afghans and internationals  havebeen killed there so far this year. Reconstruction effortsand efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to themost vulnerable are being hampered. Developmentactivities are key elements in ensuring stability andsecurity. Without security there will be no progress and without progress there will be no security. There isa continued need for international security forces. Thepolitical process leading to elections is anotheressential requirement for stability. The United Nationsmust continue to play an important role.22While the world is waiting for a political solutionto the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians  thesituation continues to worsen. The construction of theseparation barrier and the expansion of settlements areserious threats to the two-State solution.The Israeli plan to withdraw from Gaza and foursettlements in the West Bank could be a step in theright direction if it is implemented in accordance withthe road map and Security Council resolutions  and inkeeping with the vision of a two-State solution.A viable and well-functioning PalestinianAuthority is critical to a peaceful solution to theconflict. The Palestinian leaders themselves mustcontribute by implementing reforms as set out in theroad map. The Palestinian Authority has a clearresponsibility to fight Palestinian terrorism.In my capacity as Chairman of the Ad HocLiaison Committee for Assistance to the PalestinianPeople  I am encouraged by the many statements that Ihave heard to the effect that the internationalcommunity stands ready to assist in the implementationof the planned withdrawal. However  key issues mustbe addressed. Most importantly  withdrawal from Gazamust be carried out in a way that is conducive to thenormalization of the Palestinian economy.Norway  together with other partners in the AdHoc Liaison Committee  will host a donor conferencebefore the end of the year. I appeal to the StatesMembers of the United Nations to support thePalestinian Authority.In Darfur we are facing another crisis  which isfirst and foremost a question of the safety and securityof the civilian population  humanitarian access and theprovision of food  medicine and shelter. The concern ofthe international community was expressed in SecurityCouncil resolution 1564 (2004)  adopted on Saturday.All armed groups must cease the violence. TheNorwegian Government expects the Sudaneseauthorities to fully comply with Security Councilresolutions.The Darfur crisis makes it even more important tocontinue the Naivasha peace process. A comprehensivepeace agreement for southern Sudan will lay thefoundation for a national solution to the political issuesin Darfur. We welcome the decision to resume the talksbetween the Government of the Sudan and the SudanPeople’s Liberation Army in Kenya. We urge them towork without delay to conclude a comprehensive peaceagreement.Targeting humanitarian personnel in conflictareas is absolutely unacceptable. Such acts of violenceconstitute grave breaches of international humanitarianlaw. We are being forced to rethink our approach tosecurity. It is important  however  to avoid a situationwhere overly strict security measures prevent theUnited Nations from acting effectively on the ground.Such rules might further distance the civilianpopulation and therefore result in a loss of legitimacyand local support.Providing security for United Nations personnelis not without costs. When we ask the United Nationsto carry out difficult tasks in unsafe environments  wemust also be willing to cover the expenses involved.We look forward to the Secretary-General’srecommendations on the basis of the report of theHigh-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change.That report will come at a crucial point in time for theUnited Nations. The United Nations needs to takeearlier and more coordinated action as threats to peaceand security emerge. Such action also needs to besustained in a coordinated and effective fashion.We agree that our collective security systemneeds reform. Such reform must include  among otherissues  the sensitive question of Security Councilenlargement. We hope that a broad set of concreterecommendations by the High-level Panel will enableus to agree on measures to better meet current and newthreats and challenges. The Panel should take care toensure that both hard and soft security issues areaddressed  as well as the linkages between them.Member States have the responsibility to ensure thatthe Secretary-General’s recommendations  based on thereport of the Panel  are actively followed up.The resolution of armed conflicts is not solely theprovince of the United Nations. Regional organizationsalso have significant contributions to make — and theircapacities should be strengthened. The United Nationsis indispensable in delivering legitimacy. Regionalorganizations  with their local knowledge  are wellplaced to meet challenges on the ground. Yet theinstitutional mechanisms for ensuring effectivepartnership and real burden-sharing between the UnitedNations and regional organizations are not in place.This situation must be rectified.23A case in point is the involvement of the AfricanUnion (AU) in Sudan. Norway welcomes the responseto the Darfur crisis by the AU and its member States.The AU mission must be enhanced both by becomingmore pro-active and by increasing the number ofparticipants. Norway has supported the AU and theUnited Nations in providing security and humanitarianrelief in Darfur. We stand ready to continue to supportthose efforts.I believe that strengthening Africa’s capacity forpeacekeeping and peace-building is essential if we areto deal with the challenges that United Nationspeacekeeping is facing. For nearly ten years  Norwayhas contributed to peacekeeping through our Trainingfor Peace in Southern Africa Programme. We plan toexpand that programme to West Africa.It is uplifting to see the progress being made inmany African countries. We applaud the basicprinciples and political priorities being addressed bythe New Partnership for Africa’s Development andwelcome last week’s inauguration of the Pan-AfricanParliament. This strengthening of the politicaldimension of regional cooperation testifies to thededication of African leaders and holds promise of aneven more active and efficient role for the AU in theyears to come.Without economic growth there will be noimprovement in welfare and wealth distribution  andlittle hope of peace and security. International trademay be an important engine for creating growth andwelfare. However  this will not happen by itself. Asound basis for growth and welfare that benefits allcountries can be created only by means of fair traderules developed through international cooperation. Inthis respect  the World Trade Organization frameworkagreement reached in Geneva in July is a milestone.We avoided any deadlock or setback  and now we canrenew our efforts to achieve substantial progress on theDoha Development Agenda. I noted that in his speech President Lula da Silva said that “If successful  theDoha Round could lift more than 500 million peopleout of poverty”. This certainly shows the opportunitiesof globalization. However  ensuring that economicgrowth actually improves the livelihoods of ordinarypeople requires adequate domestic policies.In an ever more globalized world  we needforums to develop the international guidelinesnecessary to facilitate cooperation. However  we allneed to do our part. It has been 10 years since theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange entered into force. More than 120 countrieshave ratified the Kyoto Protocol  and we are nowawaiting the ratification that will allow it to enter intoforce. I welcome the news that Russia is seriouslyconsidering the ratification of the Protocol  but I regretthat some countries have not yet been willing to joinforces in facing one of the most serious globalchallenges of our time.Fulfilling the requirements of the Kyoto Protocolis a first step towards coming to grips with thechallenge of climate change. The entire internationalcommunity  and notably the largest emitters  mustmake a much more ambitious commitment in this field;we have no time to lose. In the Arctic region we arealready experiencing the effects of climate change asseen in a temperature rise that is substantially greaterthan the global average.Next year we will take stock of developmentssince the Millennium Declaration was adopted. This isan opportunity to review progress and  wherenecessary  intensify efforts to fulfil our commitment toreducing poverty and achieving development. Truegender equality and education for all stand out ascrucial in this regard. The Summit in 2005 should alsofocus on international efforts to promote peace-building  reconciliation  global security and respect forhuman rights. We must take decisive steps during thenext General Assembly to meet development targetsand create a safer and more peaceful world.The United Nations is indispensable as our mostuniversal and representative organization. Norway hasdevoted a great deal of effort to building themultilateral system. We are proud of our political andfinancial contributions to the United Nations system.We are eager to see the United Nations strengthenedand reshaped  so that it can remain our most importantinstrument for addressing global challenges. Norwayremains committed to supporting the United Nations inmeeting those challenges."
"130",5296,"NPL",59,2004,"Allow me to congratulateyou  Mr. President  on your well-deserved election topreside over the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly. I assure you of my delegation’s fullcooperation in the discharge of your important duties.Allow me to also pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Julian R. Hunte  Minister for External Affairs ofSaint Lucia  for his outstanding leadership in theAssembly’s last session. Our full appreciation goes tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisinvaluable and wise stewardship of the United Nations.I also wish to express  on behalf of His Majesty’sGovernment and the people of Nepal  our sincerecondolences to the Governments  countries and peoplesthat have suffered the consequences of hurricanes andterrorist attacks in recent weeks and months.We live in one of the most turbulent periods sincethe Second World War. The end of the cold warunleashed forces of democracy and economicopenness  and the revolution in science  andtechnology has converted the world into a globalvillage by shrinking distances and increasingconnectivity. In tandem with this came many negativeconsequences. Internal conflicts have proliferated andpopulations have been displaced. Internationalterrorism has increased. Globalization has widened thegap between the rich and the poor. Poverty  ignorance disease and injustice have persisted and even worsenedfor the majority of humanity. Transnational crimeshave spread their wings. No country is immune fromthe impact of these huge problems facing humanitytoday. Addressing these problems is a challenge thatrequires collective action by the internationalcommunity in a spirit of multilateralism. The UnitedNations has the legitimacy and mandate to promotemultilateral solutions to the shared problems of ourtime.Indeed  the United Nations embodies all ofhumanity’s shared dreams and its hopes for peace security and development. Nepal has abiding faith inthe principles and objectives enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter  and we recognize the central role ofthe United Nations in the pursuit of those shareddreams.The emerging international situation is fraughtwith a multitude of challenges. Internal conflicts haveafflicted countries from Iraq to Burundi and from Haitito the Sudan. Terrorism has become a global menace casting a dark shadow over the lives of millions ofpeople around the globe. Deadly weapons pose aconstant threat to the safety of human beings and thevery existence of human civilization.By all accounts  the situation in Iraq is highlyvolatile and extremely dangerous. The Nepalese peoplehave yet to overcome their revulsion over the brutalkilling of 12 innocent Nepalese hostages on 31 Augustin that country. We strongly condemn this dastardlycrime committed by the terrorists. It is our fervent hopethat the Iraqi people will be able to improve theirsecurity environment  hold the scheduled elections on9time and live in a free  secure  democratic andprosperous Iraq.The Middle East is caught in a cycle of violence.To break this cycle  both Israel and Palestine will haveto exercise maximum restraint and engage in fruitfuldialogue to build the mutual confidence critical forimplementing the Quartet-endorsed road map  whichoffers a viable and durable two-State solution. Nepalsupports the road map and views the Israeli plan to pullout of Gaza as a positive step.Though the security situation has improved overtime  Afghanistan is far from secure  and itsreconstruction is far from satisfactory. The worldcommunity must do more to provide security to theentire country  hold free and fair elections andaccelerate the speed of its reconstruction anddevelopment.Nepal supports United Nations efforts to bringpeace and normalcy to Haiti  Burundi  Liberia  Côted’Ivoire  the Democratic Republic of the Congo andthe Sudan. We are proud to be part of United Nationsefforts in our own humble way in those countries bydeploying our troops. The world community ought tosustain those efforts and help those countries in theirrebuilding and reconstruction endeavours.Nepal’s track record is a testimony to itsunflinching commitment to United Nationspeacekeeping operations. So far  over 45 000 Nepalesepeacekeepers have served in various missions in anoutstanding manner  and 47 of them have sacrificedtheir precious lives in the service of peace andhumanity. At the moment  nearly 2 500 Nepalese bluehelmets are deployed in 12 peacekeeping missionsaround the world.Nepal appreciates the United Nations help inbridging the equipment gaps for our deployment. Weurge the United Nations to enrich and widen the scopeof consultations with troop-contributing countries including in the areas of mission planning and pre-deployment preparations. We urge the United Nationsto give greater opportunities to Nepalese nationals inmanagement positions in the Secretariat and in fieldmissions.As we remain committed to peacekeeping andwilling to bring our experience to the table  Nepal hassought a non-permanent seat on the Security Councilfor the period 2007-2008  after a gap of 19 years. I takethis opportunity to appeal to Member States to give usthe privilege of their support in the election to be heldin 2006.It is our firm belief that the internationalcommunity must look beyond the immediate conflictsand seek to build a strong foundation for durable peaceby pursuing disarmament  development and the rule oflaw.Nepal is deeply concerned by the setback in thedisarmament realm. Of course  the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction is very important tokeeping such weapons from rogue elements. Nodurable peace will be possible without concertedefforts for disarmament  particularly of nuclearweapons  as they are the greatest threat to humancivilization. It is regrettable that the Conference onDisarmament has had no programme of work for thelast several years. That body must be allowed to workon a coherent strategy leading to the completeelimination of nuclear weapons in a time-boundmanner.We reiterate our support to nuclear-weapon-freezones and to keeping outer space free of such weapons.The international community should also work togetherto strengthen controls over small arms and lightweapons in order to prevent their abuse by non-Stateactors.Regional centres for peace and disarmament areinstrumental in building confidence among nations.Nepal is eager to relocate to Kathmandu the RegionalCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and thePacific at the earliest possible time. We are prepared tosign the necessary agreements  consistent with theprevailing diplomatic practices and provisions of theother two regional centres. We also want theKathmandu process revived without delay.International peace and security will continue toelude us until we address the root causes of conflicts:namely  poverty  ignorance  disease  exclusion andinjustice. Most of the conflicts around the world today which have regional and global consequences  arerooted in those sad human conditions. It is imperativethat we address those conditions collectively for theshared benefit of humankind as a whole.Today  more than a billion people live in absolutepoverty. Millions of people remain illiterate.Preventable diseases are taking a huge toll on children and HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis aredecimating entire societies  particularly in Africa.Growing populations have caused environmental10degradation. Racial  cultural and wealth-relateddivisions have often been sources of exclusion intolerance and injustice. Poverty has forced many tomigrate  and crimes have flourished in those sadconditions.There is no doubt that the developing countrieshave the primary responsibility for their own economicdevelopment and social progress. They need to takemeasures to reform their policies and institutions andcreate a climate in which enterprise  innovation anddevelopment can flourish. Most of those countries havebeen trying to do that on their own initiative and to liveup to their side of the pledges undertaken in variousglobal compacts.But their development partners also have theirobligations to meet under various global compacts because developing countries  given the mammothchallenges they face  cannot grapple with them andmeet the Millennium Development Goals withoutenhanced assistance from their development partners.The development partners should meet the agreedofficial development assistance targets and providegreater debt relief to indebted countries. Indeed although official development assistance flows haveincreased since 2002  they remain way below theadditional $50 billion per year that is required toachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Debtrepayment is eating up a large chunk of the resourcesof developing countries  and the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative has yet to cover allleast developed countries.In the long run  fair globalization on a levelplaying field and open markets will help reducepoverty  increase employment and lift the standard ofliving in developing nations. The developmentpartners  therefore  should dismantle their agriculturalsubsidies and open their markets to goods and labourfrom the South. They should also offer assistance tobuild capacities to attract and absorb foreign directinvestment and to remove supply-side constraints especially in least developed nations. The leastdeveloped countries — the most marginalized — needmore generous assistance and market access  as agreedto in the Brussels Programme of Action  to break thevicious circle of poverty and join the global economy.Our studies have shown that Nepal will not be able tomeet most Millennium Development Goals withoutsuch targeted measures from its development partners.Their geographical bottleneck and distance fromthe main corridors of commerce handicap landlockeddeveloping countries. We urge the transit anddevelopment partners to implement the AlmatyProgramme of Action and to overcome theirdifficulties.Though Nepal joined the World TradeOrganization (WTO) last year  most least developedcountries remain outside the multilateral tradeframework. We call on the members of the WTO tofacilitate quick and concessionary memberships forthose countries. Nepal also urges the internationalcommunity to change the international financialarchitecture so as to give a voice to the small andweak.Nepal believes that democracy  human rights andthe rule of law will have to go hand in hand with peaceand development to achieve overall progress in acountry. It is heartening that more people in the worldenjoy democracy and freedom today than ever before.Sadly  however  conflicts and poverty have drivenmillions of people from their homes and countries.Conflicts  together with criminal gangs  have alsoviolated the rule of law and peoples’ human rights.New democracies should learn from each other’sexperiences in consolidating democratic institutionsand values  and the world community should joinhands to fight transnational crime. The rule of lawshould apply not only in domestic situations but alsothroughout the international community.There are 17 million refugees around theworld — a staggering number. Many more millions ofpersons are internally displaced. In many areas  thosepeople live in fear and under appalling conditions.Children are deprived of a decent education  and adultslack jobs and economic opportunities. In some cases whole generations have grown up in refugee camps struggling to find their identity.The world community has an obligation toprovide humanitarian assistance to such needy peopleand to help them resettle once they have returnedhome.Nearly 100 000 Bhutanese refugees have beenliving in camps in eastern Nepal for over a decade. Ourbilateral efforts to find a negotiated settlement withBhutan have been slow and halting. Even the refugeeswho have been verified by a joint team have yet to goback home. Other refugees are waiting for jointverification.11For generations  Nepal and Bhutan have remainedclose friends and have respected each other. Thepresence of Bhutanese refugees on our soil is anavoidable irritant. Therefore  we earnestly hope thatthe process of verification can be expedited  thatverified refugees can be repatriated in a time-boundmanner  and that returnees will be able to enjoy theirhuman rights and to live in safety  dignity and honourin their own country.Obviously  Nepal does not have the capacity totake care of those refugees  though we have let themstay on humanitarian grounds. Hence  we call on theinternational community  including the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)  to continue its support until the refugees areable to go back home and fully resettle there.Our situation has become even more difficult dueto the armed violence launched in 1996 by the so-called Maoists. That violent movement began justwhen democracy was taking root and economic growthwas accelerating owing to policy reforms. The Maoistshave brutalized people and destroyed private homesand public infrastructure worth billions of rupees. Theyhave been abducting children and recruiting them aschild soldiers. They have continued to defy our call torespects schools as zones of peace. They are engagedin extortion and in the intimidation and killing ofinnocent civilians.This notwithstanding  His Majesty’s Governmenthas been sincerely seeking a results-oriented dialogueto find a political settlement. At the same time  theGovernment has an obligation to protect the lives ofpeople and to safeguard private property and publicinfrastructure by strengthening security. TheGovernment deeply appreciates the moral and materialsupport our friends have been providing us in the fightagainst the violence.In that context  we sincerely appreciate theinterest expressed by the Secretary-General in thesituation in Nepal  and his readiness to help theGovernment’s efforts towards peace. The four-partycoalition Government  with its broad mandate  isworking seriously to initiate the peace process inNepal. We are confident that we will be able to resolvethe problem by ourselves.Even in the midst of this difficulty  His Majesty’sGovernment is committed to protecting the freedomsand human rights of citizens. The National HumanRights Commission monitors the human rightssituation in the country  and a three-year NationalHuman Rights Action Plan has been launched toimplement our human rights commitments.We have been seeking technical assistance fromthe Office of the United Nations High Commissionerfor Human Rights as concerns the capacity-building ofthe National Human Rights Commission. The HumanRights Promotion Centre has been established toensure inter-departmental coordination and thesupervision of human rights issues.The United Nations is the pivot of multilateralismthat is imperative to address the complex challenges ofour time. Nepal supports the ongoing efforts for UnitedNations reform  including those aimed at revitalizingthe General Assembly and the Economic and SocialCouncil. Priority should be accorded to enhancing therole of the United Nations in the area of economic andsocial development. Security Council reform hasbecome an important issue for the internationalcommunity. Nepal has consistently supported theexpansion of the Council and reform of its methods ofwork  so as to make it more representative  transparentand democratic.In that context  the aspirations of some MemberStates — mainly India  Japan  Germany and Brazil —merit serious consideration for permanent membershipin the Security Council. At the same time  there isurgent need to expand the Council’s non-permanentmembership to ensure greater participation of smallMember States.Nepal hopes the High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change appointed by the Secretary-General will come up with recommendations that couldculminate in tangible reforms consistent with thepresent realities of the world. The high-level plenarymeeting of the General Assembly at the sixtiethanniversary of the United Nations will be a landmarkevent that should make a great leap forward on anumber of outstanding issues and expediteimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.This fall  Nepal is organizing the Second WorldBuddhist Summit in Lumbini  the birthplace of LordBuddha and a world heritage site in Nepal. We needsupport and participation from our friends the MemberStates to make the conference a success and to revivein New York the international committee for thedevelopment of Lumbini  which we are planning to dosoon.To conclude  the dawn of the new millenniumoffers us both opportunities for and challenges to12revitalizing the United Nations and strengtheningmultilateralism. As an active Member State  Nepal willdo its best to contribute to the efforts of the UnitedNations in order to attain the shared goals of peace andprosperity for all."

We assure you of Nauru’s fullestcooperation in the deliberations that are ahead of us.Through you  Mr. President  my delegation joinsprevious speakers in congratulating Foreign MinisterJulian Hunte of Saint Lucia for a productive fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly and for hisexemplary performance. As a member of the Allianceof Small Island States (AOSIS)  Nauru is extremelyproud to be associated with Saint Lucia and theCaribbean Community  and it just goes to show that  asis the case of our coconut trees  our potential is great.However  a lack of resources has limited the capacityto flourish of many more people like Julian Hunte fromthe AOSIS region who are serving or have served ininternational office.We congratulate the Secretary-General for hiscontinued commitment to multilateralism as a means ofresolving our common problems and for his report onthe work of the Organization (A/59/1) over the past 12months. However  it is discouraging to note thatpeacekeeping activities have had to increase rather thandecrease. Human rights and humanitarian normscontinue to be violated as a result of armed conflict andterrorism. Atrocious acts of terrorism against innocentcivilians  particularly women and children  continue totear the fabric of civility and the moral values on whicheach and every society on this planet is founded.Nauru sympathizes with those countries andpeoples who have suffered loss as a result of conflictand terrorist acts. Nauru encourages peace in its Asia-Pacific neighbourhood  and expresses the hope that whatever their differences  China and Taiwan canresolve them peacefully for the sake of the region’scontinued peace  stability and prosperity.We support the Secretary-General’s boldstatement of position with respect to the mitigation ofarmed conflicts generally  and those on the Africancontinent and in the Middle East in particular. We arepleased to hear that  for the remainder of his term in22office  he will be focusing mainly on strengthening therule of law and transitional justice. Nauru supports theposition the Secretary-General set out in his statementlast week at the 3rd meeting  when he said“It is by reintroducing the rule of law  andconfidence in its impartial application  that wecan hope to resuscitate societies shattered byconflict. It is the law  including Security Councilresolutions  which offers the best foundation forresolving prolonged conflicts — in the MiddleEast  in Iraq and around the world.”The democratization of governance  theapplication of accountability and transparency and theprotection of minorities and the vulnerable arecomplementary elements of ruling under law.Nauru  like other Member States  looks forwardwith anticipation to the report of the Secretary-Generalon the findings of the High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change to be finalized later this year.The Panel has been charged with the task of reviewingthreats to peace and security  as well as other globalchallenges  insofar as they may influence or connectwith those threats. Nauru continues to believe thatmultilateralism is the key to resolving contemporaryproblems in all of their complexity. Hence  it isimportant that the recommendations of the High-levelPanel reinforce that point and that the proposals aredoable and add value to the reform programmes thatare already in the pipeline  including the revitalizationof the General Assembly.My delegation has stated in previous debates thatit agrees fully with the reform of the Security Council.The fresh approach initiated by the President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session has  tosome extent  injected life back into the debate byfocusing on key elements of the reform. It is our hopethat the Bureau will continue the push for the furtherconvergence of views by refining the choices that wemade during the fifty-eighth session. The formation ofan informal group of countries with aspirations topermanent seats in an expanded Security Council isinteresting  and could prove to be a catalyst  expeditingthe debate on expansion. Nauru can and will supportthe aspirations of Germany  Japan and India to apermanent seat in an expanded Security Council.It is my delegation’s firm view  however  thatprogress is being held hostage by those countries thatinsist that the expansion should not be done withouteither eliminating or modifying the veto poweraccorded to permanent members of the SecurityCouncil. Unless this difference in approach isreconciled  time and energy spent on other elements ofthe reform will be futile.The revitalization of the General Assembly musthave at its heart the maximization of opportunity forequitable representation by all Member States in themajor organs of the United Nations and its committeesand to ensure that their programme of work allows forthe full participation of members  particularly the smallStates. In that regard  the proposal to split the work ofthe Main Committees of the General Assembly intotwo segments over a six-month period would allowsmall States like Nauru  which has only two diplomaticstaff  to increase its participation. Nauru wouldtherefore support such a proposal when furtherdeliberations take place later in the session.Nauru would note that its position is consistentwith the United Nations core principle of universality which calls on us all to be ever-mindful of the views ofthose countries seeking expanded responsibilities ininternational affairs. Countries that have sterlingrecords in democracy  human rights  peace and theprinciple of freedom should have their achievements as well as their capacities  appropriately recognized.As a small island developing State in the PacificOcean  Nauru aligns itself with the interventionsalready made by the leaders of countries of theAlliance of Small Island States who have spokenbefore me on the concerns and challenges that we  thesmall-island big-ocean developing States  are facing.Nauru bears all the unique characteristics of a smallisland State: smallness in both land area andpopulation  lack of resources  remoteness andvulnerability to exogenous forces  whether man-madeor natural.The devastation of Niue by Cyclone Heta and thedisastrous hurricane destruction in Caribbean countriesthis year are stark reminders of the vulnerability ofisland States. Nauru joins others in expressing itsdeepest sympathy for the loss of life and property inthe affected countries of the Caribbean and thesouthern coastal states of the United States of America.Against that background  my delegation wouldlike to focus on what it considers to be a spanner in thewheel of negotiations on an outcome strategy paper forthe International Meeting to Review the23Implementation of the Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  to be held in Mauritius. It appears to us that theprogramme for political recognition of the special caseof small island developing States (SIDS)  as outlined atthe Barbados Conference in 1994  and reinforced inNew York during the five-year review held in 1999  aswell as in chapter VII of the Johannesburg Plan ofImplementation  has taken a backseat in thenegotiations to generic undertakings made at otherinternational conferences on development since1999 — in particular  the Millennium DevelopmentGoals of 2000 and the Monterrey Consensus of 2002.Benchmarking the SIDS outcome strategy paper to thelatter agreed texts would be hypocrisy of a high orderinsofar as political acceptance of SIDS as a specialcase is concerned. Indeed  the slow progress in theimplementation by many small island developingStates of the measures called for in those texts is but atrue reflection that our problems are SIDS-specific andgo deeper than the generic issues of development.Nauru is also concerned that some of thedevelopment partners would skew the review into oneaddressing SIDS-Millennium Development Goalperformance instead of SIDS performance on theBarbados Programme of Action. I believe that ourconcern has to an extent been warranted and thereforemy delegation would like to use this opportunity toremind our partners that the review is about identifyingand solving the failure of small island developingStates to accomplish agreed development programmesunder the Barbados Plan of 1994; and it’s about howyou  our development partners  can help SIDS to attainthose goals. It is therefore our sincere hope that thethird and critical round of negotiations scheduled inearly October will be conducted in the right spirit andwith better understanding.The Pacific Islands Forum continues to be thevehicle for regional cooperation and collaborationamong the 16 Pacific Island countries of the Centraland Western Pacific. It approved the terms of referencefor the Pacific plan at the Apia Forum last month torevitalize the Forum and to make it more effective inits response to the needs of the peoples of the region.Issues such as climate change  peace and security  theeconomic and social development of our peoples andthe protection and sustainable use of the environmentand our natural resources are still the priorities of theForum.Nauru welcomes the admission of the Kingdomof Thailand as the thirteenth member of the Forum’sdialogue partners. That group of countries  along withthe European Union  individual member countries ofthe EU and the United Nations specialized agenciesand programmes  are critical to the development of theregion as they provide the necessary financial backing.During the session  cooperation between the UnitedNations and the Pacific Islands Forum will beconsidered under item 56 (q) of the GeneralAssembly’s agenda. The Pacific Island Forum group atthe United Nations looks forward to working closelywith Member States to develop and expand the areas ofits cooperation with them  pursuant to a draftresolution that will be presented to the Assembly indue course.Nauru  like the other low-lying small islandStates  sees the Kyoto Protocol as its means ofsalvation from the sea-level rise and climate changethat threaten to devastate its already fragile ecosystem so essential to the livelihood and culture of its people.My delegation understands that the Russian Federationstands between the Kyoto Protocol’s coming into forceand its continuing to linger in the wilderness. Nauruwelcomes the statement by the Foreign Minister of theRussian Federation that President Putin has orderedserious consideration of Russia’s ratification of theProtocol. That is a step forward from last year.A healthy Pacific Ocean and the sustainable useof its natural resources  including the highly migratoryfish stocks  are also critical to our livelihood. We in thePacific have “walked the walk” on those issues by thedevelopment of an ocean policy to guide us in themanagement of our part of the Pacific Ocean and toform the framework for future regional ocean-relatedinitiatives. The Convention on the Conservation andManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in theWestern and Central Pacific Ocean  which provides acomprehensive regime for the management of theregion’s highly migratory fish stock both in ourexclusive economic zone and on the high seas  hascome into force. In addition  the trans-shipment ofnuclear waste through our waters is of great concern tomany of the island countries because of the damage itcould cause.One of the positive outcomes of the PacificIslands Forum meeting last month was the decision ofthe Forum leaders to intervene in the internal economiccrisis in Nauru at the request of our Government and24consistent with the terms of reference of the Forum’sBiketawa Declaration of 2000. Our crisis lies largely inthe fact that two thirds of our workforce are in theemploy of the Government and its agencies. Thoseemployees have not been paid a regular salary for overa year now. At irregular intervals either A$ 100 in foodvouchers or A$ 30 to A$ 50 in cash to purchase foodhas been paid out  compared with the basic wage ofA$ 350 — or about US$ 250 — per fortnight. Theaverage family size on Nauru is around six people. A$50 cash fortnightly is equivalent to US$ 0.42 perfamily member per day and is well below the UnitedNations-defined abject poverty level of US$ 1 a day.The fact that many Nauruans can harvest foodfrom the sea and the land  however limited  coupledwith our culture and tradition of sharing  has meantthat despite the lack of cash our people eat at least oncea day. The real problem concerns the level of dailynutritional intake  particularly for children  as onecannot buy imported commodities such as fruits andvegetables and hygienic supplies. The situation isexacerbated by the fact that Nauru imports 90 per centof all food and other essential items. Accordingly  foodsecurity in the medium to long term is a seriousconcern as there is no form of agricultural activity onNauru.Nauru’s recovery cannot be possible without theestablishment of reputable financial institutions onNauru and the lifting of the restrictions on financialtransactions between the international community andNauru. That will not happen if Nauru continues to besubjected to countermeasures and blacklisting by theFinancial Action Task Force (FATF). Despite theoutlawing of the registration of foreign banks some 12months ago  Nauru has not been successful in itsappeal no longer to be the subject of countermeasuresas a first step  although there has been incrementalprogress towards that goal over the same period.Following the visit by the International Monetary Fundearly this year  Nauru has  for the fourth time  passedan anti-money-laundering law that now supersedesprevious laws. We have participated in FATF regionalreviews but  despite strong support provided by actionstaken on advice  we seem to have failed at the plenaryreview.As I speak  the Parliament of Nauru isconsidering the passage of three bills addressing issuesraised by the FATF: the counter-terrorism andtransnational organized crime bill  the proceeds ofcrime bill and the mutual assistance in criminal mattersbill. We are confident that the passage of those bills the prioritizing of related issues through theappointment of an anti-money-laundering nationalcoordinating committee — which also comprises theAustralian official appointed as secretary forfinance — and the coordinating committee’s face-to-face meeting with FATF’s Asia-Pacific Working Groupin Brunei next week will bring us closer to ourobjective of being de-listed. We will persevere  as weknow that  in the end  we will prevail.The intervention by the Pacific Islands Forum isseen as pre-empting the possibility of the economiccrisis escalating into a security and safety issue for theNauruan people and for the region. Teams of regionalexperts representing the Forum and Australia havevisited Nauru on a fact-finding mission  and we will bereporting to the leaders in due course  which willinclude recommendations on the type of assistance andthe manner in which it should be rendered. While theproposal  which is to be formally known as PacificRegional Assistance to Nauru  is being finalized  theForum has agreed to provide  in the immediate future capacity-building assistance in the justice  judicial financial audit and national planning sectors  as well astransportation for the health and education sectors anda small cash grant to assist with public-sector wages.That assistance is complementing the aidprovided separately by Australia  which has deployedAustralian finance and treasury officials to head theNauru Department of Finance  and the deployment next month  of Australian police to take command ofthe Nauru Police Force. Indeed  as I speak  theParliament of Nauru is also considering a reformbudget designed with the assistance of Australianfinance and treasury officials. That budget includesharsh but realistic measures as a preliminary butdecisive step towards stabilizing  and eventuallyrebuilding  the economy and society of Nauru.For the same reasons  the Government of Nauruwrote to the Secretary-General in August of this year toalert him of the looming crisis in Nauru and to requestassistance from the United Nations system to help toalleviate the plight of the Nauruan people. PresidentLudwig Scotty and Foreign Minister David Adeangmay be visiting New York in the latter part of Octoberto meet with the Secretary-General and relevant UnitedNations bodies on this matter. My Government looksforward to receiving a positive response from the25United Nations system  in the same manner as it didfrom the Pacific Islands Forum.In conclusion  the fifty-ninth session has criticalwork ahead of it  such as the International Meeting forthe 10-year Review of the Barbados Programme ofAction  the introduction and deliberation on thefindings of the High-Level Panel constituted by theSecretary-General  the review of the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  thepreparations for the 5-year review of the MillenniumDeclaration and its Goals and the continuation of ourdeliberations on the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly and of the reform of the Security Council  toname but a few items.As the Secretary-General has stated  the UnitedNations is at a fork in the road in terms of its relevanceas an organization of nations seeking commonsolutions to common problems. The next 12 monthswill determine whether we  the united nations of theworld  continue on the road where “business as usual”is the mode of operation or whether we follow the roadof multilateralism as the principal rule of ourengagement. The statements thus far indicate the latter but we have heard that before."
"132",5360,"NZL",59,2004,"Fifty-nine years ago theUnited Nations was established by nations determinedto work collectively to find alternatives to conflict as ameans of resolving disputes and to create a stable secure and more just and prosperous world. Devastatedand exhausted by world war for the second time within25 years  nations put their faith in multilateralism andin this body in order to avoid future wars. The name'United Nations' evoked the unity of humankind  inwhich our shared needs and common humanity weremore important than our differences.It is obvious as we consider the world today thatwe have achieved that vision only in part. Yes  worldwars have been avoided. International covenants haveset out universally agreed human rights standardsagainst which the performance of governments can bemeasured. International law has been developed andstrengthened. As Kofi Annan emphasized this morning(see )  putting the rule of law into effect athome and internationally is essential to achieving afair  just and civilized world. Cooperation has achievedadvances in meeting social  economic andenvironmental needs.But much more remains to be done. War  moreoften within than across the boundaries of States  hastaken the lives of tens of millions of people since 1945 most of them civilians. Weapons of mass destructionhave accumulated and access to them has spread tomore countries. New diseases such as HIV/AIDS haveemerged  with devastating consequences. The gapbetween rich and poor countries has widened  notdiminished.This year the Secretary-General's High-LevelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change will putforward proposals for reforming and strengthening theUnited Nations  aimed at ensuring its relevance andeffectiveness in addressing these issues. It is criticalthat we seize this unique opportunity to institutepositive reforms and not squander it by adoptingnarrow  self-interested and inflexible responses. Norwill a lowest-common-denominator approach achievewhat we all require.Reform is long overdue. The composition of theSecurity Council cannot go on reflecting the world as itwas in 1945. An expanded Security Council and reformof outmoded electoral groupings is necessary for theCouncil to be representative of the internationalcommunity as it is today. Those changes willstrengthen the Councilís mandate and enhance itscredibility as the pre-eminent organ of the UnitedNations. No solution  of course  will satisfy theviewpoint of every Member nation. A willingness tocompromise on a package of proposals will beessential. But clearly  enhancing the representation ofareas such as Asia  Latin America and Africa must bean objective  and account must be taken of thesignificant contributions to the United Nations ofnations such as Japan.While the High-Level Panel will focus on reformof the United Nations and security considerations development goals to create a fairer world and promoteeconomic and social progress in the developing worldare further vital considerations for the United Nationsin the year ahead. For hundreds of millions of people starvation  disease and poverty are more immediatethreats than the concerns others of us have aboutterrorism and security.We are now at a turning point in achieving theMillennium Development Goals. Improving the qualityand quantity of development assistance is crucial.However  real and lasting progress to meetdevelopment challenges is also dependent on buildinga fairer  more open and equitable global tradingsystem. Countries of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) spend$360 billion each year on subsidizing agricultural47production in a way that excludes opportunities for thedeveloping world to export - not only to OECDcountries  but to third markets as well. That sumdwarfs the amount the OECD countries provide indevelopment assistance.New Zealand welcomes the progress made at theWorld Trade Organization General Council meeting inGeneva in July  which put the Doha DevelopmentAgenda back on track. Agriculture is at the heart of theround; the European Union and United Statesagreement to eliminate all agricultural export subsidiesis particularly welcome.The United Nations must also adapt itself to thechanging nature of security and humanitarian concerns.The concept of national sovereignty being paramountand standing in the way of international intervention inlocal conflicts cannot be sustained. As the Secretary-General has challenged us 'if humanitarian intervention is  indeed  anunacceptable assault on sovereignty  how shouldwe respond to a Rwanda  to a Srebrenica - togross and systematic violations of human rightsthat offend every precept of our commonhumanity?' (A/54/2000  para. 217)The International Commission on Interventionand State Sovereignty concluded two and a half yearsago that sovereign States have the responsibility toprotect their own citizens from avoidable catastrophe:from mass murder and rape  from starvation. Whenthey are unwilling or unable to do so  thatresponsibility must be borne by the broader communityof nations.We are today witnessing a humanitarian andhuman rights catastrophe in Darfur. The World HealthOrganization reports that up to 10 000 people a monthare dying or being killed. The very young and theelderly are most vulnerable.A few days ago  by its resolution 1564 (2004)  theSecurity Council resolved to support an enlargedAfrican Union monitoring mission  demanded that allparties cease all violence and human rights violationsand threatened further steps against the Government ofthe Sudan if it fails to disarm the militias and protectcivilians.Within the General Assembly  countries mustwork together in a united and determined way toenforce those provisions and prevent the tragedy that isunfolding. History will not forgive those who stand inthe way of protecting 1.5 million refugees in thatregion and allowing them to return safely to theirhomes. It is also important that those responsible forthe mass murders and the abuse of human rights therebe held to account for their actions. There must be noimpunity for such crimes.That is true in Darfur  and is also true of thoseresponsible for the destruction of East Timor and themurder of people there in 1999. The ad hoc tribunals inIndonesia have failed to bring to justice those who areresponsible. That failure can only encourage suchpeople to commit further atrocities  believing that theywill never be held responsible for their actions.New Zealand welcomes the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court and the role that it willnow play in dealing with genocide  war crimes andcrimes against humanity. It urges all countries whichhave not yet done so to accede to the conventionestablishing that body and to recognize its jurisdiction.In the area of conflict resolution  we face todaytwo major challenges: in Afghanistan and in Iraq. NewZealand has strongly supported efforts to bring securityand stability to Afghanistan. As a small country wehave contributed more than NZ$80 million in militaryand development assistance. We welcome progresstowards presidential elections next month and theessential democratic mandate that they will provide tothe Government.Strong international support  however  will benecessary to meet the challenges which lie ahead. Thatincludes ending the production and trading of drugs.Afghanistan provides about 75 per cent of the worldtrade in opiates. The money derived funds warlordsand organized crime and undermines the ability of thelegitimate Government to function.New Zealand deplores the violence in Iraq  whichcontinues to harm or take the lives of so many people and the circumstances which have contributed to thatviolence. We call on those responsible for taking thelives of innocent people to end their violence. Theynow have access to a political process which theyshould use to promote their views and interests. Acredible election process is vital to creating an IraqiGovernment which has a popular mandate. The UnitedNations has a key role to play in that process  butadequate security and a safe environment are firstnecessary for that to occur. New Zealand will continue48to support the interim Iraqi authority and the UnitedNations in their efforts to restore security  peace andprosperity to the Iraqi people  who have suffered for solong.In Iraq and elsewhere  close attention also needsto be given to the protection of United Nations staff.The General Assembly this year will consider anintegrated security strategy for the United Nations which will incorporate a system-wide review of theUnited Nations security apparatus  accountability andresources. The Convention on the Safety of UnitedNations and Associated Personnel must bestrengthened and supported by all States Members ofthe United Nations.New Zealand condemns all acts of terrorism andwill continue to contribute strongly to the campaignagainst terrorism. In particular  we condemn theinhumanity of terrorists in Beslan who sacrificedchildren as pawns in pursuit of their politicalobjectives. However  attempts to suppress terrorism byforce will not by themselves be enough unless we alsoaddress the causes which drive people to support finance or be recruited into terrorism.In that regard  no action will be more importantto the undermining of terrorism today than finding ajust and sustainable solution to the conflict betweenIsrael and the Palestinian people. The internationalcommunity must work with those countries toovercome the failure of leadership  the lack of resolveand the cycle of violence and retaliation which stand inthe way of solving that conflict.Finally  in the Pacific region  New Zealand's ownneighbourhood  we can celebrate the progress whichhas been made in Bougainville and in the SolomonIslands in ending conflict and re-establishing the ruleof law. In both cases  a concerted regional responsewith the support of the United Nations has beeneffective. In Bougainville  that response created peacefrom a situation where a 10-year civil war had resultedin widespread devastation and the loss of thousands oflives.In the Solomon Islands  the intervention of theRegional Assistance Mission has restored the rule oflaw by its elected Government in place of the anarchycreated by armed militias. More than 3 500 weaponshave been collected and destroyed  social services anda credible budgetary progress restored and militiamenand corrupt elements from the police and Governmentarrested and charged.Much however  remains to be done to meet thewide-ranging challenges which confront the Pacificregion  including environmental threats  ethnicconflict  poor law enforcement and governance and thethreat of disease. Regional solutions are being appliedby the Pacific Islands Forum through greatercollaboration and integration in addressing problems.International cooperation through processes such as the10-year Review of the Barbados Programme of Actionset to take place in Mauritius next year will also help.In conclusion  59 years from the end of theSecond World War and the establishment of the UnitedNations  the world continues to face major challengesto its security and well-being. The opportunity existsthis year for us to consider and improve the ways bywhich the Assembly can address the problems faced byhumanity and make a difference. Success or failure todo so will be the collective responsibility of all of us."
"133",5405,"OMN",59,2004,"Onbehalf of the Government of the Sultanate of Oman  Iam pleased to congratulate you  Sir  on your election asPresident of this session. We assure you that we willsincerely cooperate with you in order to contribute tothe success of this session and to the realization of thedesirable objectives to which we all aspire. We all hopeto serve humankind and the cause of internationalpeace and security.I also take this opportunity  Sir  to express myheartfelt thanks to his Excellency Mr. Julian RobertHunte  your predecessor and President of the Assemblyat its fifty-eighth session  for all his efforts to ensurethe success of that session and of the concurrentresumptions of the tenth emergency special session.This session of the General Assembly has beenconvened under very complex and difficultcircumstances. There has been a clear decline in theinternational community’s ability to unite and to reachconsensus on solutions to the diverse problems thathave undermined international diplomacy. Thoseproblems have deprived preventive diplomacy of itsability to create an environment of internationalunderstanding conducive to agreement on issues ofcommon interest to all peoples.We believe that there is an urgent need for theinternational community to review both regional andinternational policies and to put an end to the sense ofuncertainty  pessimism and vagueness surrounding thework of the United Nations. States that can influenceinternational policy have a moral and materialresponsibility to take the initiative to review thosepolicies and create an environment of cooperationamong international stakeholders.The region of the Middle East is the focus ofglobal attention  because of its potential impact oninternational stability. We share the interest shown bymany countries in the situation in the Middle East which is prompted by the need to find solutions to thepolitical and social problems facing the region.Here  it is worth noting that the Group of Eight at its meeting on Sea Island in the state of Georgia inthe United States on 9 June 2004  focused their intereston the Middle East. In principle  we welcome theirposition since we believe that closer cooperation isessential within the Group of Eight and the countries ofthe Middle East to consider how to prioritize thediscussion of the political issues that remain the mainobstacle to the march of the people of the Middle Easttowards progress and stability.The problem of Palestine and Israel’s continuedoccupation of Arab territories in Syria and Lebanoncannot be put on the back burner indefinitely.Therefore  we should seek fair and just solutions tothose problems. The road map announced on 30 April2003 was welcomed by the Arab countries but has yetto be implemented. We therefore call on the UnitedStates of America  the Russian Federation  theEuropean Union and the United Nations — themembers of the Quartet that sponsored the road map —to fulfil their commitment to the Middle East.The Security Council adopted resolution 1546(2004)  by which it transferred sovereignty in Iraq fromthe Coalition forces to an interim Iraqi Government. Itwas a milestone in the development of the situation inIraq. However  the deteriorating security situation inIraq remains a cause of deep concern. We believe thatthe interim Iraqi Government is making great efforts torestore normalcy and stability. We support theGovernment of Iraq in its endeavours to unify all Iraqisaround a common agenda. We feel that certainsuccesses have been achieved through the adoption ofpolitical dialogue  and that it is essential to Iraq toexpand that dialogue.In the Sudan  the Government has been makingcommendable efforts to achieve stability in Darfur. Welook forward to ongoing cooperation between theAfrican Union and the Sudanese Government. TheGovernment’s willingness to implement certainmeasures proposed by the United Nations and tocooperate with the Security Council to implementresolution 1564 (2004) deserves our support andcommendation.In our view  the United Nations should providefinancial and technical support to the efforts of theAfrican Union and the Sudanese Government toachieve peace in Darfur. Moreover  we believe that anyaction by the Security Council against the Sudan wouldbe harmful and would undermine the United Nationsability to work effectively on the ground. It would moreover  hamper the efforts of the Sudan and theAfrican Union to achieve peace.All human beings share this Earth and shouldwork together to develop and preserve its resources. Itis highly important that the international communitytake note of the environmental changes taking place22everywhere  such as the destructive storms  floods andfires that have had tremendously harmful effects on allhumanity. Those phenomena may be caused by humantransgression and destruction of environmentaldiversity. That is why the international community iscalled upon to study the environment and do whateverit can to stem the phenomenon of desertification anddrought in order to preserve great global sources offood.Recent international policies have resulted in theemergence of serious types of terrorist acts. One of themost horrific of such acts was the hostage-taking in aschool in Beslan in North Ossetia in the RussianFederation. We strongly condemn that terrorist act andexpress our solidarity with the Russian Government infighting such attacks. We believe that the internationalcommunity should show solidarity in the face ofterrorism everywhere and engage in in-depthconsideration of the phenomenon. The convening of aninternational conference to consider terrorism is a goodidea  since the outcome of such a conference could bean important tool that would help defeat thephenomenon.The Sultanate of Oman believes that States’accession and commitment to disarmament treaties andconventions would enhance and maintain internationalpeace and security. In that context  we should seriouslyconsider the possibility of establishing collectivemechanisms for arms monitoring and control  based onunified standards acceptable to all  be it in the field ofweapons of mass destruction or that of conventionalweapons. Otherwise  the role of the world order willremain limited to theoretical studies or to drawingattention to the dangers of the arms race todevelopment  the environment and international peaceand security.The world stockpile of weapons of massdestruction  in particular nuclear weapons  coulddestroy human life on our planet many times over. Thatis why the Sultanate of Oman has signed mostconventions on disarmament and arms control including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons  the Chemical Weapons Conventionand the Biological Weapons Convention.The emergence of globalization and the WorldTrade Organization raised the hopes and aspirations ofpeoples for an era of international cooperation thatwould broaden sustainable development. However  theresults of the new developments have been anamalgamation of democracy and dictatorship  ofhuman rights and enslavement  of great prosperity andextreme poverty  of the provision of advanced healthcare side by side with fatal contagious diseases  of freetrade and world trade monopoly  and of a rise in theprice of industrial products and a decline in the pricesof the raw materials required to maintain theirproduction. The amalgam has led to economicimbalances. Is that what we sought to achieve?The High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges andChange was established in the context of an initiativeby the Secretary-General to seek ways of reforming theOrganization  and in particular of expanding thepermanent membership of the Security Council. Wewould welcome such an expansion in order to broadenthe base of participation in the Council’s decision-making process. However  the permanent membersshould work to create an international climateconducive to an expansion that reflects theinternational will. Conditions of membership should bereviewed to include aspects that conform tointernational changes so as to guarantee equitablerepresentation and international consensus if possible.We believe that it is high time for permanentmembers of the Security Council to review their ownattitudes and policies in the Council in order tofacilitate the required restructuring. We believe that theexcessive adoption of Security Council resolutions onsecondary international issues undermines the prestigeof the Council and reduces the ability of the UnitedNations to deal with priority questions that areimportant to international peace and security. Webelieve that the Security Council must not interfere inthe internal affairs of Member States  so as to preservethe international consensus in addressing issues relatedto international peace and security.The Sultanate of Oman would like to express itssupport to the efforts made by the United Nations. Wewould particularly like to express our support to theSecretary-General and to the role he plays inconducting the affairs of this Organization. Ourdelegation will spare no effort to ensure the success ofthis session  in order to realize the objectives to whichwe all aspire."
"134",5451,"PAK",59,2004,"Allow me at the outset toexpress to you  Sir  our warm felicitations on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-ninth session. We congratulate Mr. Julian Hunteon his successful stewardship of the fifty-eighthsession of the Assembly. I also reaffirm our deepappreciation for the wise leadership of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and his services for the causeof peace and progress in the world.A profound transformation is under way ininternational relations. The dangerous balances of thecold war have been replaced by the complex andequally dangerous realities of our world today. It is aworld marked by intensifying globalization ofeconomies  production  trade and information  on oneside; and by terrorist violence  poverty and disease  onthe other.The growing asymmetries in power among States discrimination in the dispensing of internationaljustice  repression of peoplesí legitimate aspirationsand growing socio-economic disparities haveprecipitated new threats to international peace and tointernational security: the threats of terrorism proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  andimploding States. The world today sees turmoil andupheaval everywhere  especially in the third world  andmore specifically in the Muslim world. Too manyfronts have been opened and too many battle lines havebeen drawn. The time for closing fronts has come. Theworld today is crying for peace  reconciliation andreform. Our objective today has to be harmony throughreconciliation and accommodation  globally andregionally.Terrorism poses the most urgent threat to manycountries  including the most powerful States. Formany of us  the terrorist threat is very close and may bevery personal. Terrorism threatens Pakistan's vitalnational interests and objectives. We have thusparticipated actively in the unprecedented globalcampaign against it. Pakistan has led the way in thatcampaign. Our counter-terrorist campaign is ongoing.Global cooperation against terrorism has beenhighly successful. Determined and collective action hascontained and disrupted the violent agendas of theterrorists. We are winning the battle against terrorists.However  what we are doing is insufficient to win theultimate war against them. The immediate anti-terroristresponse has to be accompanied by a clear long-termstrategy that strikes at the root of the problem if we areto ensure final success against this scourge.I have proposed a two-pronged strategy ofenlightened moderation to overcome terrorism andprevent a clash of civilizations. The most recentIslamic Summit  in Malaysia  endorsed that plan which involves  on the one hand  internal socio-economic reform in the Muslim world and  on theother  active support from the major Powers to ensurepolitical justice and socio-economic revival for allIslamic peoples. While the Islamic world has taken itsfirst step in the form of nominating a Commission ofEminent Persons to propose measures for a renaissancein the Muslim world  the major Powers of the Westhave yet to show movement in seriously trying toresolve internationally recognized disputes affectingthe Muslim world.The industrialized world must support theendeavour to bring about an Islamic renaissance especially through adequate financial and technicalassistance and larger trade opportunities. Moreimportant  justice must be offered to Islamic peoples inthe form of the resolution of all outstandinginternational disputes which affect Muslims. There isno time to lose. Action has to be taken before an iron21curtain finally descends between the West and theIslamic world.The tragedy of Palestine is an open woundinflicted on the psyche of every Muslim. It generatesanger and resentment across the Islamic world.Continued Israeli violence and the Israelis' erection ofthe illegal separation wall  usurping more Palestinianland  as well as suicide attacks by misguidedPalestinians  are frustrating the prospects of peace andprolonging the agony of the Palestinian people. WhilePakistan stands for peace  recognizing the right ofIsrael to exist as also the right of the Palestinians tohave their own homeland  we can never accept theusurpation of additional Palestinian land. Israel has noright to erect its separation wall beyond its 1967boundaries. Pakistan calls on Israel to withdraw thewall from all occupied Palestinian lands  taking it backto the pre-1967 boundaries. We also call on Israel tostop the daily atrocities against Palestinians. Pakistanalso appeals to President Yasser Arafat to use hisinfluence to reciprocally halt the intifada and givepeace a chance.A major responsibility rests with the Quartet  andin particular with the world's greatest Power  theUnited States  to secure a fair and peaceful solution tothe problem  realizing the vision of two States  Israeland Palestine  living side by side in peace  harmonyand security. The United States can and must play therole of a just broker of peace. Peace must succeed inthe Middle East; failure is no longer an option.It has always been my conviction that Pakistanand India can resolve all their differences  includingover Jammu and Kashmir  through a sincere dialogue.The dangerous confrontation of 2002 and the threewars prior to that between our two countries havedemonstrated that there is no military solution to ourproblems. The aspiration to peace enjoys popularsupport in Pakistan and  I believe  in India as well.Neither country can achieve its ambition for social andeconomic progress in the absence of peace. We mustachieve peace for the sake of the impoverished peopleof South Asia ó for their development and prosperity.After several aborted attempts  Pakistan and Indiahave been able to initiate confidence-buildingmeasures and a composite dialogue this year to addressall outstanding issues. Pakistan has pursued thisprocess with complete sincerity  giving bilateralism afinal chance. We feel that the dual channels ofconfidence-building measures and the dialogue processmust proceed in tandem. We also are firmly committedto resolving all disputes with India peacefully including the Kashmir dispute. That issue cannot beignored. Its resolution cannot be delayed inordinately.We desire a resolution for Kashmir which is just andacceptable to India  Pakistan and the people ofKashmir.We also seek strategic stability with India. I amglad to say that up until now  the normalization processhas progressed well  in a cordial atmosphere. Now thatthe negotiations are entering the difficult stage ofgrappling with solutions to previously irreconcilabledisputes  Pakistan hopes that India will show the samesincerity  flexibility and boldness that Pakistan willdemonstrate. I look forward to my meeting the dayafter tomorrow with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.I would like to convey to him that this is the momentfor peace; we must not allow it to slip away.Iraq has taken a serious turn  to the anguish of theentire world community. It is imperative that togetherwith closing the Palestine and Kashmir fronts  we alsowind down the Iraq confrontation. Pakistan stands forrestoration of peace and stability in Iraq to ensure itsunity and territorial integrity. That can only beachieved through handing over governance authority tothe people of Iraq and allowing them full control overtheir natural resources. Internal law and order andsecurity can be best promoted by local Iraqi police andmilitia  who need to be built up expeditiously.At an opportune time  and at the request of thepeople and Government of Iraq  the Muslim worldcould play a role in bringing peace and harmony to thisconflict-torn nation.The forthcoming elections in Afghanistan will bean important landmark in the countryís progresstowards democracy and stability. Pakistan will do all itcan to prevent terrorists from using our territory todisrupt the Afghan election process. The subsequentparliamentary elections in April 2005 would also augurwell for self-governance in Afghanistan. While thepolitical channel is progressing well ó and we wishPresident Karzai all success ó the process of buildingthe Afghan National Army and reconstruction effortsneed to be accelerated in order to install durable peacein Afghanistan.In our globalized world  peace and developmentare interdependent  now more than ever before. Despite22dynamic growth in some parts of the developing world economic and social disparities are increasing. The richare richer; the poor are poorer. Over 2 billion people onour planet ó a quarter of the worldís population ólive in abject poverty  afflicted by hunger  disease andconflict. Islands of peace and prosperity cannot coexistfor long within oceans of instability and poverty.A bold and innovative global strategy is requiredto redress the growing inequalities in the world. Goodgovernance is a precondition for development; but theneed to rectify the glaring inequities and imbalances inthe international financial and trade systems is equallyessential.Official development assistance can and must bedoubled. Innovative ways can and must be adopted togenerate the financial resources required fordevelopment. The billions transferred abroad bycorrupt leaders should be returned to the lootedcountries to finance poverty alleviation  education andhealth. International investment flows should beconsciously directed to the poorer developingcountries  where such funds could unleash the latentpower of the poor for consumption and production.We also know by now that trade  and not just aid is the way to promote growth and to benefit fromglobalization. However  it has to be made moreequitable. Unfair agricultural subsidies should beeliminated and high and escalating tariffs thatdiscriminate against the products of the poor should beremoved. Special and differential treatment should beoffered to disadvantaged developing countries. In myview  we need more than a level playing field; we needa field tilted in favour of the developing countries.Unless the worldís leaders generate the politicalwill required to agree and implement those measuresurgently  the Millennium Development Goals willremain a mirage.In Pakistan  we are well on the way totransforming our country into a modern  progressive tolerant  democratic  Islamic state  reflecting the visionof our founding father  Quaid-e-Azam. Democracy hasbeen restored in Pakistan. The people have beenempowered through a revolutionary local governmentsystem. Our women have been empowered. However like other developing countries  Pakistan confrontsseveral challenges. But  we are confident of success.Our governance is good. Our national priorities areabsolutely clear.Today  there is welcome resurgence of support formultilateralism. This must be a multilateralism basedon the principles of the United Nations Charter  acooperative and democratic multilateralism. It mustseek just  peaceful and durable solutions to conflictsand disputes. It must promote a programme for nucleardisarmament and non-proliferation. It must fosterglobal development and global prosperity.All our collective aspirations can best be pursuedwithin this world Organization. The United Nationsmust be strengthened and revitalized to respond to thechallenges of twenty-first century.The United Nations Security Council shouldbecome more effective  democratic and representative.There is no agreement on the aspiration of a few Statesto acquire permanent membership in the SecurityCouncil. The overwhelming majority of States areagainst the creation of new centres of privilege. TheCouncil should be enlarged to ensure the representationof the mostly small and medium States which havejoined the United Nations over the last three decades.We have to consider new ideas to craft a consensus onthe enlargement of the Security Council.Pakistan believes that a new consensus on peace security and development  can and should be achievedon the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of theUnited Nations next year. The summit meetingsuggested by the Secretary-General for next year mustlead to a negotiated final document adopted throughconsensus. That historic summit will  I hope  andPakistan hopes  create a new paradigm to achieveuniversal peace and prosperity."
"135",5494,"PAN",59,2004,"I wish tobegin by warmly congratulating Mr. Jean Ping Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon  on his electionto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I wish also to extend my country’sthanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  forthe powerful and inspiring words he spoke yesterday(see ).Thousands of my compatriots are today sufferingunder the blows of nature. Floods of a kind neverbefore seen have brought grief to many families. Theentire country has turned to the victims in a trulymoving display of solidarity. With my heart in Panamawith the victims and their families  I have come to theUnited Nations  because the tragedy unfolding in mycountry highlights more than ever the need to tacklethe problem of poverty urgently.The United Nations was conceived as a way ofpreventing war and restoring peace. Today  all thecountries of the world have to be able to feel that theycan come to the United Nations to solve their problemsand not just to discuss them. If that is to happen  theUnited Nations must reform.For some years  from this rostrum  heads of Stateand Government have been urging the need for reform and the Secretary-General has welcomed that initiative.I want to join my voice to theirs so that once and for allwe actually carry out the reform. We cannot afford towait any longer or the people of the world will losefaith in the United Nations.We do not need an organization with a gloriouspast. We need an organization with a future  one thatcan tackle the world’s most serious problems. For thatreason it is necessary that the principal organs be morerepresentative.There are political struggles and armed conflictson every continent. There is no region of the worldwhere peace and harmony reign. Some are regionalconflicts  some are internal ones  but they are no lessbloody for that. And yet  there is one struggle that isglobal in dimension and that requires global solutions.I am speaking of the struggle against hunger andpoverty. That was the subject of a 20 Septembermeeting of more than 60 world leaders  who wereresolved to tackle it with all the tools available to them.I need not dwell on the tragic numbers  but I doendorse what has been said by the moving force of thatmeeting  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva  President of Brazil:“peace can never grow out of poverty and hunger”.In Latin America the threat to democracy posedby military coups has been significantly reduced. It isno longer army divisions that threaten democracy; it isthe legions of the poor and the unprotected who candestroy democratic institutions if their basic needs arenot met.But then we face a contradiction: the morepoverty there is in a given country  the less likelihoodthere is of being able to defeat it. Countries are crushedby public debt. Millions of people are being born todayalready owing more than they will earn in their entirelifetime. Often those debts are the result of pastdeficits  which  owing to excessive bureaucracy  badprojects or corruption  produced no tangible benefitsfor the people. The fiscal problems facing most of thecountries in our region make the situation even worse as Governments lack the resources they need to try tomeet the minimum needs of their people.This analysis is not a new one. The “lost decade”of the 1980s was the result of exactly the sameproblems  although there was also an internationaleconomic crisis and an absence of democratic28legitimacy in most of the continent at that time. Thereare  however  undeniable differences between thatperiod and the present. On the one hand  over the pastfew years unprecedented wealth has been generated while at the same time the number of poor has grown.On the other hand  although more countries aredemocratic today  there is also a greater amount ofdebate on how to effectively address society’simmediate problems.Democracy  as a system of government  ended upbeing conflated with the limitations of individuals while in truth the problem was that Governments wereunable to produce effective responses. The problem isthus not democracy; the problem lies withGovernments.Direct help to Governments  in the form of loansor grants  has not been enough or sufficiently effectiveto solve the problems of poverty or the lack of growththat the aid was supposed to correct. Those of us whohave the responsibility of governing and trying toprovide answers cannot forget that  for many  patiencehas yielded to despair. The immediacy of their needsdemands immediate solutions  which are not always tohand. That means that we have to speak out clearlyabout the problems  that we have to administer ourStates with transparency and that we have to fightcorruption in order to win back the trust of people whoare tired of so much deception and frustration.Latin America needs a new economic agenda  onenot based at just throwing money at social problems. Itneeds an agenda that seeks to understand the complexnature of our countries and institutions. Stoppingpayments  restructuring  adjustments — that is a roadthat we have been down before  and our region was theloser.The new agenda requires absolute transparency inpublic administration and accountability. But the taskof making public administration more efficient andmore transparent takes time and resources. But intereston debt builds up  and the needs of a large sector of thepopulation also increase.Progress in reducing poverty among our peopleswill require much effort and great resources from thepoor countries; to a degree  creditor countries andmultilateral agencies could compensate them byreducing public debt. In that regard  we propose that arelief clause be included in the lending programmes ofthe international financial institutions to reduce futureinterest on our public debt if we meet agreed goals onpoverty reduction. That would be one way ofcompensating Governments for their efforts to alleviatepoverty while also allowing them to meet theirfinancial obligations.In the past few years  people’s concerns haveshifted dramatically. Cultural heritage  natural wealth biodiversity and animal species threatened withextinction must all be protected. It seems thatsometimes financial resources are found more easilyfor those issues than for the millions of human beingswho are dying every day of hunger  or for those whoare barely surviving  unable to live a decent life  andwithout hope.I would like to join in the widespread call on theinternational community to devise and implement boldand generous approaches to tackle poverty. It isshameful that in the technological age  when so manythings have been invented that were unimaginable just10 years ago  that we have not been able to invent away for millions of people in the world to escape fromthe subhuman conditions to which poverty condemnsthem.Sometimes it seems that international aid isprovided only if there are desperate tragedies or acts ofterrorism. Of course  when nations are victims ofnational disaster or terrorism such internationalassistance is necessary and commendable. I would liketo take this opportunity to reiterate Panama’s resolve tocombat terrorism wherever it may occur. But we mustnot forget that many more people die because ofpoverty than in wars or natural disasters.I am pleased to report that Panama has done itsduty and has stood by the international community inits efficient and safe management of the Canal. Weshall continue in future to manage that important arteryof international trade in the same way  so that it willbe  as it has been today  open to shipping from allcountries of the world.I will return to my country optimistic  because Ihave seen here a determination to fight poverty. I havesensed the solidarity of the international community inthe face of natural disaster and I have renewed mybelief that when there is the will  when there is faithand determination  the most difficult tasks can beaccomplished."
"136",5541,"PER",59,2004,"Allow me to join previous speakers in congratulatingyou on your election to the presidency of the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly.The world of the twenty-first century faces aparadox. It is unified globally in the areas ofproduction  such as trade  finance and in the digitalrevolution of information and communicationtechnology - yet it is divided by the increase inconflicts  civil strife and transnational terrorism  aswell as cultural and ethnic violence. The world isunified by universal values  such as democracy  humanrights and respect for freedom of expression and theenvironment - yet it is divided when democracyclashes with social demands for more jobs and lesshunger.Those contradictory trends of globalization andfragmentation jeopardize governance not only at theinternational level  but also within nations. Conflictssharpen; many poor States are rocked by domestic andexternal violence; terrorist organizations and traffickersin drugs  weapons and persons are emerging andamassing devastating global power.Since the end of the cold war  more than 30 civilconflicts have caused approximately 5 million deathsand created almost 17 million refugees. In 2004  theUnited Nations has been administering 15peacekeeping operations and 15 special politicalmissions. That means that 16 per cent of MemberStates are affected by issues undermining peace andinternational security.In a context in which no single Power can assureglobal governance  in a world where fragmentationabets nuclear threats  both nations and peoples demandurgent decisions ó decisions ensuring globalgovernance based on international law  increasedrespect for the United Nations  within a renewed andstrengthened multilateralism  and the reinforcement ofthe values of peace and international justice.In the global era  the world requires broadconsensus. Peru considers that the best solution is to befound through both change and continuity. We muststabilize the world political situation and generate aninternational alliance for development and socialjustice. We call for continuity in order to attain thegoals of the United Nations. We call for peace security  juridical equality of States  the non-use offorce  the prohibition of aggression  the internationalrule of law governing relations among States international cooperation  economic and socialdevelopment and respect for human rights ó all ofwhich are more necessary and have more validity todaythan ever before.We also propose a change of tools  mechanismsand measures. The reform of the Security Council mustbe tackled realistically  bearing in mind its role as amechanism for collective security for the internationalcommunity as a whole. The people want a SecurityCouncil with guarantees of legitimate and effectivedecisions.5Peru is a country whose diplomatic tradition since the nineteenth century  has supportedmultilateralism as the best means for internationaldecisions  particularly to promote peace anddevelopment. Peru participates in United Nationspeacekeeping operations. My country is contributingmilitary troops in Cyprus  on the border betweenEthiopia and Eritrea and in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  and we are participating in Liberia and inCÙte díIvoire. Recently  my Government decided tosend a fully equipped company to help achievestability  security and the reinstitutionalization ofdemocracy in the Republic of Haiti.As a result of our long-standing participation inmaintaining peace and security and in promotingdevelopment  Peru has announced its candidacy for anon-permanent seat on the Security Council during theperiod 2006-2007. We are grateful for the considerablesupport that we have received and for the favourableconsideration given to our candidacy.Today  2.8 billion people live on $2 per day; 1.3billion people subsist on $1 per day. Moreover  in the1990s  social inequality became more pronouncedthroughout the world. According to the WorldwatchInstitute  that increase in inequality affected not onlypersonal incomes  but also access to water  food andenergy ó public goods essential for civilized life andsocio-political stability. Today  the decrease in personalincomes and the increase in inequality are collidinglike tectonic plates  producing tremors of socialdisintegration and international conflict.Therefore  we in the international communitymust understand that the peace  security and stabilityof the world system are not related solely to political military or strategic aspects. Peace and security havesocial and economic components. Poverty andexclusion militate against peace  security anddemocracy. Social exclusion produces violence instability and national and international fragmentationand renders democracy fragile. We cannot overcomethat situation if we do not cause globalization to have ahuman face and to become a positive force thatprovides tangible benefits to all nations and all humanbeings.The rule of law and the international legal ordermust guarantee access to justice and respect for humanrights. The rule of law must prevent impunity. At thesame time  democratic societies must maketransparency and the fight against corruption truepolicies of the State.Peru  before the process of recovering itsdemocracy  was captive to corruption  systematichuman rights violations and the subjugation of justiceto political power. The corrupt and authoritarianGovernment hijacked democracy  torturedsystematically and made corruption a tool of politicalpower. Today  the free consciences of Peru demand thatthose responsible be brought to justice. Therefore  Iappeal to the Government of Japan to contribute toaccess to justice by authorizing the extradition offormer President Alberto Fujimori for the crimesagainst humanity with which Peruvian justice hascharged him  including his alleged responsibility foracts of torture  forced disappearances  summaryexecutions and acts of corruption. Democratic Peruguarantees a fair trial and due process under the rule oflaw. I make this appeal in the conviction that the ruleof law and the international legal order must guaranteeaccess to justice. To deny such access is tantamount toenshrining impunity  and I am sure that theinternational order is not prepared to consider itself anaccomplice to such impunity. We hope that that willnot happen."
"137",5588,"PHL",59,2004,"It gives me greatpleasure to congratulate you  Sir  as you ably andwisely guide our deliberations at the fifty-ninthsession. Allow me also to take this opportunity toexpress my delegation’s appreciation to Mr. JulianHunte of Saint Lucia for his successful stewardship ofthe work of the fifty-eighth session.The world has changed a great deal since ourhopes and aspirations were enshrined in the Charteralmost 60 years ago. What has not changed  butremains unaltered  is our collective desire to build asafe  tolerant and secure world  anchored in justice andsocial progress.What has not changed is the very spirit anddriving force that brought us together — we  thepeoples of the United Nations. Those opening words ofthe Charter remind us that the United Nations is acreation of the peoples of the world. Those wordscompel us to recall that our Organization has beenentrusted by our peoples with the sacred task oftranslating their aspirations into reality. They are wordsthat tell us that we are assembled today not only asdelegates of our Governments  but also asrepresentatives of our peoples. With those words  theCharter freed the world from the notion that only Statesmatter. With those words  the people were placed at theheart of our United Nations.Today  the technologies and discoveries that makethe world smaller and should bring us together arebeing used to tear us apart. Today  new forms ofpolitical  economic and social division directly threatenour people and the values and dreams they hold dear.These threats have the potential to overwhelm thegains of our Organization and to divide our peoples.All these factors have given rise to clamour fordecisive reform in the United Nations. We should startwith the basic reform of the structures andrelationships that define powers and responsibilities.For our Organization  this means pursuing earnestreforms in the Security Council; the General Assemblyand its subsidiary bodies; and the Secretariat. Butaddressing the most basic elements is also the mostdifficult thing to do.Any planned reform of the United Nations shouldbe endorsed by consensus by all 191 Member States.Any reform of the Security Council should give dueconsideration to the views of the five permanentmembers  as they will have the final say in the matter.15Any reform should also recognize that a country likeJapan deserves to be considered for a seat as apermanent member.We must all put our creative energies to work spare no effort and ignore no avenue or opportunity inbringing greater peace and progress to our peoples.Religion and religious leaders have a role to play infostering tolerance and greater understanding amongpeoples. They bring unique perspectives to thepromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms.Inter-faith dialogue between the peoples ofdifferent civilizations should also be encouraged. Deepand historic divisions can be healed through a dialoguebetween peoples of different faiths and civilizations.The Philippines will work with like-mindeddelegations in support of efforts to broaden such adialogue.Our peoples’ differences  whether of belief or ofculture  should not be a basis for misunderstanding orconflict. But most of all  reform must begin by placingthe welfare and interests of the peoples of the world atthe forefront our deliberations.In the 15 minutes that it will take me to delivermy remarks  60 people will have died of tuberculosis.By the time the curtain falls on a Broadway show  250persons  mostly women and children  will have beentrafficked into forced servitude or prostitution. By thetime we wake up tomorrow morning  3 000 childrenwill have died of malaria and a further 6 000 childrenwill have perished for lack of clean water.Instead of having school books in their hands over 300 000 children in conflict areas have theirfingers on the triggers of automatic rifles.HIV/AIDS kills 3 million people a year; millionsof refugees crowd camps. One fifth of the world’spopulation still live in abject poverty  barely subsistingon less than the price of the newspaper sold around thecorner from our hotels.Terrorism  the spread of weapons of massdestruction and the massive proliferation of small armsdirectly threaten the people and their livelihood andrepresent an assault on their dignity.Critical flashpoints  most of which are in my partof the world  have the potential for armed conflict thatwould certainly place people and their futures at graverisk.As a founding Member of the United Nations andas a current member of the Security Council  thePhilippines places its faith in the Organization for themaintenance of international peace and security  thepromotion of social progress and better standards oflife and the protection of the fundamental rights ofindividuals.People antedate the evolution of statehood. As weplace people at the centre of the United Nations  Iwould like to highlight the need to protect their livesand the importance of ensuring their livelihood andpromoting their dignity.We must allow our peoples to live free from fear to live in a safe and secure world. Terrorism poses aserious threat not only to the lives of our people  butalso to the values and ideals that define our societies.Terrorism reduces people to mere pawns in a ruthlessgame of competing beliefs and ideologies.The rubble in Jakarta has been cleared. Flowerscover the little graves in Beslan. But the enemies of allpeoples are still lurking in the shadows  conspiring andplotting  with evil in their hearts and the blood ofinnocents on their hands.The Philippines condemns all forms of terrorism.No cause or dogma can ever justify its use. Longbefore 11 September 2001  the Philippines and itspeople suffered from the scourge of terrorism. We haveseen the face of terror and felt its deadly touch. Wewere among the first in our region to join theinternational war against terror. The Philippinesbelieves that conflicts should be addressed beforeterrorism can begin to define or exploit them. This canbe done by working together with other nations.President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo believes thata new kind of peace has to be developed for a new kindof war  waged by terrorists. She proposes a new globalalliance to alleviate poverty and remove it as abreeding ground for resentment and conflict.With the help of the Organization of the IslamicConference  violent secessionism has given way topeaceful autonomy in southern Philippines. Thepotential for terrorism to breed has been drasticallyreduced. In partnership with Malaysia  we are closer toa negotiated peace with the remaining secessionists who themselves have renounced terror. With Norwayas a facilitator  prospects remain for peace talks with16one of the world’s few remaining communist rebelgroups.Another important dimension of human securityis economic. At the national level  economic securitymeans primarily providing livelihood for the people. Inthe Philippines  President Arroyo has enshrined thatgoal in her 10-point programme of action for 2004 to2010. The programme calls for the creation of6 million jobs in six years by giving more opportunitiesto entrepreneurs  tripling the amount of loans to smalland medium-size enterprises and developing 1 millionto 2 million hectares of land for agribusiness.If we are to maintain economic security  theinternational community should also make job creationa priority goal in international economic cooperation.The General Assembly should look more closely atinnovative tools that will help spur economic growth particularly in developing countries. Greater attentionshould be focused on how micro-credit ormicrofinance — an area where the Philippines hasmade significant strides — could serve as aninstrument to alleviate the conditions of the poorest ofthe poor.Creative ways to solve the lingering debt issueand the spiralling cost of energy should also beconsidered. We need to ease the burden of debtservicing and to channel those meagre resources towhere they are needed most. Each day  developingcountries pay the rich nations $717 million in debtservice. Every baby born in the developing worldalready owes $482 at birth. Every year  sub-SaharanAfrica pays $10 billion in debt service — four times asmuch money as the countries in the region spend onhealth care and education. The wise mobilization ofdomestic resources  such as remittances fordevelopment  should also be carefully studied.Remittances by migrants — much greater than the totalamount of overseas development assistance —alleviate the poverty of the family members remainingin their country of origin.Economic security prospers when the playingfield is level for both developed and developingcountries. Levelling the economic playing field ensuresthat the fruits of globalization will benefit the people interms of better opportunities  more jobs and improvedlivelihood. International trade  investment anddevelopment are crucial tools in raising the people’sstandard of living. But the people of poor countriescontinue to face persistent barriers to their productsfrom the developing world. Those barriers exist despitethe strictures of the international trading system emphasizing the need for an open  rule-basedmultilateral trading system.Economic crises in developing countries result inimmediate threats to human security. When people donot know where their next meal will come from orwhen their crops will fail  human security iscompromised. In an interlinked global economy  crisesspread rapidly. The prevention and mitigation of suchcrises in developing countries also enhances humansecurity in developed countries. A World Bank studyshows  for instance  that the total elimination ofagricultural subsidies in rich countries would increaserural income in low- and medium-income countries byabout $60 billion a year.Needless to say  international trade policy needsto be fair  not only to farmers of the developed world but also to their counterparts in the developingcountries. As a start  a substantial reduction inagricultural subsidies for farmers in rich countrieswould go a long way towards helping their fellowagricultural workers beyond their borders. There is alsoa need for developed countries to implement theircommitments to allocate 0.7 per cent of their grossnational product for official development assistance.Again  official development assistance is an instrumentto help people help themselves — a socialresponsibility that is more pronounced now  in an eraof increasing globalization. The inexorable pace ofglobalization fuels new phenomena and creates newchallenges to human security. The fluidity of capital technology  culture and even people should beacknowledged as inherent to globalization and shouldbe harnessed for the good of the people.Democracy and freedom — central elements toensuring the rights and dignity of the people — shouldbe encouraged and promoted  particularly in countriesthat are in transition or recovering from conflict. It isin that spirit that the Philippines supports the call forthe establishment of a democracy fund. The Philippinesis prepared to provide technical support and training inthe areas of governance  the administration of justice electoral processes and similar subjects  withthird-party support. We will share our knowledge — aresult of our own experience as Asia’s firstdemocracy — since we have had to struggle to regainand preserve that very same democracy.17The world should continue to support the peopleof Iraq in their valiant effort to create a democratic free  pluralistic and secure nation. The Philippinesstands ready to assist in implementing Security Councilresolution 1546 (2004) on Iraq  which wasunanimously adopted during our presidency of theCouncil last June. The United Nations has a significantrole to play in Iraq in the political process leading tothe elections scheduled for January next year  and itdeserves the full support of the internationalcommunity in its efforts to build a stable and peacefulIraq.Conflict has devastating effects on the safety andsecurity of people. The deliberate targeting of innocentcivilians as victims is increasingly being used as aweapon of war and as a tool of terrorists. Themovement of people across borders reinforces theinterdependence of countries  facilitates the transfer ofskills and knowledge and stimulates economic growthand development. In order to protect the security ofmigrants  we must give them the legal status that willenable them to gain access to basic services and willensure the protection of fundamental rights. TheInternational Convention on the Protection of theRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of TheirFamilies entered into force on 1 July 2003. We takethis opportunity to call on all our friends to make everyeffort to accede to the Convention.The interdependence and interlinkages among thepeoples of the world require that human securityshould top the agendas of local  national  regional andglobal governance. Human security addresses thechallenges of the twenty-first century  responds to ourpeoples’ aspirations as enshrined in our Charter andreinvigorates the United Nations in the process.Finally  in a world where people are sometimesreduced to images on a screen and their sufferingdistilled into pixels and fonts  perhaps we should againbe reminded that  when we gave life to the UnitedNations almost 60 years ago  we ushered in a new erain the human saga  embarking on our historic journeywith the words: “We the peoples of the UnitedNations ...”."
"138",5607,"PLW",59,2004,"This is a momentousyear for our country as we celebrate  on 1 October  thetenth anniversary of our independence and ourmembership in this institution. Palau was the lastcountry to emerge from the Trusteeship System  havingbeen administered by the United States under thesupervision of the United Nations longer than anycountry in the world. It was the United Nations thatprovided Palau with a willing forum in which toexpress and ultimately achieve our right to sovereignty and for that we are ever thankful. I am also happy toobserve  on this tenth anniversary  that this year weestablished  for the first time  a permanent mission inNew York so that we can enhance our ability to meetour international responsibilities.It was the United States  through itsadministration and willing cooperation during ourpeaceful emergence into independence  that assured usthe liberty and the values that guide us today. For thatextraordinary legacy  we today express our deepgratitude to the United States of America.This is a good year for Palau to deepen itsinvolvement  since it coincides with the worldíspreparation for the Mauritius conference and theincreased emphasis at the United Nations on the uniquechallenges facing small island developing States.While images of swaying palm trees and white sandbeaches prevail in the world's imagination  they areonly part of the story. In truth and in fact  theremoteness and the isolation of Palau make it a verydifficult place to develop a self-reliant economy provide medical care and education to its people anddeter aggression and terrorism. Fuel and transportationprices are among the highest in the world. After foursuccessive colonial administrations  our infrastructureis quite incomplete  and our most promising hope forthe development of a sustainable economy  our pristineenvironment  is threatened by factors beyond ourcontrol  such as the failure of all industrializedcountries to reach agreement on implementing theKyoto Protocol.We have created a democratic society andensured human rights for our people  but withoutinternational focus  we will not be able to provide hopeand opportunity to our children  and we will continueto watch as they leave their homeland to seek aneducation and a career elsewhere. For no matter whatstatistics may be advanced  what references to grossnational product may be debated  until we can provideour children with the incentive to stay and help buildour country  we will have lost. Thus  the Mauritiusprocess is critical for Palau  and we trust that thedeveloped countries of the world will embrace it.21Similarly  we trust that United Nations agencieswill sharpen their focus on the small island developingStates and correct what we view as a currentimbalance  in support of the fragile small States of theworld. We applaud the recent efforts of the GlobalEnvironmental Facility (GEF) to streamline assistanceto Palau through the creation of an innovative NorthPacific subregional programme that will build ourcapacity to protect our environment and create asustainable economy.We are troubled  however  by a growing tendencyin the donor community to demand that small countrieslike ours prove our capacity before assistance can bedelivered. This is a catch-22 situation that threatens tohalt our development. The only way we can build ourcapacity to execute projects that will save  for example our unique biodiversity is to experience the hard workof completing projects and learning from ourexperience.This observation does not mean that we arereluctant to accept the obligations and responsibilitiesinherent in receiving assistance. We are willing andeager to be monitored by the international communityin our performance. We firmly believe that we shouldbe held accountable for the quality and thetransparency of our efforts.It is ironic that tiny countries such as ours  whereso many of the worldís environmental treasures exist are denied the assistance they need due to a perceivedlack of capacity to navigate the unwieldy bureaucracies ofthe international organizations charged with protectingthose very treasures.As already noted  the failure of the world to cometo agreement on implementing the Kyoto Protocol willcontribute to the destruction of our marine andterrestrial resources. Palau  like many other smallisland developing States  is a window on the worldísfuture in this regard and must be carefully observed.We urge the GEF to create real funding opportunitiesfor adaptation and mitigation measures in a proactiveand streamlined fashion before it is too late.In a similar vein  we are increasingly aware of theparticularly damaging fishing practice of deep-seabottom trawling. Increasingly employed on the highseas as coastal fisheries are depleted  this techniqueentails dragging heavy equipment along the seabed completely destroying established coral  sponge andrelated communities that have taken centuries todevelop. We are a culture of fishing people and findthis practice unacceptable. As we participated with ourPacific colleagues in eliminating drift-net fishing someyears ago  we now call upon the world to join us indeclaring a moratorium on deep sea bottom trawlingbefore this practice does any more irremediable damage.Last month  Palauís accession to the Group ofAsian States created the largest regional grouping inthe United Nations. Two critical issues involving ourAsian region also have great global significance.First  for the United Nations to be effective atensuring international peace and security  all nations large and small  should be represented in itsdeliberations. The Republic of China on Taiwan shouldno longer be kept on the sidelines of the mostimportant international Organization. The principle ofuniversality should be applied so that the 23 millionpeople of Taiwan can bring their talents  their energyand their principled democratic positions to theorganizations  bodies  specialized agencies andprogrammes of the United Nations  thereby aiding therest of the world in pursuing our mutual agenda.Secondly  and also in pursuit of the most effectivemeans to strengthen the credibility of the UnitedNations  Palau urges the United Nations to reform theSecurity Council to reflect the reality of theinternational community in the twenty-first century sothat countries that play a major role in the maintenanceof international peace and security always participatein the decision-making process of the Security Council.Palau believes that the Security Council should beexpanded to include additional developing anddeveloped countries as new members  and that Japanísstellar record of contribution is a solid basis for Japanísassumption of permanent membership of the SecurityCouncil. Japan has been a leader in internationalinitiatives for many years  and it is for that reason thatPalau takes this strongly felt position.Much of my presentation today has focused onthe enormous threats to vulnerable island States likePalau. We agree with the Secretary-General  whoobserved in his opening remarks to the high-levelsegment of the twelfth session of the Commission onSustainable Development  held at United NationsHeadquarters from 28 to 30 April 2004  that ìhigh-level political attention has been diverted fromsustainable development by the recent emphasis givento terrorism  weapons of mass destruction and the warin Iraq. But Palau also understands that the scourge ofglobal terrorism and its immoral violence againstinnocent people must be defeated. We are proud of oursons and daughters serving in the United Statesmilitary. Only last week  one of those sons  a Marinefighting side by side with Coalition forces in Iraq  paidthe ultimate price  marking the first death of a Palauanin the struggle with global terrorism. Our forces aresmall in number but  like Corporal Ngirmidol  large inloyalty  commitment and idealism. No one shouldmake any mistake about that.Palau is grateful to the United States for allowingus to achieve our independence and thus to join theinternational communityís quest for world peace.Nonetheless  a balanced international agenda whichincludes a determined focus on sustainable developmentis required if Palau is to achieve some measure ofeconomic self-reliance  and if the world as we know itis to survive."
"139",5648,"PNG",59,2004,"Mydelegation warmly welcomes you to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session andpledges our support. We acknowledge that you are alsofrom our Forum of Small States group and thereforeshare our common problems and challenges. Pleaseconvey my delegation’s commendation to yourpredecessor  the Honourable Julian Hunte  Minister forForeign Affairs of Saint Lucia  for his strongleadership of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession.Let me also take this opportunity to thank theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and his staff forthe good work they continue to do for our globalcommunity.We currently live in a changing world  one whichpast generations would even be amazed at. One of thegreatest achievements of the United Nations system isthe process of decolonization which has seen more than70 countries  including my own  take their rightfulplace in this Assembly. The process will not becomplete  however  until the remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories  including New Caledonia andTokelau  have exercised their inalienable right to self-determination.The world continues to witness great leaps intechnology  but at the same time we have also seen anincrease in some global dilemmas — poverty andhunger  the ravages of HIV/AIDS  wars  conflicts andterrorism  among others.Each of our countries face numerous challengesin this changing world and many of them are commonto all of us  regardless of our size  location and statusas developed or developing countries. Under thecircumstances  and more than ever before  we need towork together as a community of nations to help eachother address those challenges. Nowhere is that moreevident than in the domain of international peace andsecurity. A terrorist act committed in one State todayalso affects others elsewhere in the global community.We condemn the recent tragedy in Beslan  Russia the bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta andthe ongoing terrorist acts in the Middle East  Iraq  andother parts of the world. We also condemn the recent22tragedy in Darfur  the Sudan  and commend Canadaand Japan for their generous assistance.In circumstances like the foregoing  those mostaffected are innocent civilians  especially women andchildren. We therefore support the Secretary-General’sefforts to rally the international community tosubscribe to the treaties on the protection of civilians.In many cases  terrorists also take the lives ofUnited Nations and other humanitarian workers whoare doing unselfish and dedicated work under difficultcircumstances to serve our common humanity. In thatregard  we urge all Member States to support theConvention on the Safety of United Nations andAssociated Personnel.The situation in the Middle East remainsintractable  requiring constant and deliberate attentionby the United Nations  especially by the SecurityCouncil. Our own experience in the Bougainvilleconflict has taught us that there can be peace if allparties really desire it and are willing to resolve theirdifferences. We therefore urge all parties to the conflictin the Middle East — including Israel and Palestine  aswell as the major players  particularly the Quartet — toformulate a peace plan that is mutually acceptable toall.Papua New Guinea concurs with Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s recent statement to theAssembly at its 3rd meeting  which highlighted howimportant it is for the rule of law to prevail if we are toachieve peace and security in the world.Like many other Member States  Papua NewGuinea has acceded to the various counter-terrorismtreaties  pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373(2001). We believe that the reporting obligations underthe provisions of those treaties should be streamlinedto include regional reports  which would solve manycapacity issues for small nations with limitedresources. Because many of our regional legal  militaryand law enforcement agencies meet regularly  thosemeetings could provide the opportunity to compileregional reports on our fight against internationalterrorism. We believe that there is every desire to fulfiltreaty obligations; but if some of the more oneroustasks can be lightened for the small countries throughregional reports  bodies like the Counter-TerrorismCommittee  the Security Council  the GeneralAssembly and other related agencies could be betterserved.The small States are doing their best to fulfil theirobligations. Like many other Members States  we takeseriously our responsibilities and obligations to fightthe scourge of international terrorism and related issuesincluding the trafficking of people.The Pacific region advocates that the UnitedNations continue to closely and seriously study thenotion of collective security along with collectiveaction  ideas upon which many of our actions to bringstability to our region continue to be based.We are custodians of the biggest ocean and itsresources. Papua New Guinea  in particular  isendowed with 5 to 7 per cent of the world’sbiodiversity. We therefore share a commonresponsibility to ensure the protection and conservationof those resources which are of vital importance tohumanity.We encourage sustainable logging practices inorder to avoid the denuding of our vast rainforestresources. We condemn destructive fishing methodsand urge all Member States to adhere to sustainablemanagement and conservation regimes in order to meetfuture demands.At the Pacific Islands Forum  our leaders recentlyadopted a new vision for the Pacific region in the formof the Pacific Plan  which embraces four key areas:economic growth  sustainable development  securityand good governance.The Pacific Islands Forum will be engaging withthe European Union and other development partners toadvance the interests of the region  especially those ofeconomic growth and sustainable development.I share the view enunciated by other speakers thatthere can be no security without development  and thatequally  there can be no development without peaceand security. As important links  both need to beaddressed simultaneously if we want peace andsustainable development to prevail.We are pleased to see regional solidarity andassistance in conflict situations bear good results inBougainville and in our neighbour  the SolomonIslands. We also note that other regional actions takenby our leaders  such as the establishment of the PacificTransnational Crime Coordination Centre in Fiji enhance law enforcement and intelligence sharing inthe region.Concerning good governance  our leadersencouraged Pacific Member Governments to sign and23ratify the United Nations Convention againstCorruption in accordance with the spirit of theBiketawa Declaration.Over the past several years  Papua New Guineahas been the beneficiary of regional and internationalassistance in the rebuilding and return to normalcy ofthe island of Bougainville  after a decade-long conflict.We thank the members of the Security Council  bothpast and present  for their goodwill  patience andunderstanding in what has been an extremely painfulexperience for us. We have appreciated the support andcounsel of each member of the Council throughout thatimportant process. The conflict has greatly affected ournation and we have learned many lessons. We are re-establishing the rule of law in a profound and thoroughconstitutional process which will result in ademocratically elected autonomous government for thepeople of Bougainville. While we are close toachieving that  we are equally mindful that each steptaken now to finalize and consolidate the Bougainvilleconstitution is critically important for the autonomousgovernment of Bougainville to be sustainedsuccessfully.We continue to receive valuable support andassistance for the peace process from the Secretary-General as well as from our Pacific neighbours:Australia  New Zealand  Fiji  Tonga  Vanuatu and theSolomon Islands. Rebuilding and restoration ofservices in Bougainville has been greatly assisted byour development partners  including the UnitedNations Development Programme  the United NationsChildren’s Fund  the European Union  Australia  NewZealand and Japan  among others. We thank them alland look forward to their continued support andcooperation.We continue to be concerned about the securityand vulnerability of many of our small island States.As noted and endorsed by Pacific leaders at the recentPacific Islands Forum Summit in Samoa  theforthcoming International Meeting on the 10-yearreview of the Barbados Programme of Action  to beheld in Mauritius in 2005  will provide an opportunityto discuss with our development partners the manyissues which confront small island States  includingthose in our subregion.Development of women and children throughsports must have a special place in our quest toimprove the socio-economic well-being of our people.We are also working hard to implement the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and the outcomes of the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development (WSSD).The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to havedevastating consequences in many developingcountries. Our leaders in the Pacific region haveendorsed a regional strategy for HIV/AIDS noting theneed to address the issue urgently.Small arms and light weapons will alwaysthreaten the stability of many small States. Therefore we look forward to the continuing work towards aUnited-Nations-supported action plan for dealing withsmall arms.Climate change is a threat to all humankind andtherefore deserves the attention of the internationalcommunity  which must work together to address it.We are appreciative of the position of the UnitedKingdom as underlined by Prime Minister  The RightHonourable Tony Blair  in a recent statementhighlighting the threat of sea level rise and relatedissues. I am aware that there are scientific studiesbeing carried out  but the real issue is that the effects ofclimate change and global warming are being felt dailyby many island States. We in Papua New Guinea are nomore immune to climate change and sea level rise thanare many other small island States. The islandcommunities in Papua New Guinea  like those of ourneighbouring countries in the Pacific  are beingaffected adversely by sea level rise. We empathize withour colleagues from many other island States whichcontinually suffer from the effects of the problem. Ourplight is further compounded by natural disasters including the ravages of hurricanes  cyclones earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  floods and tsunamis.In that context  our sympathies go to the peoplesand the Governments of the Caribbean region especially those of Grenada  Haiti  Jamaica  Cuba  theBahamas and the Dominican Republic  among others as well as to the inhabitants of cities and towns of thesouthern states of the United States of America  whichhave been devastated by the recent hurricanes.As a global community we must pool ourresources and consider ways of mitigating the adverseeffects of climate change in order to help those Stateswhich are vulnerable. We applaud the intention of theRussian Federation to consider becoming a party to theKyoto Protocol and urge others to recognize theirresponsibility to the global community by doing thesame.24We look forward to the final report of the High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Changeappointed by the Secretary-General  which will formthe basis for high-level discussions on United Nationsreforms  including the expansion and composition ofthe Security Council. We believe Council membershipshould be expanded in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories to take into account the lack ofsufficient representation of developing countries in theAsia-Pacific  African and Latin American regions. Wealso believe that Japan and Germany should beseriously considered for permanent membership  withequal privileges and obligations. Consideration may begiven to other countries with appropriate qualificationsand integrity  particularly from the developing world.We also commend the indications from the Panelthat the definition of “hard” versus “soft” threats is nolonger relevant. That will allow a proper and objectivediscussion to be held  given that the resonance ofperceived threats can be viewed differently dependingon where the threat is.That said  Papua New Guinea believes thatreform of the United Nations system should becomprehensive and that the General Assembly shouldregain its pre-eminent role as the principal organ of theUnited Nations. That will enable all Member States large and small  to engage more meaningfully inaddressing all challenges in an effective way in orderto help the United Nations fulfil its role in the pursuitof a peaceful  just and prosperous world. That is thepurpose for which the United Nations was established.As we move towards next year’s review of theMillennium Development Goals and the sixtiethanniversary of the United Nations  we should all lookat the dire needs of the majority of humanity. Mydelegation believes that the Millennium DevelopmentGoals provide the blueprint for achieving thoseobjectives.Finally  let me conclude by reaffirming PapuaNew Guinea’s support for the one-China policy  whichprovides the sound basis for our bilateral relations withthe People’s Republic of China."
"140",5694,"POL",59,2004,"The agenda of thissession not only is full of importance and burningissues but also brings great hopes and expectations. Inhis statement  Mr. Bernard Bot  the Foreign Minister ofthe Netherlands  presented the European Union’sposition on the most important problems. Thatstatement fully reflects our thinking and concerns. Oneissue  however  that deserves our special attentiontoday is the reform of the United Nations.The present session of the General Assemblymust be remembered as a session of reform. It shouldlay the foundations for a profound andconsensus-based reflection on the relevance and theeffectiveness of the United Nations. This reflectionshould result in bold and imaginative decisionsproviding for a substantial overhaul of theOrganization. That is how we in Poland see thepreparations for the major event of 2005  which willundertake a comprehensive review of theimplementation of the Millennium Declaration Goalsand mark the sixtieth anniversary of the UnitedNations. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan noted  theUnited Nations is at a fork in the road. It is time to act.Every year  at the annual general debate of theGeneral Assembly  we take the floor to express ourviews — sometimes very critical — on the work of theOrganization. However  there is little evidence thatthese debates have had any significant impact on thefuture of the United Nations. Indeed  over the pastyears  the United Nations has seen many celebratoryand majestic gatherings. Unless we are able to build apolitical consensus and work out efficient forward-looking and workable decisions  we should cutdown on high-level ceremonies.46Poland has frequently voiced its conviction thatwe have to carry out a comprehensive  strategic reviewof the role of the United Nations in both its normativeand institutional aspects. It was with this in mind that on behalf of my country two years ago  I had theprivilege of putting forward the idea of a new politicalact for the United Nations. We are pleased to see that two years later  that belief and determination arewidely shared.Bearing in mind the unique momentum forreform  we look forward to the recommendations of theHigh-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change.They should provide the critical mass for the reformefforts and form a solid basis for further actions.In that context  I express my gratitude to themembers of the Panel  who came to Warsaw in Maythis year to consult with representatives of our part ofEurope on the most important conceptual aspects of thereform. The Warsaw Regional Conference was arewarding experience. The report issued following theconference has been made available to all delegationsat the Assembly.We have never had any problem with ideas excellent proposals and promising initiatives. Thebiggest obstacle to reform  rather  has been the lack ofpolitical consensus. The reform cannot be effective if itreflects the ideas of small groups of specialists orpoliticians alone. It must rely on a broad consensus andreflect a shared community of values and a sense ofidentity and purpose. Building that consensus is ourmajor  common task.The reform of the United Nations has to gobeyond institutional aspects  but we recognize the factthat institutions are important. Therefore  any reformpackage lacking ideas for reforming the organs of theUnited Nations would be considered inadequate by themajority of Member States.Poland shares the common opinion that it is hardto imagine strengthening the role of the SecurityCouncil without increasing its legitimacy. Today’sdiscussions on Council reform are focused mainly onexpanding its membership. However  the key to a moreeffective and legitimate Security Council does not liein the number of its members. A Council of24 members would probably have no more powerful avoice than a Council of 15. However  at the presentstage of discussions  we agree that the Security Councilhas to be expanded.One of the deficiencies of the United Nations  asit transpires from the conceptual discussions  is thatthere is too great a gap between the functions ofmandating and implementing. Therefore  we believethat it is the responsibility of the members of theSecurity Council to take the lead in providing politicaland material support for implementation of SecurityCouncil mandates. Security Council reform should bebased on the assumption that membership on theCouncil not only confers additional privileges but alsobrings additional responsibilities.The reform should preserve the inherent balanceamong the various organs of the United Nations. Whilewe support the tendency to expect more from theSecurity Council  any reform should be accompaniedby a more effective role for the General Assembly. Thetwo bodies should be seen as mutually supportive andreinforcing organs.However  in order to use the potential of theGeneral Assembly effectively and optimize itsperformance  we must profoundly change the way wespeak to one another in this forum. This must be aforum of dialogue. Occasionally  one hears jokes alongthe lines that the General Assembly is a place whereeverybody speaks but nobody listens. We have tochange that. We must start talking to one another moredirectly  more candidly. Let me assure the President  aswe congratulate him on the assumption of his post  thatPoland will support all his efforts in that regard.We need to enhance the performance of thebodies of the United Nations in social and economicdevelopment and the environment  as well as in other related  no less pressing areas. There is a real dangerthat the Millennium Development Goals will not befulfilled. That would deliver a serious blow to thecredibility of the United Nations. Given that thedistinction between socio-economic and political issuesis becoming increasingly blurred  we need a unifiedapproach.However  the existing efforts are often toofragmented  uncoordinated  and even contradictory andself-paralytic. In this context  the role of the Economicand Social Council and its reform should be strictlylinked with other United Nations bodies.In order to be comprehensive  the reform cannotstop at its institutional dimension. We need to revisitthe nature of current security challenges that exposethe deficiencies and shortcomings of our Organization47in the most systematic way. Predictable threats causedin the past by wars between countries have beenreplaced by indefinite and unpredictable threats causedby international terrorism  the proliferation of weaponsof mass destruction (WMDs)  and an increasingnumber of States in distress  whose Governments areunable to exercise effective power over their territoryand population. As a consequence  we are facing anunprecedented spread of terrorist acts and violence.In this context  on behalf of the people of Polandand myself  I express our deepest condolences to therelatives of the victims of the recent events in Beslan.We condemn this barbaric act and offer our solidaritywith the victims.To cope properly and successfully with the newnature of threats and challenges  it is necessary to usethis opportunity to examine the functional andconceptual basis of the Organization. Therefore Poland advocates that the important part of the reformshould be re-examination of the conceptual foundationsof the United Nations.In today’s world  new threats cast a new light onthe concepts that we use to regulate the internationalorder. Principles such as non-use of force  sovereignty legitimacy  accountability for both States and theirleaders  subsidiarity  complementarity  solidarity andresponsibility still occupy the highest level ofimportance. What we need is their adjustment to thecurrent reality  new political guidelines on how we  andhow Security Council members in particular  shouldtranslate them into action.Among these concepts  the principle of solidarity is for us more than just assisting the poor andunderdeveloped. Solidarity is an operational principlethat should generate cooperative attitudes for countriesin need  including those plagued by terrorism  naturaland man-made disasters and calamities  weak Statestructures  and so forth.One of the most important issues  in the light ofthe particularly threatening nexus of terrorism andweapons of mass destruction  is the principle of thenon-use of force. The following aspects should beexamined: anticipatory self-defence  humanitarianintervention and collective use of force withauthorization by the Security Council.In this respect  we need a code of conduct thatwill give us sufficient predictability as to how we  asMembers of the United Nations  will act on theinternational scene when employing the United Nationsas our instrument of choice and how we will make thebest use of its potential.We also hope that the reform will strengthen therole of the United Nations as a community of values.The United Nations was born to unite its Membersagainst threats and enemies. Today  it should unite usfor positive change in the consolidation of values  suchas human rights  democracy  social justice  anddevelopment  which constitute the backbone and moralfoundation of humankind.When preparing future decisions  we shoulddiscuss not only the content but also the form. Polandbelieves that the best approach to this is to have apolitical document that would both spell out thereinforced message about the role  principles andvalues  and also contain the necessary institutionaladjustments. We most definitely regard this documentas something more than a set of amendments to theUnited Nations Charter.We have to completely change the way weperceive the United Nations. For many years  most ofour countries have been asking themselves what theycan get from the Organization. Today  it is time for allof us to secure the future of the United Nations."
"141",5720,"PRK",59,2004,"On behalf of thedelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea  I should like at the outset to congratulate you Mr. Ping  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. I believe that yourskilful leadership of this session will yield fruitfulresults. I also appreciate the active efforts of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  to ensure thecentral role of the United Nations in addressing majorinternational issues.Four years have passed since we marked thebeginning of the new century. However  humankind isstill confronted with grave challenges in its efforts torealize the aspirations of peoples to build a peacefuland prosperous world.Unilateralism and high-handedness are becomingincreasingly evident  giving rise to aggression arbitrariness and instability in many parts of the world.Consequently  the vicious circle in which thesovereignty and interests of weak and small countriesare trampled for the sake of the exclusive interests ofcertain other countries continues unabated.Today  the main factors undermining internationalpeace and stability are unilateralism and high-handedacts based on the logic of power. The challenges facinghumankind today require  more urgently than ever United Nations Member States to strengthen their jointefforts to seek to ensure equitable internationalrelations based on multilateralism that fully observethe universal principles of respect for sovereignty equality  territorial integrity and mutual benefit.One of the regions where unilateralism and high-handedness are most rampant is North-East Asia — tobe more specific  the Korean peninsula. On the Koreanpeninsula  the national division forcibly brought aboutby outside forces has continued for more than half acentury  and the danger of war is snowballing  owing toextreme attempts by the United States to isolate andstifle the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea andto threats of pre-emptive strikes against it.At this very moment  all kinds of sophisticatedwar equipment are being deployed in and around the28Korean peninsula  targeting the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea.The acute political and military situationprevailing in and around the Korean peninsula provesclearly once again how right it was of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea to have built up its strongself-defensive military power to prevent war andensure peace  upholding the Songun policy of therespected General Kim Jong Il.The more vicious the attempts of outside forcesto isolate and stifle the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea  the higher our army and people  firmlyunited around their leader  hold up the banner ofSongun and push ahead with their struggle to build aprosperous and powerful State  with hope for the futureand devotion to the socialist cause.The Songun policy — the independent policy ofthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea — servesas a reliable deterrent to ensure peace and security  notonly on the Korean peninsula  but also in North-EastAsia and the rest of the world. We feel great pride andself-confidence in that respect.The reunification of the country is a prerequisitefor achieving a durable peace on the Korean peninsula and we are steadfast in our determination to achievenational reunification  independently  on the basis ofthe North-South Joint Declaration of 15 June.That Joint Declaration is one of nationalindependence  as well as a milestone of reunificationindicating the path towards national reconciliation collaboration and reunification.Various actions aimed at national co-prosperitywere begun in accordance with the lofty spirit of theJoint Declaration. The connecting of railways androads has proceeded  linking up the once-severed mainartery of the country; contacts and mutual travel at alllevels increased; and inter-Korean economiccooperation has been guaranteed at the institutionallevel.It is regrettable  however  that that tortuousprocess of reconciliation and cooperation between thenorth and the south of Korea was not sustained untildurable peace and reunification could be achieved.That is because the process is unwelcome to the UnitedStates  which is therefore dead-set against improvedrelations and the ongoing cooperative activities  whichare taking place at all levels between the north and thesouth of Korea.The United States should no longer hamper theefforts of the north and the south of Korea to achievenational reconciliation  collaboration and reunification.No matter how the situation may change in thefuture  the Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea will continue to strive to overcomeall the challenges of the anti-reunification forces withinand without  and to open up a broad path leading to theindependent reunification of the country throughnational cooperation  based on the great proposition “By our nation itself”.I would like to take this opportunity to clarifyonce again the principled stand of our Governmentregarding the nuclear issue between the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States.As I have made clear time and again from thisrostrum  the nuclear issue is the product of the deep-rooted hostile policy towards the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea pursued by the United States formore than half a century. In other words  given the factthat the current United States Administration  which isaccustomed to rejecting our system  has beenattempting to eliminate the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea by force  while designating it part ofan “axis of evil” and a target for pre-emptive nuclearstrikes  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea hasbeen left with no other option than to possess a nucleardeterrent.Peace is very precious to our people  who havebeen living for more than half a century with theheartbreaking pain of national division  forciblybrought about by outside forces  and under constantthreat from the world’s only super-Power.Our people aspire to peace more than others  butthey never beg for peace. The peace that they want toachieve is the peace of an independent life  not thepeace of slaves  deprived of freedom.The confrontation on the Korean peninsula todayis  in essence  a confrontation between foreign forcesintruding into someone’s home and the owners of thathome struggling to defend it.The nuclear deterrent capability of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea constitutes alegitimate means of self-defence to counter the ever-29growing nuclear threat of the United States and itsaggression against the Democratic People’s Republicof Korea  as well as a reliable means to defend thesovereignty  peace and security of the country.The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula isour goal  and it is the consistent position of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to addresspeacefully the nuclear issue between our country andthe United States through dialogue and negotiation.If the United States were to renounce practicallyits hostile policy towards the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea  including the cessation of itsnuclear threats  the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea would  accordingly  be willing to scrap itsnuclear deterrent.On the basis of that position  the Government ofthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea proposed apackage solution underpinned by the word-for-wordand action-for-action principle aimed at achieving apeaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. As the firststep towards that end  we offered the flexible “rewardfor freeze” proposal.In this regard  at the third round of the six-partytalks last June  the countries concerned shared the viewthat it was important that both sides adhere to theword-for-word and action-for-action principle and the“corresponding measures for freeze” approach  andreached an agreement.The “reward for freeze” proposal provides for theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to freeze allnuclear-weapon-related facilities and the output fromtheir operations  on the condition that the United Statesabandon its hostile policy  in particular its demandsrelating to the complete  verifiable and irreversibledismantlement of our nuclear programme and  at thesame time  that it lift its economic sanctions andblockade against the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea  remove the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea from its list of the sponsors of terrorism andparticipate in an energy compensation schemeinvolving two million kilowatts of capacity.By offering this proposal  it is our intention  first to build mutual confidence  and  eventually  to resolvethe nuclear issue fundamentally by addressing eachother’s concerns and meeting respective demands stepby step  on the basis of simultaneous actions  giventhat the current situation is characterized by hostilerelations between the two countries and extremedistrust.The proposed “reward for freeze” process wouldbe a confidence-building measure between theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates. Such confidence will be possible only when theUnited States rewards us for imposing a freeze.It is only natural that everything should have abeginning and an order. From that point of view  ourfreeze will be the first step towards the eventualdismantling of our nuclear programme. Of course  thefreeze will be followed by objective verification.In order to further clarify our will to dismantlethe nuclear deterrent  we had intended to include in ourfreeze a halt to the manufacture  testing and transfer ofnuclear weapons. The United States  however disregarding the common understanding and agreementreached at the third round of six-party talks  has furtherintensified its hostile and increasingly overt actsagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea even openly announcing that there would be no rewardfor the freezing and dismantling of our nuclearfacilities. Most recently  the United States adopted abill on human rights in North Korea and thus made itlegal to provide financial and material support foroverthrowing our system and to force third countries todo so.The United States has gone so far as to slanderand debase the supreme leadership of its dialoguepartner. It also forces us to disarm ourselves like adefeated nation  thus attempting to forcibly dismantleour nuclear programme first and to overthrow oursystem through complete  verifiable  irreversibledismantlement. Consequently  the basis of negotiations which were hardly moving towards a resolution of thenuclear issue  has been completely destroyed. If theUnited States wishes to coexist peacefully with theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea by abandoningits hostile policy  the nuclear issue will be resolvedproperly.With regard to the six-party talks  the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea is willing to resume them.Nevertheless  the increasingly hostile policy of theUnited States and the clandestine nuclear-relatedexperiments recently revealed in South Korea aremajor stumbling blocks to the continuation of the talks.Given this serious situation  in which the basis of thenegotiations has been totally destroyed and the secret30nuclear-related experiments in South Korea have notyet been clarified  we are unable to participate in thetalks aimed at discussing the nuclear-weaponsprogramme. Therefore  if the six-party talks are to beresumed  the basis for the talks demolished by theUnited States should be properly restored and the truthof the secret nuclear experiments in South Koreaclarified completely.I take this opportunity to extend my gratitude tothe States Members of the United Nations for theiractive support for and understanding of our principledstand and hope that they will continue to contribute tothe peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue betweenthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and theUnited States by maintaining their balanced approach.If the United Nations is to fulfil its mission forinternational peace and security and socio-economicdevelopment  it should play a leading role inaddressing the major international issues in accordancewith the objectives and principles of its Charter. To thatend  the United Nations should no longer tolerateunilateralism and high-handedness  which constitute aserious violation of the Charter and existinginternational law. Disputes should be resolvedpeacefully through dialogue and negotiations  and thereis no justification whatsoever for the unilateral use offorce  such as the armed invasion of sovereign States.Moreover  the Organization should bedemocratized so that all international issues can beresolved in the common interests of the Member States.In that regard  our delegation is of the view that theGeneral Assembly should be empowered to review andapprove the resolutions of the Security Council relatingto sanctions and the use of force directly affectinginternational peace and security.The reform of the Security Council should beundertaken in such a way as to enable it to ensure thefull representation and interests of the non-aligned andother developing countries  which account for theoverwhelming majority of Member States andcontribute to a fair solution to disputes. In addition practical measures should be taken to actively assistthe developing countries in their efforts to achievesustainable development by strengthening the role ofthe United Nations and its affiliated organs in thesocio-economic fields.The Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea will in the future continue to regardindependence  peace and friendship as the main idealsof its foreign policy and further strengthen its friendlyand cooperative relations with all States Members ofthe United Nations that respect our sovereignty andactively contribute to international efforts to establish ajust  equitable and new world order."
"142",5765,"PRT",59,2004,"At the outset I would like to state that Portugal  of course  endorsesthe statement made here by the presidency of theEuropean Union. Portugal wishes the United Nations tofulfil the central role it rightly deserves in thecommunity of nations. The United Nations is anindispensable international Organization. Without thisbody  of which we are all a part  the world would bemore unstable  less predictable and a place where theuniversal dream of peace and freedom would be nomore than a mirage on a far-off horizon.The United Nations was established in a distanthistorical context  but its ideas and basic values remaincontemporary. Portugal has a habit of recalling them on occasions such as this  because we feel that thiscommon undertaking is based on solid foundations.“We the peoples of the United Nations” believe in thedignity and the value of the human being  infundamental freedoms and in equality between menand women. We defend the primacy of internationallaw and tolerance in relations between peoples.But we also believe that one should notdistinguish between large and small nations  as we allhave a common interest in social advancement and inthe maintenance of international peace and security.These are the objectives of this Organization that needto be preserved and strengthened. This is  in goodtruth  our common cause  the cause of humankind.The month of September  in this city of NewYork  inevitably brings back memories of the horror ofthree years ago. It forces us to look at the challenges topeace that this Organization and all of us face today.The tragic events in Madrid  Beslan  Baghdad  Jakartaand other places show us that terrorism has entered thedeepest and darkest of shadows.No cause  no idea  justifies acts of pure barbarismand the spilling of innocent blood. Terrorism is anenemy of humankind. Moreover  Portugal believes thatit is up to the United Nations to contribute decisivelyto the establishment of a global strategy againstterrorism — a strategy that takes into account not onlythe obvious security-related responses  but also otherelements that may have the potential to generateviolence.33Let us be unyielding in the fight againstterrorism  but let us also engage ourselves in doing itcollectively. Let us take into account the laws and thevalues in whose name we are fighting  and should befighting  this evil.Hunger and poverty generate despair and maycause people to choose the path of violence. I wouldtherefore like to express my appreciation for theSummit of World Leaders for Action against Hungerand Poverty  promoted by President Lula da Silva which I had the honour to attend. We believe that thatmeeting was a fundamental step towards alleviatingcases of extreme poverty  which are unsustainable inmoral and political terms.If we act now  the world can change for thebetter; if we do not  its balance could becomeincreasingly difficult to manage. Portugal wants to beat the forefront of the future. That is why we believethat the sustainability of development and the defenceof natural resources are paradigms of a new era. Webelieve that the economic development of the twenty-first century will be sustainable only if it truly respectsthe balance of the planet and if the Kyoto provisionsare truly implemented.Does it make sense that an Organization like theUnited Nations continues to work in the twenty-firstcentury as it did 60 years ago? The United Nations wasborn at a time when there were no televisions  nocomputers  no cellular phones. Communications technologies and means of transportation have allchanged; DNA and the human genome have now beendiscovered; we surf the Internet on a global scale. Andyet the Organization that brings together the peoples ofthe world has the same structure that it had more thanhalf a century ago.The pace of change is breathtaking. The UnitedNations finds itself at a crossroads: while its relevanceis not challenged  we may question its effectiveness.But that is an issue that should be placed primarilybefore Member States. After all  the United Nations isan expression of our collective will. The Organizationcannot be seen as a distant reflection on which weproject our individual expectations  which often exceedthe limits of the mandates and the means that we makeavailable to it.In that regard  we support the work of the High-Level Panel established last year by the Secretary-General to examine current challenges to peace andsecurity. The strategies for strengthening theOrganization to be recommended by the Panel aim atpreserving what is best in the United Nations and atensuring that it is equipped with the means necessaryto promote real development  prevent conflicts andprotect human rights.Portugal unequivocally supports reform of theSecurity Council. We support its enlargement so that itwill better reflect the world of today  through arebalancing of its representativity. We have alreadystated before this forum — and we reaffirm today —our support for an increase in the number of permanentand non-permanent members. Portugal’s support forBrazil  Germany and Japan has been known to theGeneral Assembly since 1993. We have alreadyexpressed our support for India’s application forcandidacy  and  on behalf of the Government ofPortugal  I take the opportunity to express ourcommitment to seeing the African continentrepresented by a permanent seat on the SecurityCouncil.But we also want to improve the relationshipbetween the Council and other organs and agencies ofthe United Nations  as well as promoting greatertransparency in its decisions. The democracy that theOrganization defends is not compatible with obsoleteworking methods that often have a negative impact onthe image and the credibility of the United Nations andlead to its paralysis.Preventing conflicts is more important thansolving them. We should be aware that the usefulnessof the United Nations will ultimately be judged by itscapacity for conflict prevention. The proliferation ofcrisis situations has led to the current deployment ofapproximately 60 000 Blue Helmets in peacekeepingoperations  and that number continues to increase.Portugal has been with the United Nations inmany of its peacekeeping operations around the world.Here  I would like to pay tribute to my compatriots andto all others who have served on peacekeepingmissions  particularly those who have given their livesfor our common ideals.It is our hope that the Organization can betterdevelop its work in the field of conflict prevention.However  we still lack an efficient instrument for thedevelopment of that policy. Therefore  at the lastsession of the General Assembly  Portugal proposedthe creation of a commission to promote peace and34development  under the authority of and incollaboration with the Security Council and theEconomic and Social Council. Its objectives would beto regularly monitor countries in crisis or at risk and toensure the cooperation6 of regional and internationalinstitutions.We believe that our proposal remains relevant and we thank all those who have already improved itthrough suggestions and comments. This is an idea onwhich we have worked in particular with our partnersin the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries which I would like to warmly acknowledge on thisoccasion.Indeed  the Portuguese language is the unifyingfactor among hundreds of millions of people on fivecontinents. So that it can have strength as a vehicle ofcommunication and culture in the twenty-first century the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countriesneeds its members to make a clear commitment to theconnection between the past  the present and the future.The fact that Portugal is the cradle of the Portugueselanguage does not lead us to claim it for ourselvesalone with any special rights. The communities thatone joins as a result of specific interests  howeverlegitimate  can never erase one’s own community —one’s family  spirit  language  culture and identity.“Know thyself” was already inscribed at the foot of theTemple of Delphi.Nowhere are we confronted with such a hugepredicament regarding the ability of the United Nationsto act as in Iraq. Iraq needs the support of theinternational community. The Iraqi people  ravaged bydecades of dictatorship and war  deserve such support.And we should give the United Nations the necessarymeans to fulfil in its entirety the mandate provided bythe Security Council. But we must also understandclearly that the international presence in Iraq —approved by the Security Council and by the IraqiInterim Government — is by its own natureprovisional.It is time for the international community to unitein its efforts to ensure that the Iraqi people again findthe path towards peace and development. We cannotchange the past  but we must assume that the future canstill be influenced in a positive way. Thus  we mustquickly restore unity if our Organization is not to sufferpermanent collateral damage as a result of the Iraqicrisis.For democracy to succeed in Iraq  and for thatcountry to maintain its unity  it is essential that itspeople have a say  through elections  regarding the waythey wish to be governed. It is also important that theagreed political timetable be honoured  or we mayseriously compromise the rightful expectations of theIraqi people and Government. We cannot allow thosewho generate instability through unthinkable acts ofterrorism to have the power to veto the establishmentof a democratic regime in Iraq. Elections are the onlyway to enable the Iraqi people to meet the destiny ofdemocracy and freedom to which they are entitled.Peace  freedom and democracy are also at stakein other parts of the world we inhabit. We cannot lookaway from the tragedy unfolding in Darfur. Ourcollective security also requires the effectiveinternational control of the production of nuclear chemical and bacteriological weapons and the means todeploy them.For the maintenance of international security  it isalso essential that the Organization continues to pushfor the resumption of the Middle East peace process.The existing status quo is unacceptable. Israel andPalestine need to learn to coexist in peace and security within internationally recognized borders and withoutartificial partitions.We cannot replace the dichotomy betweenliberalism and collectivism with another betweenliberty and peace on the one hand and terror anddictatorship on the other. The world has alreadyentered a new era. The peoples of the whole world  asreferred to in the Charter of the United Nations demand a new contract between the governed and thosewho govern.The three classic powers of Montesquieu are nolonger the only ones in the government of the peoples.Those who believe so are lost in time. There is nothingworse than erring in our perception of reality. There arepowers that are not as they were and others thatMontesquieu  Locke and the drafters of liberalrevolutions could not know of  because they did notexist or because  over time  they have changedconfiguration. One need only think of the power of themedia over people’s lives today.Our peoples want to feel strength in the presentand faith in the future. For that reason  I shall end myaddress the way I began: stressing the indispensabilityand the centrality of the United Nations in the daily35lives of free and sovereign nations. We belong to anOrganization that has restored hope to many peoplesand human beings by bringing the light of freedom tothose who lived in oppression. Timor-Leste is anexcellent example of the ability of the United Nationsto do good.But one should also stress the attention theUnited Nations has given to the vulnerable  childrenand the disabled and to the promotion of genderequality. For this Organization  humankind is not anabstract entity. The dialogue between cultures civilizations and religions  which Portugal upholds  isan integral part of the daily work of the UnitedNations.We are part of an Organization dedicated tomaking peace and preventing war. We are party to acollective project in the service of human rights andfundamental freedoms. We have the strength of ourconvictions. And  as Pope John Paul II has stated  weknow that peace is not weakness  but strength."
"143",5811,"PRY",59,2004,"Today our continent is experiencing a time of greatopportunity  yet it is also beset by serious threats including a falling standard of living for the masses radical adjustment measures  the globalization offinancial capital and a lack of access to markets indeveloped countries - all of which have notcontributed to generating sustained economic growth and even less to reducing poverty and inequality. Thegreat challenge before us is to redouble our effortsdaily to eradicate this cancer by strengthening publicinstitutions and forging a new social ethic  as well as anew international order with multilateral bodies thattruly contribute to peace throughout the world  humandevelopment and the sharp reduction of poverty  socialinequalities and the exploitation of man by man andnation by nation.The United Nations  this noble institution  mustnot lose sight of its historic memory  its raison díÍtreand the objectives that led to its creation  if its effortscurrently under way are to result in healthy attitudechanges and a greater political capacity to instituteregulatory frameworks that can put a stop to economicDarwinism and conflicts throughout the world.Today  more than ever  the possibility of buildinga more just world  free from such painfulcontradictions  depends upon the inclusion of the lessdeveloped countries in the globalized economy and thepolitical will to overcome pure market forces. Theindustrialization of the United States  Germany andJapan in the nineteenth century could be described insimilar terms  as could their emergence from theirrelative backwardness compared with Great Britain the pioneer nation of that time.The failure throughout almost all of LatinAmerica to overcome its backwardness  poverty anddependency is frequently due to selfishness andhistoric impediments to advantageous connectionsbetween our national economies and the worldwidemarket. If this seems to be a recurrent condition  thenwe should constantly keep in mind the message of theConsensus of Brazil: we must govern globalization ifwe are to turn it into a source of opportunity for all  ifglobalization is not to be what it has become ó a forcesynonymous with marginalization  exclusion orconquest  dependent on markets and cheap labour which leads to a form of semi-slavery in manycountries.I wish to propose to the General Assembly jointaction that can be taken in four areas.First  social investment throughout the continentmust reach levels that will make it possible to attainthe Millennium Development Goals. To that end  thepoorest countries  which clearly cannot obtain suchlevels of investment  could have recourse to acounterpart fund for social equity with soft financingcoming from international organizations and unilateralcontributions.Secondly  we realize that not everything can besolved with money. Money  when it is misused weakens and corrupts. Accordingly  we must alsocommit ourselves to carrying out the necessaryinstitutional reforms to ensure the proper formulation implementation and assessment of social policies. Andwe must be ready to ensure that access to theaforementioned funds will lead to wide-reachinginnovations in the management of publicadministration  demonstrable by means of indices onefficiency and transparency.Thirdly  international organizations mustincreasingly realize that economic and social reformmust flow from the experience and wisdom of thosecountries themselves  with their own formulas that arein keeping with their cultural standards and thatinvolve all the representatives of civil society.Fourthly  with growing levels of poverty it isimpossible to meet the burden of external debtservicing. There must be a new  realistic policy thatwill put forward rational terms on future payment ofdebt  terms that will make it possible to lay the basisfor sustained and equitable development  terms whichallow us to meet our commitments without pushing our19people into irreversible poverty. It is important to placethe needs of the poor and dispossessed over therepayment of the debt.That is why we must imaginatively and skilfullydevise alternative financing mechanisms for the fightagainst hunger and extreme poverty. That task requiresgreater intellectual resources and technical expertiseand a new and fair financial architecture  not theaccumulation of wealth  worship of the market or thepromotion of globalization that does not allow the justdistribution of the wealth produced by all of usthroughout the world. We need a new financialarchitecture that enables us to reduce poverty and towork for the stability of the worldís emergingdemocracies.One year ago  my Government inherited asituation characterized by economic stagnation recession and spreading poverty and by weak andunreliable public institutions  resulting in timid socialpolicies that could hardly tackle the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.Two major challenges face my country. First  theindigenous population - which in Paraguay is notlarge  totalling no more than 100 000 - lacks access toits most vital needs and faces the disintegration ofmuch of its natural lands owing to the historical rule ofindolent landowners  and most recently to a type ofagrarian modernization that was insensitive to humandignity.Secondly  the unconscionable face of extremepoverty in my country is that of the peasants. Today two out of three Paraguayans continue to belong to thatsocial sector. Likewise  one of the most significantcauses of that critical national problem is the veryunjust distribution of land that has existed for manyyears in Paraguay. That is not only an urgent and veryshocking social problem  but also a political andethical problem that is manifested in a repeated andincreasingly grave struggle for land.In the light of that situation  we propose a Statewith social  fiscal and environmental responsibility:social responsibility in the sense of guaranteeinghealth  education and basic services and avoidingconcentration of profit and wealth; fiscal responsibilityto avoid a deficit and chronic indebtedness  whichultimately punish social investment; and environmentalresponsibility to preserve natureís reproductivecapacity and to ensure for future generations the rightto enjoy resources not created by man.We also propose the implementation of a nationalanti-poverty strategy that will channel the domestic andexternal resources necessary to meet the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. The national Government hasdefined as a top budget priority an increase in socialspending to resolutely address the problems of poverty destitution and inequality  with the objective ofreaching 40 per cent of the central administrationístotal public spending for next year  2005.For development  cooperation is not enough;there must also be access to markets on preferentialterms  liberalization of the agricultural product marketsand special treatment for the landlocked leastdeveloped countries  such as Paraguay  punished byhistory and geopolitics  which make our foreign trademore expensive and significantly reduce ourcompetitiveness. There needs to be a compensatoryframework to place my country  Paraguay  on an equalfooting with other nations in terms of internationaltrade.In the international context  we join in the appealfor a more just and humanized international order inwhich the least developed are not always condemned todiscrimination  indifference and backwardness. Withthat objective  we must move towards an inclusivemultilateralism that will offer equality  rationality andjustice in international relations.Similarly ó and in keeping with Paraguayísposition on Taiwan in the United Nations ó we oncemore reaffirm our conviction that the brotherlyRepublic of China  Taiwan  should become a full-fledged Member of the Organization  in accordancewith the principle of universality and with norms ofinternational law.Today we have heard more of the same things wehear every year in the Assembly. But we hope that thistime we can return to our countries and share with ourpeoples the news that finally  in New York  the worldísleaders have taken important steps forward inalleviating - even if just a little - the pain  sorrowand hopelessness of the millions of human beings wholive on Earth. I am confident that God will give us thewisdom and the strength necessary to lead ourcountries on the path of freedom  peace  developmentand justice."
"144",5830,"PSE",59,2004,"Let me begin bycongratulating you  Mr. Ping  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly during its fifty-ninth session. We are confident that you will conductthe proceedings of this session with great competence.I would like to pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Julian Robert Hunte  who so ably presided over thefifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.I would like to express at this time my deepappreciation for the efforts of the Secretary-General toharmonize international relations and ensure respectfor the principles of the Charter and international law with a view to strengthening international peace andsecurity. His statement before this Assembly marks a26landmark in the quest for the rule of law and respectfor the role of the United Nations in internationalconflicts.In my statement  I will focus on the turbulentsituation in the Middle East and  more specifically  onthe core of the conflict in the Middle East. Thesituation in the region of Western Asia — or theMiddle East — is in turmoil. The occupation of Iraqwas founded on false pretexts  further damaging thealready grave situation resulting from Israel’s policiesand practices in occupied Palestinian and other Arabterritories. A total absence of law and order is now thegeneral pattern of life in occupied Iraq. This continuedoccupation is wreaking havoc on the economic andsocial aspects of life there. We urge the competentinstitutions  namely the United Nations GeneralAssembly and the Security Council  to take thenecessary and appropriate measures to ensure Iraq’sindependence and sovereignty as soon as possible.Israel is the only nuclear Power in the MiddleEast. It has approximately the fourth most powerfularmy in the world and is a sophisticated armsdeveloper and dealer with no ethical or moralconstraints and no concern for human rights. TheIsraeli Government can therefore do anything itwishes  and it acts like a high-tech military expert androgue State. It has become tremendously useful for theUnited States  since it has strategically placed itself inthe centre of the global arms industry. Counting on thesupport of the United States  Israel breaks moral andinternational laws with impunity.The daily assaults on peaceful Palestinian townsand villages — the demolition of homes and houses the bulldozing and uprooting of age-old fruit-bearingolive and citrus trees  the targeted killings andassassinations  the closures  the imposition of a state ofsiege and curfews and the use of excessivelydisproportionate firepower  which has resulted  so far in more than 3 200 deaths and thousands of injuries —are common knowledge. We completely reject theallegation by Israel that this is carried out in self-defence. The Palestinians under occupation  with theirmeagre means of combat  are the party exercising theright to self-defence. Almost 8 000 Palestinians arebeing held without trial under merciless conditions and when they protested against those conditions  anIsraeli minister boasted  and I quote  “let them go on ahunger strike until they die”.In addition to all the other methods Israel uses toobstruct peace  it holds our democratically electedPresident  Yasser Arafat  in confinement and hasannounced that they can find no partner with whom tonegotiate peace. With whom are the negotiations forsettlement and peace to be negotiated  if not with thedemocratically elected President? Israel  and others ofthe same mind  must wish to see a continuation of thestatus quo or to deal with an imposed — and notdemocratically elected — group or person.The performance-based road map wasunanimously backed by Security Council resolution1515 (2003). We have accepted the road map since  inour opinion  it augured well. The road map envisaged atwo-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and stated that the solution of the conflict“will only be achieved through an end to violenceand terrorism  when the Palestinian people have aleadership acting decisively against terror andwilling and able to build a practising democracybased on tolerance and liberty  and throughIsrael’s readiness to do what is necessary for ademocratic Palestinian state to be established”.The Palestinians  through their representative  thePalestine Liberation Organization  embraced the roadmap and believes it offers another opportunity to endthe conflict. We hope that the Quartet will seriouslyassume the noble task of implementing the objectivesof the road map.Acts of State terrorism were Israel’s response tothe performance-based road map. To be more specific a 2 000-pound bomb was dropped after the Palestiniansscrupulously observed an unofficial ceasefire. Israelstill adheres to the 14 reservations it had regarding theroad map. The nebulous ideas and intentions revealedin the exchange of letters between President Bush andPrime Minister Sharon on the matter of thecommitment to the road map are far from encouragingand keep the road map and Security Council resolution1515 (2003) in limbo if not completely neglecting andrejecting them.In his letter of assurance dated 14 April 2004 toPrime Minister Sharon  President Bush reiterates that“the United States supports the establishment of aPalestinian state that is viable  contiguous sovereign  and independent  so that thePalestinian people can build their own future in27accordance with … the path set forth in theroadmap”.However  when President Bush addresses thereality on the ground  he assures Israel that “it isunrealistic to expect that the outcome of final statusnegotiations will be a full and complete return to thearmistice lines of 1949”.He admits that as part of a final peace settlement Israel must have secure and recognized borders  whichshould emerge from negotiations between the parties inaccordance with United Nations Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). However Mr. Bush and Mr. Sharon do not topographicallyidentify the secure and recognized borders of Israel.In the aforementioned letter of assurance President Bush stresses that the United States isstrongly committed to Israel’s security and well-beingas a Jewish State. He does not concern himself with thesecurity of the so-called provisional State of Palestine.He seems to be oblivious to the fact that 20 per cent ofthe citizens of Israel are non-Jewish and that Israel hasnot as yet defined who is a Jew. This concept willinevitably lead to the creation of a racist society withinthe Israeli political entity.To ensure the success of the road map and theachievement of its goal — a final and comprehensivesettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by 2005 —the plan also requires that Israel “freezes all settlementactivity” and “withdraws from Palestinian areasoccupied from 28 September 2000”.Commenting on the meeting betweenPresident Bush and Prime Minister Sharon Javier Solana  European Union High Representative forthe Common Foreign and Security Policy  stated on15 April 2004:“The EU remains firmly committed to anegotiated settlement resulting in two viable sovereign and independent States … as the onlyway to achieve a permanent peace and an end tothe occupation that began in 1967  in theframework of a comprehensive peace in theMiddle East.“EU heads of State or Government recentlyindicated that they would not recognize anychange to the pre-1967 borders other than thosearrived at by agreement between the parties. Apermanent settlement must also include anagreed  just  fair and realistic solution to therefugee issue”.In order further to deviate from the direct route tothe targeted destination  Sharon declared that he wasabsolutely determined to carry out disengagement inGaza despite the political problems within his ownparty  the Likud. Indeed  the party believes thatdisengagement conflicts with the Zionist aim of thecreeping annexation of Palestinian territory. Sharon’splan creates a situation in which Israel will have toleave the settlements but will still control everythingthat enters and exits Gaza. It will tightly seal off Gazaand block the only outlet that allows Palestinians inGaza to cross into and from neighbouring Egypt.All of this is a source of concern for theinternational community  as reflected in the number ofmeetings held by the General Assembly. Israel did notheed the request by the Assembly in resolutionES-10/14  which  by necessity  called for an advisoryopinion by the International Court of Justice on thefollowing question:“What are the legal consequences arisingfrom the construction of the wall being built byIsrael  the occupying Power  in the occupiedPalestinian territory  including in and around EastJerusalem  as described in the report of theSecretary-General  considering the rules andprinciples of international law  including theFourth Geneva Convention of 1949  and relevantSecurity Council and General Assemblyresolutions?”The General Assembly  by an overwhelmingmajority of 150 votes  acknowledged the Court’sadvisory opinion of 9 July 2004. The representatives ofthe Governments of the United States of America andof Israel were among the six countries that votedagainst.I wish to avail myself of this opportunity toexpress our great appreciation for the learned opinionof the judges. I wish to quote from the opinion  as it isof direct relevance to the General Assembly:“All States are under an obligation not torecognize the illegal situation resulting from theconstruction of the wall and not to render aid orassistance in maintaining the situation created bysuch construction;28“… The United Nations  and especially theGeneral Assembly and the Security Council should consider what further action is required tobring to an end the illegal situation resulting fromthe construction of the wall and the associatedregime  taking due account of the presentadvisory opinion.”In order to restore faith and confidence in theeffectiveness of the United Nations and its Charter  Iwould appeal that the opinion of the Court be heededand that action-oriented resolutions  including concretemechanisms for implementation  be adopted andcarried out.The Palestinian people and leadership havedemonstrated goodwill and accepted in good faith theprovisions of the road map and other proposals leadingto the termination of the Israeli occupation of ourPalestinian territory  so that we in the Middle East canall live in peace and security and stability. What isneeded is for the other party  Israel  to commit itself torespond  in word and in deed."
"145",5876,"QAT",59,2004,"It gives megreat pleasure to address the General Assembly onbehalf of the Group of 77 and China  currently chairedby my country  Qatar. I would like to seize thisopportunity to extend congratulations to Mr. Jean Pingon his assumption of the presidency of the currentsession of the General Assembly  wishing HisExcellency every success in the discharge of hisfunctions. I would also like to extend thanks to hispredecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  for guiding the work ofthe previous session.It also gives me pleasure to express myappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  theSecretary-General of the United Nations  for hisjudicious conduct of the work of this Organizationduring a critical period in which international relationshave faced and are still facing immense challenges.The United Nations was established six decadesago as an expression of the aspirations of all themembers of the international community to save theworld from the scourge of war  to maintaininternational peace and security  and to achievecooperation among nations and people in variousfields. Roughly two decades after its inception  on15 June 1964  to be exact  the Group of 77 wasestablished to express the aspirations of scores ofdeveloping countries in Asia  Africa and Latin Americato work with each other under the umbrella of theUnited Nations  with a view to promoting theircommon economic interests  developing theirnegotiating capacity regarding various internationaleconomic issues and increasing the bonds of theirtechnical cooperation.Just as the United Nations has grown  itsmembership has increased and the scope of its activityhas expanded  so  too  the Group of 77 and China hasattracted new members into its membership — whichnow stands at 132 States  constituting more than twothirds of the membership of the United Nations.Our Group embodies the commitment of thedeveloping countries to the mission of the UnitedNations and their determination to be guided by thelofty principles enshrined in its Charter. While theministerial meetings of the Group highlight withutmost certainty its close relationship with theinternational organizations  the actions of its Statessince April 2000  when it convened its first meeting atthe level of presidents and heads of Government reaffirm the interest of its members in promotingcoordination among themselves  inspired by theprinciples of the United Nations to achieve their aims.In the view of the Group of 77 and China  thedifficult challenge facing the international communitytoday is that of maintaining international peace andsecurity while achieving economic welfare anddevelopment. The history of international relationsover the second half of the last century has shown thatit is almost impossible to maintain peace and securityas long as people lack the minimum requirements for abasic dignified livelihood. Poverty and destitution haveoften resulted in tensions that have led to breaches ofinternational peace and security  and it is nocoincidence that the poorest regions in the world arethe ones that have suffered the most complicatedregional conflicts.To achieve the aims of security and developmentsimultaneously  the international community needs toadopt more equitable policies that do justice to a largesegment of the members of the internationalcommunity who still lack many of the basic necessitiesof life.It is indisputable that globalization has acquiredan immense momentum and yielded positive results.Nevertheless  it has been accompanied by someadverse effects as well  and a review andreconsideration of a number of current internationaleconomic policies is needed before globalization canacquire the human face it is supposed to have.The continued imbalance in the distribution of thebenefits of international economic interdependence  theprogressive widening of the gap between the developedand the developing countries  and the deterioration ofthe economic conditions in quite a few countries of theSouth  with the attendant adverse effects on theenvironment  will accentuate feelings of discontent andfrustration and could even lead to abhorrent forms ofinternational conflict.Accordingly  it is necessary to eliminate theobstacles that make it difficult for developing countriesto reap the fruits of world economic growth  and theinternational community must reaffirm its commitmentto the eradication of poverty and the achievement ofthe Millennium Development Goals through a deeperand more comprehensive integration of the developingcountries in the world economy.13The Group of 77 and China urgently calls for theestablishment of an open multilateral trading system one which takes into account the norms of justice andthe rule of law and is geared to assisting developingcountries combat poverty and underdevelopment. Sucha system requires the elimination of bias in theliberalization of trade between the developed and thedeveloping countries and the discontinuation ofpractices that continue to impede freedom ofcommerce  such as recourse to agricultural subsidies support for certain products and restrictions on themovement of individuals  which make it impossible fordeveloping countries to tap their potential or marketmany of their products.In this regard we call on the developed countriesto liberalize trade at a faster rate by removing thevarious obstacles that have so far deprived thedeveloping countries of their right to enjoyinternational trade relations based on equalopportunity. While noting the progress achieved in theDoha negotiations on the question of agriculture  wesupport the access to the world market of otherproducts from developing countries and urge that thisissue should be accorded the priority it deserves.Moreover  there should be agreement on specificmeasures to ensure sufficient financial flows todeveloping countries  especially foreign directinvestment  to assist those countries in building theproduction capacity they need to compete in the worldmarket. We would also stress the importance ofenabling everyone to benefit from the achievements ofscience and technology and thereby to gain access tosources of knowledge and receive help in achievingdevelopment.A review of the implementation of theMillennium Declaration indicates that its objectivesrelating to the countries of Africa and the leastdeveloped countries have so far seemed unattainable.This is due in large measure to the failure of countriesto fulfil the commitments they so generously made atvarious United Nations conferences and summits. Asthe General Assembly is going to undertake the firstreview of the Millennium Declaration next year  weshould seize the opportunity of our meeting today torenew our commitment to the prompt implementationof the Declaration. At the 2005 review of theDeclaration  the Group of 77 and China will present aseries of implementing proposals  most of which focuson the development of multilateral internationalrelations  with particular emphasis on the situation inAfrica  the least developed countries and thelandlocked developing countries. We have participatedactively in seeking practical solutions to the problemsbesetting those regions and will participate in theforthcoming review of the Barbados Programme ofAction for the Sustainable Development of SmallIsland Developing States early in 2005. I take thisopportunity to urge the international community tosupport the Barbados Programme of Action  as it is anintegral part of our efforts to move towards a betterworld.Allow me now to address  on behalf of mycountry  Qatar  a number of political issues closelyrelated to our aim of enabling the developing countriesand peoples to enjoy their full economic rights. Inparticular  I wish to single out the absence ofdemocracy and the prolonged slackening of politicalreform evident in a number of countries of the South and probably most apparent in the past few years in theMiddle East  where they have been at the root of mostof the harsh social and economic suffering currentlyplaguing that region.Political reform and people’s participation indecision-making are no longer an option but havebecome a definite necessity. As the history ofeconomic relations has shown  the States that havemade the greatest economic achievements — whetherin the North or in the South — have been those whichwere most committed to the exercise of democracy.The few exceptions — States that have managed toimprove their economic performance without followingthe principles of democracy — have known limitedsuccess and have continued to be vulnerable to suddeneconomic upheavals.Just as international economic relations aredominated by the discourse on sustainabledevelopment  another discourse must be launched onwhat I would term “sustainable reform”. There is nolesson to be learned from the experience of thecountries of the South which undertake political reformone moment then regress the next or take one steptowards democracy to serve a selfish interest then taketwo steps backwards once that interest has beensatisfied. One must instead look for guidance to thelong history of development  which shows that thoseStates which succeed are those which realize that theireconomies must be based on efficiency and thatefficiency can be achieved  not by fiat and policies of14intimidation and confinement  but only by discussionof and participation in public affairs.The question of Palestine embodies the sufferingof a people deprived of both its political and itseconomic rights and struggling  despite its difficulties to remedy the situation. However  the Israelioccupation remains a crushing burden on the legitimatePalestinian dreams of freedom and development. Formore than 50 years  the question of Palestine has beenon the agenda of the General Assembly. Hence  theinternational community needs to listen to itsconscience and to reconsider its position  bearing inmind that this question despite its humanitarian natureand manifest legitimacy  has been allowed to festerfrom one century to the next  thus compounding thetragedy of the Palestinian people before the might ofthe Israeli occupation forces. Compelling Israel toimplement the resolutions of international legitimacy ismore than a mere duty  because such legitimacy mustnot be applied selectively. Also  Israel must fulfil thecommitments it has made  in accordance with theadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justiceissued on 9 July 2004 and later endorsed by theGeneral Assembly at its tenth emergency specialsession. This includes its commitment to the road map;halting the construction of the separation wall  whichhas harmed the Palestinian homeland and disruptedlivelihoods; and enabling the Palestinian people toexercise its right to self determination and to establishan independent State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as itscapital  that would coexist in security and peace withIsrael.Related to this is the need to achieve acomprehensive peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeliconflict on the basis of Israel’s withdrawal from all theterritories occupied in 1967  including the SyrianGolan and the Lebanese Shaba’a farms. In this regard we stress the need to transform the Middle East into azone free of weapons of mass destruction  without anyexception.As regards Iraq  it is our hope that SecurityCouncil resolution 1546 (2004) will help stabilize thesituation so as to allow the implementation of theresolution’s timetable regarding the holding of free democratic elections and the timely drafting of apermanent constitution as a prelude to theestablishment of an elected constitutional government.Also  we will spare no effort in supporting thereconstruction of Iraq  and we affirm our position ofprinciple regarding the need to safeguard itsindependence  sovereignty and territorial integrity andnon-interference in its internal affairs. We would alsolike to emphasize the central role of the United Nationsin Iraq.We note with satisfaction the commitment of theSudan to work closely with the internationalcommunity to resolve the conflict in the Darfur region.This makes it incumbent on the internationalcommunity to cooperate positively with the SudaneseGovernment  especially since it has initiated actions torestore the rule of law to mitigate the suffering of theinhabitants of that region. We also welcome theaccords that were signed to find a peaceful settlementto the problem of southern Sudan and urge theinternational community to support the efforts of theGovernment of the Sudan in this regard.These last issues which I have raised  althoughseemingly of a political nature related to chronicregional problems  mainly in the Middle East  are not in fact  far removed from the endeavours of the Groupof 77 and China to achieve a more equitableinternational order. The regional stability that is soughtin each of these cases will allow economicreconstruction on a sound basis in every instance.The Group of 77 has been striving for more than40 years on more than one front. While buildingbridges among developing counties  it has activelysought to reach out to the developed countries andconvince them that the interest of the internationaleconomic order lies in narrowing the gap  rather thanwidening it. Moreover  it will always remaincommitted to the principles of the United Nations mindful of the need for continuous coordination withits organs and bodies."
"146",5922,"ROU",59,2004,"Allow me atthe outset to join others who have warmlycongratulated you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this session. Iwish you every success in your important undertaking which will enjoy the full support of the Romaniandelegation.For some years now  this great worldwidegathering has opened in the wake of deadly terroristattacks that require us to respond as one to voice strongcondemnation of all terrorist acts and a commitment tocontributing ever more energetically to the affirmationof effective multilateralism that will make globalaction increasingly effectual.In that context  I cannot fail briefly to address theissue of the struggle against terrorism  which is moreurgent today than ever before. Since September 2001 the level of violence of acts of terrorism — perpetratedin the name of ideological  territorial  religious orethnic differences and incompatibilities — has risendramatically.At the same time  the very nature of terrorist actshas changed. The complexity and scale of suchbarbarism  claiming the lives of hundreds or eventhousands of innocent victims — often children  as inthe recent incident in Beslan — are indescribably grimand represent immense challenges. Yet another factoris at play in all this: the increase in the number ofterrorist acts. In such conditions  the struggle againstthat scourge — whose implications are not onlyimmediate  but also complex and global in nature — isan urgent and ongoing obligation for all States.Romania promptly and meaningfully joined theanti-terrorism campaign and has demonstrated itsresolve to contribute to eradicating it. We believe however  that the struggle to end terrorism must alsoaddress its underlying causes  including poverty  andmust not be used as a pretext for flouting or violatinghuman rights. If that were to occur  we would beplaying into the hands of the perpetrators of terroristacts  who not only seek loss of life and devastation  butstrive above all to destroy symbols and values. On theother hand  promoting respect for human rights anddemocratic values is the only way to eliminate suchmanifestations of hatred and violence.The nature and  above all  the inherent dangers ofthe current international context make the developmentof cooperation among all kinds of international actors 2State and non-State alike  increasingly urgent. As anOrganization that is universal by vocation and inlegitimacy  the United Nations must fully assume itsrole as the driving force behind efforts to adapt tochanges in the international environment. In aninterdependent world  no single State is safe from suchdangers or from threats to international peace andsecurity  including terrorism  the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  the increasing number ofStates affected by instability  the growth of globaldisparities  humanitarian crises  ethnic wars and intra-State wars.Managing such risks requires a comprehensiveand coherent approach on the part of the UnitedNations  including through the promotion of preventivepolitical and diplomatic measures  such as thestrengthening of international treaties and conventionson combating terrorism and the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction; efforts to makeinternational export control regimes and specializedinternational structures more effective; and  in extremecases  recourse to coercive measures  in accordancewith the United Nations Charter.Our Organization has one strong and complextool at its disposal in meeting such challenges. I referto the Security Council  in which Romania is strivingto make a real contribution to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and the establishmentof a world climate of stability  with particular emphasison fighting terrorism  preventing conflicts andhumanitarian crisis situations  maintaining the unity ofCouncil members and supporting consensus solutions and encouraging cooperation on stabilization betweenthe United Nations and regional organizations. Withrespect to that last issue  I would note that Romaniahas been and continues to be interested in cooperationbetween the global Organization and the regional andsubregional pillars. Given the current internationalcontext  that is of major importance.(spoke in English)The need to speed up the reform of the UnitedNations is more urgent than ever. The series ofchallenges  more or less new  that the Organization hasto face in the twenty-first century make its reform apriority if its structures and working methods are toadapt to the present realities. The terms of referencecontinue to be efficiency  adaptability and progress.Romania looks forward to the recommendations of theSecretary-General on the report of the eminent personsso that we may embrace  together with other States  acollective effort that cannot afford delay.We hope that the sixtieth anniversary of theOrganization’s establishment will mark significantprogress in the process of adapting the United Nationsto the new challenges  and especially the SecurityCouncil  the essential body in the management ofworld peace and stability. Our relation to that organ  asa non-permanent member  increases our conviction thata new configuration  closely reflecting current realitiesby increasing the number of permanent and non-permanent seats  will consolidate the representativeprofile of the Security Council and thus its authorityand efficiency.I cannot ignore another aspect of ourcontemporary world. Both a source of challenges and amost generous framework for opportunities  thephenomenon of globalization is unavoidable andaffects us all. Given its nature  the United Nations isideally placed to manage the phenomenon  particularlyby correcting its consequences.In that context  Romania fully embraces theGlobal Compact Initiative of our Secretary-General which needs support and strengthening. All MemberStates must promote regional and transcontinentalintegration as vehicles and instruments of a harnessedglobalization. In this case  the European Union standsas a success story  since it acts as a vector not only ofeconomic integration  but also of democratic valuesand human rights. The United Nations has to try to findways to adjust the rules of the world market in order todiminish  in the medium and long terms  the big gapsthat exist between the rich countries and the poor.Another priority in our efforts to harnessglobalization is the need to enhance coordinationamong the specialized agencies and institutions of theUnited Nations system in their work to ensure thediffusion of information technology at a lower cost. Weneed to show more determination in our attempts todecrease the gaps in this field  and to guarantee theevolution of less developed countries from a state ofmarginalization to one catalysed by knowledge-baseddevelopment.Allow me to turn now to another essential factorfor a better future  one that Secretary-General KofiAnnan also underlined in his introductory speech —the rule of law. The validity of the principles of the3Charter of the United Nations have not only withstoodthe test of time  but they have also been reaffirmed bya whole new network of international agreements mandatory standards and norms of action to whichStates have voluntarily acceded  mechanisms for thepeaceful settlement of disputes and monitoringcommitments.As a proof of our faith in the international lawsystem  Romania appealed this year for the first time tothe International Court of Justice — the main judicialbody of the United Nations — to resolve a question ofmaritime delimitation. Romania also appealed to aninternational investigation commission to solve thecase of an infrastructure works project with cross-border impact on the Bistroe Channel in the DanubeDelta. Our appeal concerns the need for closecollaboration in order to protect a unique and fragileplace  a UNESCO world heritage site.Our efforts towards an effective multilateralismalso involve us in other major issues on the UnitedNations agenda. Romania has promptly joined  andsubstantially contributed to  international efforts for thestabilization and reconstruction of Afghanistan andIraq  in keeping with its long history of participation inUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and theprovision of assistance in post-conflict phases.The global vocation and aspirations of mycountry are closely related to its European destiny. Thefocus of Romanian diplomacy is therefore orientedtowards the democratic stabilization of ourneighbouring region and its effective connection to aunited Europe. For too long that region has beenaffected by wars and all kinds of tensions  often acuteones. Under such circumstances  Romania can onlysupport  alongside all of Europe  a boost to democracy economic development and a long-lasting stabilizationof the countries in the region.At the same time  Romania is ready to contributeto the stability and development of all countries in theBlack Sea region. We hope to turn this strategic area —with its close connections to other regions of immensepotential  including the Mediterranean Basin  theCaucasus  Central Asia and the Middle East — into acooperation and security zone.I cannot conclude without making a briefreference to another theme to which Romania attachesparticular importance. My country strongly supportsconcerted action to prevent the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. In an internationalcontext that is often volatile and defined by a growingcomplexity and increased interdependence  we cannotignore the necessity for immediate action  using themeans offered by our global Organization  in particularthe Security Council Committee established pursuantto resolution 1540 (2004)."
"147",5968,"RUS",59,2004,"I am addressing the Assembly today at a mostdifficult time for our country  when tears are still beingshed by those who lost their children and loved onesduring the horrific terrorist attack in the Russian city ofBeslan. I would like from this rostrum to take thisopportunity to express once again my gratitude to allthose who have shown their solidarity with Russia inthese tragic days. Our special thanks go to the States andinternational organizations that extended their helpinghand to the victims and the bereaved families ó to allthose who have suffered from this outrage.I am also addressing the Assembly at a momentof truth  when there cannot possibly be any doubtwhatever remaining as to the true nature ofinternational terrorism and the challenge it has flungdown before the world community. With their actionsthroughout the world  the terrorists have once and forall placed themselves in opposition to civilizedmankind. In fact  having made the mass murder ofpeople an end in itself  they have knowingly violatedall norms of human morality.Russia has drawn harsh conclusions. They havebeen set forth in the 4 and 13 September addresses bythe President of the Russian Federation  Vladimir V.Putin. We will not allow anyone to encroach on thesovereignty of our State. We will resolutely strengthenthe unity of the country and its people in order tocounter terror and to guarantee a secure and decent lifefor our citizens in freedom and democracy.The measures announced by the RussianPresident to achieve these objectives will beimplemented on the basis of our countryísConstitution; and we will continue to defend ourlegitimate interests throughout the world  not throughconfrontation  but by means of equitable dialogue cooperation and partnership. Moreover  a readiness toengage in honest cooperation in fighting terrorismwithout double standards  is becoming one of the keycriteria in our relations with any and all States.We must enter into a qualitatively new and criticalstage in the activities of the anti-terrorist coalition. Themeeting of the Security Council of 1 Septemberdemonstrated the strong determination of theinternational community to continue its fight againstterrorism in a consistent way. It is important now totranslate this commitment into practical actions asquickly as possible.In the three years that have passed since theterrorist attacks in New York City and Washington  alot has been done to develop effective partnership inthis sphere. However  compared to the scale of thethreat  far from enough has been done. It is importantto learn lessons from the experience gained and todraw conclusions for the future.First  the global nature of the terrorist threat testifiesto the fact that security in todayís world is indivisible.Consequently  only collective responsibility can makethe world secure. The fight against terrorism shouldunite States rather than pit them against each other. Wecan deal with this evil only on a multilateral basis bycombining our efforts and acting in the spirit of solidarity.As President Putin has declared  Russia considers theobjective of strengthening the anti-terrorist coalition tobe one of our most important tasks.A special emphasis here should be placed onintensifying the cooperation among our special services which  we are convinced  must now be raised to aqualitatively new level of trust and coordinated action.Secondly  a clear strategy and a generallyacceptable legal framework are the prerequisites forsuccess in combating terrorism. Such a framework isenshrined in resolution 1373 (2001) and in otherdecisions of the Security Council. But now  additionalefforts are needed. They include making necessaryamendments to national legislation  acceding tointernational anti-terrorist conventions and finalizingnew international counter-terrorism legal instruments.In circumstances where international terrorismhas declared war on our entire civilization  thedetermination of States to use their right of self-defence in conformity with Article 51 of the UnitedNations Charter is of particular importance. Of courseinternational law is clearly not an inalterable dogma.The fight against terrorism calls for its developmentand improvement.Thirdly  the time has come to renounce doublestandards once and for all when it comes to terror regardless of the slogans in which it may be cloaked.31Those who slaughtered children in Beslan and hijackedaeroplanes to attack America are creatures of the sameilk.Harbouring terrorists  their henchmen and theirsponsors undermines unity and mutual trust amongthose that form part of the anti-terrorist front  serves asjustification for the actions of terrorists and indeedencourages them to commit similar crimes in othercountries. I would recall that United Nations decisionsrequire States granting political asylum to carefullyexamine the personal records of each individual tomake sure that he or she has no links to terrorism.Attempts to use the fight against terrorism in variousgeopolitical games are even more counterproductiveand dangerous.Fourth  the utter atrociousness of the recentterrorist attacks proves there is the need for reliablesafeguards against terrorists gaining access to weaponsof mass destruction. Russia is prepared for the closestkind of international partnership in that area. Ourcountry was one of the sponsors of Security Councilresolution 1540 (2004). It is a participant in theProliferation Security Initiative and a co-sponsor of theGroup of Eight (G-8) Action Plan on Non-Proliferation. Those initiatives are complementary andare designed to increase the effectiveness of the regime ofthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction something which is especially relevant on the eve of the2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).Fifth  drug trafficking is increasingly interwovenwith terrorism. The drug flow from Afghanistan hasacquired global significance. The implementation of aset of social  economic and law-enforcement measuresboth within and outside the borders of that country isnow more urgent than ever. One of the key elements ofthat strategy lies in strengthening the existing anti-drugsecurity belts and creating new ones.Russia is making an important contributiontowards resolving the drug problem  including throughthe formulation of specific legal  political andoperational measures within the framework of theShanghai Cooperation Organization and the CollectiveSecurity Treaty Organization (CSTO). We are ready tocoordinate actions with the Government ofAfghanistan  and with the multinational and coalitionforces operating in that country.Sixth  international terrorists have neithernationality nor religion. In fact  it is specificallyreligion and national culture that  today as neverbefore  require protection from the devastating impactof extremism of any kind. There is a need forrespectful dialogue among various religions andcivilizations. Russia  which is open both to the Westand to the East  is ready to play its part in that process which is intended to prevent a split in civilization.Another pressing task today is the saving ofworld spiritual and cultural monuments from attacks byextremists. We deem it essential to establishcooperation in that area between the United Nationsand its specialized agencies  primarily the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO). Failing to act here ó as wellas standing by in silence at the desecration ofmemorials to Second World War heroes and victimsand at attempts to rehabilitate fascists ó can only playinto the hands of those who wish to incite extremisttrends in society.Seventh  Russia believes that the United Nationsmust continue to play a pivotal role in uniting theefforts of the international community in its fightagainst terrorism. As Chair of the Security CouncilísCounter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)  our countryintends to actively contribute to speeding up the reformof that Committee. We propose drafting a new SecurityCouncil resolution that would ensure the most effectivepossible functioning of the CTC  so as to identify  in atimely manner  weak links in the anti-terrorismnetwork and increase practical cooperation between theCTC and international and regional organizations including the Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS)  the CSTO and the Shanghai CooperationOrganization.The CIS summit held recently in Astana Kazakhstan  reaffirmed the strong potential of CISregional structures in all areas  from anti-terroristactivities and ensuring collective security tointensifying economic integration.Certainly  in an increasingly interdependentworld  the war on terrorism cannot be considered inisolation from other pressing issues facing mankind.This is especially relevant to the settlement ofconflicts  which for decades have been destabilizingthe situation at the regional and global levels. Throughits decisions  the General Assembly must promote a32Middle East settlement on the basis of commitmentsmade by the parties under the road map. Yesterday  theQuartet of international mediators spoke out to that end.The situation in Iraq is a source of seriousconcern. Russia is ready to render all possibleassistance towards attaining a political settlementaimed at preserving Iraqís territorial integrity andensuring its political sovereignty and a genuinelydemocratic post-war recovery. The search for nationalreconciliation within Iraq is of key significance; here the Iraqis could be assisted by the holding of aninternational conference with the participation of allmajor Iraqi political forces  friendly States  SecurityCouncil members and the League of Arab States andother organizations.We must remain vigilant with regard to Kosovo which is a dangerous hotbed of tension. There is noroom for complacency. We must work to ensure thatuniversally recognized standards of human rights andthe rights of national minorities are applied in theregion. We also need to make full use of existingmechanisms for conflict settlement within the CIS.Consolidating the peacemaking capacity of theinternational community is crucial to overcomingregional crises. A collective response to humanitariancrises  in particular those on the African continent  infull compliance with the United Nations Charter and ina spirit of partnership with regional structures  wouldleave no doubt that the Charter remains a universalbasis for the effective solution of such problems.The United Nations must continue to focus itsattention on other global threats to security andsustainable development as well. Those include theeradication of poverty and illiteracy as a breedingground for extremism. Annually  our country grants1 000 scholarships to students from African countries.Russia has contributed $7.5 million to the Global Fundto Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria and hasprovided bilateral humanitarian assistance to a numberof African countries.Among the challenges and threats is that offinding ways to bridge the gap between poor and richStates. Russia has been making its contribution there;between 1998 and 2002 it wrote off the debt of Africancountries equivalent to $11.2 billion.Another challenge is ensuring environmentalsecurity. Here I would like to confirm that inaccordance with the decision of President Vladimir V.Putin we are now engaged in serious consideration ofratification of the Kyoto Protocol.The challenges also include preventing thetransformation of outer space into a theatre of armedconfrontation. Together with China  we are calling for theconclusion of a comprehensive agreement to that end. Wecall upon all countries with space capability to join in thatinitiative. There is also a growing need to elaborate aUnited Nations convention on outer space law.A further challenge is the fight against grossviolations of human rights  with a view to ensuring thesecurity and dignity of the individual. The UnitedNations  the Organization for Security and Cooperationin Europe  the Council of Europe and otherorganizations should not remain passive spectatorswhen  in some countries  a considerable part of thepopulation is deprived of citizenship and consequentlyof basic political  social and economic rights.On Russiaís initiative  the General Assembly  atits fifty-seventh and fifty-eighth sessions  adoptedresolutions 57/145 and 58/16 respectively  onestablishing  under the aegis of the United Nations  acomprehensive approach to countering new threats andchallenges. The resolutions contain specific guidelinesfor bringing the international community closer to anew security model that would meet the globalchallenges of the twenty-first century.Those are the lines along which the High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change  establishedby the Secretary-General  is organizing its work. Wehope that its recommendations will pave the way for agenuine enhancement of the effectiveness of the UnitedNations. At the same time  reform of the Organization and particularly of the Security Council  should bebased on the broadest possible agreement and shouldnot provoke the alienation of States.The international community is undergoing acomplex period in its establishment of a new system ofinternational relations. It is already clear that this willbe a long-term process with an uncertain future andone that  so far  is difficult to predict. At the same time there is an enormous increase in the number of newunresolved problems and new dangerous challenges tosecurity and the development of mankind. We still lacka collective strategy and universally applicablemechanisms for responding to those challenges. In fact 33we have to constantly improvise and use makeshiftmeans to ensure world stability.A question arises as to whether we could soonfind ourselves in a situation in which events start to goout of control. Is it not time for the internationalcommunity to assume an active role in impacting uponglobal processes and taking targeted actions toestablish a more secure and just world order? Russia isfully determined  together with other countries  tobuild such a world order and take its proper placetherein as a free and democratic State.More than half a century ago  the civilized worldput aside all its disputes and differences and mobilizedits efforts to counter the deadly threat of Nazienslavement. The enemy that opposes us today is noless dangerous and no less merciless. Russia sincerelyhopes that the forthcoming sixtieth anniversary of theend of World War II and the establishment of theUnited Nations will become a historic milestone on thepath to a world order in which the twenty-first centurysees the noble principles of peace  stability anddevelopment enshrined in the United Nations Charterhold sway."
"148",6015,"RWA",59,2004,"Allowme at the outset to convey to the President myGovernment's congratulations on his election topreside over the fifty-ninth session of the GeneralAssembly.We have no doubt that his wisdom and experiencewill be of great service to the Organization at a timewhen it must make important decisions  in particularconcerning the reform of the Security Council. He willsurely do honour to all Africa.I also take this occasion to express our gratitudeand congratulations to Mr. Julian Hunte for theexcellent quality of his presidency at the fifty-eighthsession of the General Assembly.In April this year  the whole world joinedRwanda in our observance of the tenth anniversary of44the 1994 genocide  in which more than a million of ourcitizens - men  women and children - weremassacred by the former Government  whichinstitutionalized hatred  discrimination andsectarianism.We thank in particular the General Assembly andthe Security Council for joining us in this Hall last7 April to pay tribute to the memory of the victims inRwanda and to renew our commitment to ensuring thatthe horrors of genocide do not occur again  in any partof the world.That tragedy of genocide and its manyconsequences obliged us in Rwanda to undertake thenational and collective duty of examining ourconscience. We believe we have learned so much insorrow from that task that we have undertaken concretemeasures in that respect.In the process  we created the National Unity andReconciliation Commission  which has led the nationaldialogue over the last five years. We have alsoundertaken vast reforms at all levels and in many areasof national life  which  among other things  enablepeople to develop initiatives and to participate indecisions affecting their own development. We havethus adopted a new constitution  which  for the firsttime in the history of our country  was conceived bythe people of Rwanda themselves and draftedaccording to the ideas  concerns  aspirations andpriorities of the people and not according to those ofso-called legal experts from other continents. This newconstitution guarantees the freedoms and fundamentalrights of the people  brings together universalprinciples and national realities  but also  and aboveall  offers measures to exclude once and for all fromour society the poor governance that led to thegenocide in 1994.We have carried out important legal reforms thathave indeed restored our judicial system. In the searchfor justice that will restore and reconcile our people we have introduced traditional participatoryjurisdiction - known as Gacaca - to judge thethousands of those presumed to be implicated in thecrimes committed during the genocide.We are also now transforming our economy byemphasizing innovation  competitiveness  the role ofnew information and communication technology andthe improvement of public services as the appropriateway to achieve economic growth and lasting nationaldevelopment. We have carried out other reforms in theareas of education  health  security and theadvancement of women in public administration tosuch an extent that today Rwanda leads the countrieshaving the largest number of women elected to nationaldecision-making posts.Rwanda is contributing  albeit modestly  to all thepeace processes underway in our region and other areasof Africa. In this context  my Government did nothesitate to respond to the appeal of the African Unionregarding Darfur and sent a military mission tocontribute to the efforts of the international communityand the Sudanese Government to restore peace to thissorely tested region of our dear continent.We feel that the international community alsoneeds to engage in some soul-searching in order toreflect on the lessons to be learned from the failures ofthe past and to re-examine its responses to crisissituations such as the genocide of 1994 in Rwanda. Weshould therefore ask ourselves if we really do have asystem of early warning in place to detect emergingcrises. Can we say that today  more than yesterday  wehave the political will necessary to respond decisivelyand appropriately around the world to these emergingcrises? Is the world's division into major Powers'zones of influence not continuing today ó just as it didin 1994 in Rwanda - to prevent the United Nationsfrom formulating just and effective responses to crisissituations?Every Member of this Assembly is certainlyaware of the magnitude and the frightening scope ofterrorism as well as the challenge it poses tointernational peace and security. Indeed  from theRussian Federation  through Spain  Indonesia  Kenyaand to the United States  terrorists are causingdevastation  even using innocent women and childrento achieve their unspeakable goals.The Great Lakes region in Africa is certainlyacquainted with terrorism. Indeed  the forces thatcommitted genocide in Rwanda  namely Rwandaísformer Forces armees rwandaises (ex-FAR) and theINTERAHAMWE continue to bring death anddevastation with unsurpassed cruelty to the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Burundi and Rwanda. You allcertainly know of their most recent and sinister deed carried out barely two months ago  when this samegroup  together with the Forces nationales de liberation(FNL) rebels of Burundi  attacked a refugee camp in45Banyamulenge in Gatumba  Burundi  and massacred160 innocent people ó men  women and children óbecause of their ethnic origin.The most incomprehensible and unacceptablething for us is the well-known fact that the bases of allthese groups are located in the east of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and that their leaders are well-known  but that no serious international action hasbeen undertaken  to date  to destroy these bases and toarrest their leaders. And yet  in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  almost in the very samelocation as these genocidal forces  there is a well-armed United Nations force  which is costing theinternational community a mere $700 million per year.We need to seriously ask ourselves whether theinternational community has learned any lessons fromthe tragedy of Rwanda. In our humble view  the UnitedNations should assume its responsibilities and take thenecessary measures to disarm  demobilize andrepatriate the terrorist and genocidal groups in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  which continue todestroy with impunity entire communities in our regionand which have been the source of two wars in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  directly involvingup to eight African countries.My Government feels that  just as theinternational community has the responsibility orobligation to guarantee the protection of individuals inserious danger  it is also responsible for protecting andsupporting those who have escaped from thosesituations. It is in this context that  since 1994  theGovernment of Rwanda has reserved 5 per cent of itsannual budget for priority contributions to the healthcare and education needs of those who escaped thegenocide. In the same spirit  and during the currentsession of the Assembly  a draft resolution will besubmitted  requesting the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations to mobilize the entire United Nationssystem to give financial support to our domesticefforts  which remain  despite everything  insufficientwith regard to the real - if not vital - needsparticularly of the orphans  widows and victims ofsexual abuse. We hope that it will receive your support.My Government has followed with great interestthe current discussions regarding reform in the SecurityCouncil. Rwanda  which has been the subject of debatealmost continuously in the Council for 14 years  ismore sensitive than many other nations to the need tomake this powerful body of our Organization morerepresentative and democratic. We feel  in particular that it is high time to end the marginalization of thecontinents of Africa and Latin America by grantingthem permanent seats in the Security Council.While emphasis is quite rightly being given to theexpansion of the Council and regional representation we firmly believe that equal attention should bedevoted to improving the Council's methods of workand that emphasis should be placed on theirtransparency. We hope that this aspect will be takeninto account by all the parties concerned; otherwise this reform will be cut short and will not have any realimpact. In particular  we are deeply concerned that anunwritten rule  nowhere to be found in print  seems tohave reserved the initiative for making proposals onlyto the permanent members of the Security Council.Even more worrying is the apparent division of theworld into spheres of influence  with each permanentmember having the almost absolute and exclusive rightto propose draft resolutions and presidential statementsrelating to its own zone of influence. This situationdoes no credit to the Organization and seriouslyundermines the credibility of the Security Council andits decisions.My Government has taken note of theimprovements which have been made towards greaterefficiency in the International Criminal Tribunal forRwanda  and encourages the Office of the Prosecutorand the Registry to pursue their efforts to end the wasteand corruption which have characterized the Tribunal.And it is from that standpoint that we guarantee ourfull support for the Tribunal in the implementation ofits completion strategy. We are awaiting the upcomingconclusion of agreements regarding the transfer ofcertain accused to be tried  as well as some who havealready been convicted and who will serve theirsentences in Rwanda  which we feel is a token of trustand of restored cooperation.In conclusion  for us  support for economicdevelopment remains one of the greatest raisons díÍtreof the Organization. As I speak  as members know hundreds of thousands of people in Africa are facinghunger  poverty and disease and are living in greatdespair. The United Nations  therefore  needs tomobilize  concentrate and guide all our collectiveefforts to attain the Millennium Development Goalsand to pull the African continent out of its currentpolitical and economic difficulties. Here  the New46Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is akind of reassuring road map and framework  that ishelping us to bring about the rebirth and prosperity ofAfrica.Thus  this universal family of nations shouldreject the current situation with half of us living inaffluence  prosperity and good health  while the otherhalf is dying of hunger and disease  which all of ustogether can prevent and eradicate. Let us  therefore work all together to change this situation."
"149",6058,"SAU",59,2004,"Iam pleased to express to you  Sir  and to your friendlycountry  Gabon  our sincere congratulations on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-ninth session. We are confident that you will leadthe work of this session in a highly capable andefficient manner. I should also like to express ourappreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia  who  asPresident of the last session of the Assembly  managedits affairs with wisdom and skill.On this occasion  I should like to convey the deepappreciation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia toHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his sustained diligent and commendable efforts to maintaininternational peace and security and to revitalize therole of the United Nations and enhance its functions capacities  credibility and effectiveness. In that regard the speech given by the Secretary-General last week isnotable and praiseworthy  as it provided a blueprint andguidelines for enhancing the resiliency of theinternational order. It is crucial when tackling globalissues to bridge the gaps in the international order sothat measures are not applied selectively or arbitrarily.The accelerating global changes and the gravechallenges facing the international community todaynecessitate more than ever a scrutiny of the workingmethods of the United Nations  as well as thestructures and functions of its organs  in order toenhance its ability to prevent and resolve conflicts andto maintain international peace and security.In that respect  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabiasupports the call for reform of the Security Council  inparticular  an increase in its membership in order toimprove geographical representation  a greatertransparency in its work  a halt to the application ofdouble standards and the adoption of measures thatwill enhance the credibility of the Council’s work andguarantee respect for  and compliance with  itsresolutions.Among the important reforms needed in ourOrganization is restriction of the veto power.Permanent members of the Security Council should notbe allowed to invoke their right of veto in cases whereproposed resolutions and procedures are adopted toimplement previously agreed resolutions.It is also imperative to establish an optimalbalance between the General Assembly and theSecurity Council  to enhance the role of the Economicand Social Council and to establish closer coordination18among the various United Nations funds  programmesand activities.We reaffirm our commitment to the UnitedNations and the multilateral international order. Today more than ever  the international community is in direneed of a unified and mutually supportive stance inorder to achieve just solutions to the current problemswe all face. It is through respect for the shared values traditions and principles that are deeply rooted in theconscience of all mankind that we can promoteconstructive cooperation and the achievement ofsecurity  peace  stability and prosperity for all nations.Humanity has been afflicted by the growingdanger of terrorism. It is a phenomenon that does notdifferentiate between societies. Increasingly  terroristgroups have been crossing borders and expanding theirnetworks into different regions  nations and continents.Today  it is therefore critical that we exert every effortpossible to increase international cooperation tocombat terrorism and confront those who instigate andfinance it.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia rejects terrorism inall its forms and manifestations and is cooperating withthe international community to eliminate that globalevil. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has affirmed its fullsupport for the Security Council resolutions relating toterrorism. In that regard  Saudi Arabia has taken thenecessary steps to close any loopholes in its domesticregulations on charitable fund-raising activities thatmight allow such funds to be used for illicit purposes.We have established a public commission tasked withsupervising and organizing the activities of allcharitable and relief organizations with a view tostreamlining their operations and preventing those withbad intentions and evil objectives from using theirhumanitarian funds for illegal purposes.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was among thefirst signatories of the Arab Convention on theSuppression of Terrorism and other similar agreementsemanating from the Organization of the IslamicConference and the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council. Inaddition  it has acceded to nine other international anti-terrorism conventions and agreements. In that regard the Government of Saudi Arabia has recently taken aseries of measures that are indicative of its seriousnessand determination to fight terrorism. Its strategy ofpreventive action to forestall criminal acts has alreadybeen successful in the fight against this deadly scourgeand has earned the praise and admiration of theinternational community and internationalorganizations.It is important to remember that crimescommitted by a handful of criminals and misguidedfelons cannot justify incriminating a whole society oran entire culture. Terrorism can strike any city andtarget any interests  regardless of the nationality religion or ethnic origin of the victims. Terrorism is aglobal phenomenon that calls for joint action andcooperation by all countries and requires the closecollaboration of concerned international organizationsto effectively find the means to confront it andeliminate it.It is on the basis of the foregoing that I ampleased to announce before this gathering that theGovernment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hasdecided to host an international conference to combatterrorism  to be held in Riyadh from 5 to 8 February2005. Its purpose is to exchange information andexperience in the field of combating terrorism and tosee how we can cooperate with other countries in thefight against that universal threat. We also intend to usethis excellent opportunity to learn about scientific andpractical techniques relevant not only to combatingterrorism  but also to the prevention of money-laundering  drug trafficking and arms smuggling. Theconference will also provide a good forum in which tostudy the culture and psychology of terrorists and thestructure of terrorist organizations.Official invitations to the anti-terrorismconference have already been extended to concernedinternational organizations as well as to countries thathave suffered or are suffering from terrorism. TheKingdom of Saudi Arabia welcomes the participationof all those invited and hopes that the outcome andfinal recommendations of the conference willconstitute an important addition and a great support tointernational efforts to eradicate terrorism and addressthe root causes of that dangerous phenomenon.The setback in the peace process and themounting wave of violence and extremism in ourregion are largely attributable to the IsraeliGovernment’s pursuit of policies that are totallyincompatible with the fundamental principles of thepeace process  notably the principle of land for peace.Israel’s actions are in contravention of Security Councilresolutions — in particular  resolutions 242 (1967) and19338 (1973) — and the road map. They are incompatiblewith the United States Administration’s vision of twoStates — an Israeli State and an independentPalestinian State — living side by side.The Arab peace initiative continues to stand as acredible basis for the security and stability of all thepeoples of the region because it ensures a lasting  justand comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeliconflict. It is therefore incumbent upon all of us toexert our utmost efforts to put the peace process backon track. It is particularly important to push the peaceprocess forward after it has stalled and after thehumanitarian plight of the Palestinian people — whichshould be a goad to the conscience of the internationalcommunity — has been met with indifference.Furthermore  peace cannot be achieved byunilateral Israeli measures that create new realities onthe ground and that are designed to prejudice the finaloutcome of any political negotiations on the delicateissue of a final settlement. The Palestinian questioncannot be solved  nor can the Arab-Israeli conflict beended  through the use of excessive force — aerialbombardment  guided missiles  assassination ofPalestinian activists  destruction of infrastructure usurpation of property  violation of rights and theimposition of collective punishment. Peace will beachieved and security will prevail only when UnitedNations resolutions are implemented  the provisions ofinternational law are respected and applied and theprinciples of justice and equality are observed.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia condemns thecontinuous escalation against the Palestinian peopleand the Israeli Government’s insistence on establishingand expanding its settlements. We also condemn thecontinued construction of the separation wall that hasannexed extensive Palestinian lands in unprecedenteddefiance of the advisory opinion of the InternationalCourt of Justice  which acknowledged the illegality ofthe wall and ordered Israel to dismantle it  as well asthe General Assembly resolution that followed thatopinion  effectively demonstrating the consensus of theinternational community on the issue.However  if Israel is serious about withdrawingfrom Gaza and about dismantling its settlements there we stress that such an action should proceed incoordination with the Palestinian Authority  inconformity with the requirements of the road map andunder the supervision of the Quartet. The proposedwithdrawal should come about as a first step towards acomplete and full withdrawal from all the Palestinianlands  including Al-Quds.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is closelymonitoring efforts to eliminate all forms of weapons ofmass destruction from the Middle East and to keep itfree from all such lethal weapons. In that respect  wecall upon the international community to adopt aneven-handed approach  refrain from applying doublestandards  assume its legal and moral responsibilitiesand urge the Israeli Government to refrain from thedevelopment of its nuclear programmes  as well assubject its nuclear installations to the inspection andsafeguards regime of the International Atomic EnergyAgency.We are profoundly distressed and gravelyconcerned at the deteriorating security situation insome parts of Iraq  where tragic incidents  heinous actsof violence  and the horrific kidnapping of innocentpeople seem to be daily occurrences. Faced with thisappalling reality  we can only urge the Iraqi people andall Iraqi factions to mend fences and work hand inhand to support the efforts of their transitionalGovernment to establish the security  safety and well-being of their country; preserve its national unity andindependence and ensure the restoration of Iraq’seffective and positive role in the international arena.We also call upon the United Nations to play a greaterrole in assisting the Iraqi Government to meet therequirements of the ongoing political process including by conducting general elections  which wehope will lead to a permanent legitimate Government and proceeding with reconstruction efforts.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has presentedsome ideas regarding the deployment of Islamic troopsin Iraq. With the consent of the Iraqi Government andunder United Nations supervision  we would like suchtroops not to supplement  but to replace  themultilateral forces. Those ideas  however  have notmaterialized  although their basic premise deservesconsideration and follow-up.With respect to developments in the brotherlycountry of the Sudan  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia isprofoundly moved by the humanitarian tragedy inDarfur and supports the efforts of the Government ofthe Sudan to restore stability in that region. We supportthe Sudan’s cooperation with relief and humanitarianorganizations and others in addressing the20humanitarian situation resulting from the crisis. Wehope that the efforts of the Government of the Sudanand those of the African Union will be given sufficienttime to restore security to the region and to ensure thewell-being of its people.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has initiated anongoing airlift operation  using Saudi cargo planes  toprovide direct humanitarian assistance to the Darfurregion. This assistance includes medical and foodsupplies  tents and power generators. Moreover  thereare Saudi relief teams in the region who haveestablished clinics and hospitals inside camps andequipped them with doctors  medicine  medicalsupplies and tests. In addition  wells have been dug toprovide the camps with drinking water  and electricityis being supplied.Human development and economic prosperity aremajor keys to achieving a better future for developingcountries. To reach that objective  developed anddeveloping nations can work together to achieve greatsuccess. My country has contributed to this process byadopting and implementing numerous developmentprojects and by extending generous assistance todeveloping and least developed countries throughnational  regional and international agencies  in orderto help them in overcoming the problems of povertyand underdevelopment.We appreciate the concern expressed by theGroup of Eight at their summit in Sea Island  Georgia in the United States  regarding the future of the MiddleEast and their desire to help the countries of the regiondevelop and make progress. However  we believe thatpolitical and economic reforms should not be imposedor dictated from outside; rather  international assistancein this area should serve as a catalyst to help thesenations initiate their own reforms. Outside interferenceon the question of reform can only result in disruptingand stalling processes that are already under way.For reforms to be effective and lasting  theyshould reflect the actual needs of the societiesconcerned and should conform with a given State’sstage of development. Of course  there is much that theadvanced countries can do to help in this process especially in the areas of investment  tradeliberalization  international economic cooperation andthe opening of their markets. We believe that removingprotective measures  such as trade barriers and tariffs and eliminating preferential treatment that hinders theability of developing countries to enter the markets ofdeveloped countries can go far in achieving desireddevelopment goals. There is  moreover  a need to makethe necessary effort to help those countries toovercome their problems and their chronic politicalconflicts.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  based on itsposition of responsibility and its effective role in theinternational oil market  has consistently sought tomeet its obligations to maintain stable oil markets andensure continuing world economic growth. To that end it has increased its production capacity to ensuresufficient supply and to control unnatural oil pricesurges.In this regard  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia tookthe initiative of establishing the International EnergyForum and hosting its general secretariat in Riyadh.The Forum has become a platform for discussing waysand means of cooperation and dialogue betweenconsumer and producer countries  whether within oroutside the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC). Those countries should seek tointensify their cooperation in order to ensure stablemarkets for the strategic commodity of petroleum  andto guarantee the continued growth of the globaleconomy.In view of the tragic security events on theinternational scene  the world needs  more than ever concerted international efforts to increase dialogue andraise the level of understanding  mutual contact andfamiliarity among nations and cultures. The worldneeds to embark on a serious effort to propagate aculture of peace  in order to achieve for our fellowhuman beings the dignity and prosperity they deserve.We need to do more to put an end to the wave ofviolence and work for the achievement of justice andthe termination of racial discrimination.God Almighty said in the Holy Qur’an: “Omankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a maleand a female  And made you into Nations and tribes that ye may know each other. Verily the most honouredof you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the mostrighteous of you.”"
"150",6097,"SDN",59,2004,"It gives mepleasure to extend my delegationís sincere41congratulations to Mr. Jean Ping on his deservedelection to the presidency of the fifty-ninth session ofthe General Assembly. Given the issues that we mustconsider during this session  and in view of theimportant tasks we must face in the coming year  weparticularly welcome the Presidentís experience andskills  which are familiar to us in the African arena.We would also like to extend our thanks andappreciation to Mr. Julian R. Hunte  the outgoingPresident  for the great efforts he made in conductingthe work of the Assembly  as well as to the Secretary-General for leading the work of the Organization.Last year from this rostrum I stated thatnegotiations between the Government and the SudanPeopleís Liberation Movement/Army  under theauspices of the Intergovernmental Authority onDevelopment (IGAD) and Kenyaís chairmanship  andwith the support of the IGAD partners  had made greatprogress and peace had become imminent. I am glad tosay that the last round of negotiations resulted in thesigning  in the first week of June 2004  of six protocolsdealing with security arrangements  cessation ofhostilities  distribution of wealth  power-sharing andthe conflict in the Nubian mountains region  the BlueNile and Abiai. We decided to hold the last round ofnegotiations on 7 October 2004 to complete the detailsof a comprehensive peace  which will  it is hoped  besigned at the end of this year.We stand on the threshold of peace. The newchallenge before us now is to overcome the differencesof the past  start reconstruction and rehabilitation concentrate on development and strengthen the pillarsof peace and national unity on the basis ofcompatriotism and equality of rights and duties. Forthat reason  my Government declares its firm intentionof conducting a national dialogue with all politicalforces  inside and outside the Sudan  in order to makepeace a national objective that can be achieved througha national charter.It also gives me pleasure to say that in addition tothe talks in Naivasha and Abuja my Governmentstarted a third forum in Cairo  under the auspices of theEgyptian Government  to engage in dialogue withfactions of the national opposition  headquartered inAsmara.Because war has devastated all sectors of thecountry  reconstruction efforts are especially difficult.We would like to express our appreciation to theinternational community for the humanitarian assistancethey provided during the war. We now appeal to theinternational community to help in the reconstructionprocess: to ameliorate the living conditions in the areasdevastated by war all over the Sudan; to aid in theresettlement of internally displaced persons andrefugees; and to participate in development projects inorder to achieve peace and stability.We were at the threshold of peace in the southwhen another war broke out in Darfur as the result of arebel movement begun by some tribes and supportedby foreign forces. The rebel movementís terroristaction was not directed against the Government only but against those tribes that refused to join them. That in turn  pushed those tribes to train and arm militias todefend themselves against the rebels. The rebelmovement targeted the security apparatus  sowingdeath and destruction  which led to the release of criminalJanjaweed groups from prisons. The aggression continuedagainst civilians and Government institutions.The root causes of Darfur go back to conflictsamong the tribal communities in the region. Previously those conflicts were settled according to traditionalcustoms and norms. But the growth in population andthe number of livestock  coupled with a decrease in thewater supply owing to desertification  led to tensestruggles between grazing land tribes and farmers.There were other causes for regional conflict: an influxof arms and the interference of neighbouring countriesthat tried to exploit the tense situation  encouragingrebellions against the Government by training andarming certain groups.The present conflict in Darfur started in March2003  when rebels started inciting dissension and strife attacking highways  plundering livestock and takinginternational relief workers as hostages. TheGovernment tried to convince them to abandon militaryaction  but they insisted on occupying cities andvillages and terrorizing tribes  forcing them into armedservice. Everyone had to carry weapons for self-defence. Then  the Government intervened to try tohalt the hostilities  impose law and order and preventcivil war.This conflict  which was imposed on theGovernment  has created extremely complicated anddire humanitarian conditions. The Government took thenecessary measures. It sent food relief to Darfur. Next it eliminated all the administrative  legal and technical42arrangements that impeded relief work  it allowedrelief organizations to enter Darfur unimpeded  and itcurtailed certain regulations  such as visa requirements in order to provide protection to camps of displacedpersons. The Government deployed police andreopened legal offices destroyed by the rebels. Theprocess of bringing all of those accused of violatinghuman rights to justice began. Furthermore  theGovernment cooperated with the internationalcommunity by signing a joint communique with theSecretary-General that includes a number of measuresto deal with the situation in Darfur and  together withJan Pronk  Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Sudan  I headed a Joint ImplementationMechanism mission to the area.Furthermore  out of its belief in a peacefulsettlement as a strategic choice  the Governmententered into negotiations with the rebels under theauspices of the President of Chad  which culminated inthe Abashi agreement in 2003  but that agreement waslater violated by the rebels. However  this did notweaken the Governmentís resolve to continue itsefforts  until we attained the ceasefire agreement inNíDjamena. In order to cooperate with the AfricanUnion  we sent a high-level delegation to the firstround of negotiations at Addis Ababa; our delegationwas given full authority to reach a peaceful settlementwith the rebels. But the rebels boycotted the talks.The Government redoubled its efforts at alllevels - political  security and humanitarian - out ofits responsibility for the people  and it cooperated fullywith the United Nations so as to implement theagreement that had been reached with the Secretary-General. Then  on 30 July 2004  the Security Counciladopted resolution 1556 (2004)  which gave theGovernment only one month to deal with the problemand threatened the imposition of sanctions. It isregrettable that this resolution sent an erroneousmessage  thus encouraging the rebels to give upnegotiations with good intention. They insisted onconditions that were impossible to implement. And thisled to the collapse of negotiations in Addis Ababa  inspite of the African Unionís great efforts.Notwithstanding the faults and impracticality ofthis Security Council resolution  my Government abiding by its international legitimacy andresponsibility for its people  will continue to do itsutmost to find the shortest way for the return of peace stability and security to Darfur. My Government signeda working plan for Darfur with the United Nations; thisplan included detailed arrangements for humanitarianaid  security and protection of displaced persons andtheir voluntary return. We assigned extra police forces numbering 10 000. We also signed an agreement withthe International Organization for Migration on thereturn of refugees.Within the framework of a political settlement and despite the intransigence and lack of seriousness ofthe rebels  my Government accepted the invitationextended by President Obasanjo of Nigeria  the currentChairman of the African Union. We then sent anotherhigh-ranking delegation to Abuja on 23 August out ofour belief in the political settlement as a strategicoption. As it happened in the Addis Ababanegotiations  the Security Council adopted itsresolution 1564 (2004) last Saturday  18 September which gave more incentive to the rebels and sent theman erroneous message to continue their intransigence.This led to the failure of the negotiations.Security Council resolution 1564 (2004) did notconsider my Governmentís efforts to contain thehumanitarian crisis in Darfur  which led to dÈtente inthe situation. It did not pay attention to myGovernmentís warning about the negative impact ofany measures that would hamper the efforts made bythe African Union for the peaceful settlement of thequestion of Darfur.We call upon the international community toprovide assistance to the needy population in Darfur.At the same time  we ask for support and promotion ofthe African Union's efforts and that the situation on theground not be further complicated or the Unionísefforts undermined.Believing in our own principles  our sense ofresponsibility and the attention my Governmentattaches to human rights questions  we have cooperatedwith international and voluntary organizations for thedevelopment and enhancement of human rights in mycountry. We have ratified this year the AfricanChildren's Initiative and  over the past months  wehave received some independent experts and specialrapporteurs sent by the Office of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Incooperation with OHCHR  we have deployed a team ofhuman rights observers in Darfur. Sudan's doors willbe open for all those who want to know the truth. Wehave nothing to hide. Our efforts were not limited to43cooperating with the international community. We havetaken some measures at the local level  and we haveestablished a national independent committee toinvestigate allegations of human rights violations inDarfur. Also  there are other committees to investigatethe other claims of rape in the Darfur region besidesour efforts to provide protection  peace and security toour citizens.Since the beginning of the crisis  my Governmenthas not hesitated to recognize that there has been ahumanitarian problem in Darfur and a security problemthat ought to be dealt with through a comprehensivepolitical solution  despite the fact that the rebelmovement led to this problem by starting violence andfighting. Then we resorted to the internationalcommunity in general and the African Union and theLeague of Arab States in particular.We hope that the international community especially the Security Council  will cooperate with usto find a solution instead of issuing threats andcondemnations. The last Security Council resolution isa living example of such threats.We welcome the international communityísinvestigation of the Darfur violations. As I said  wehave nothing to hide. What we all want from theSecretary-General  who is responsible for theestablishment of this committee  and from the SecurityCouncil is confirmation of the credibility of theinternational organization so that this internationalcommittee would be neutral and professional. We donot want a committee like that headed by RichardButler  who prepared his report at another locationwhere it was signed and submitted to the SecurityCouncil indicating that it represented the position ofthe Organization.We hope that the voices of those who took certainpositions regarding Darfur will be silent until theinternational committeeís report is issued. We face avery delicate situation and developments in the worldtoday  and we need to face such challenges bygarnering the political will to enhance the role of theUnited Nations and its agencies in order to carry outtheir functions within the framework of a realdemocracy that would express the interests and hopesof all peoples and confront the challenges of thetwenty-first century.We must accelerate our current efforts that havebeen going on for a decade now for Security Councilreform and to develop its methods of work. The bodythat is responsible for international peace and securityis composed of permanent members  whose monopolyof the veto reflects a great imbalance over the simplestcriteria of justice. Among the five permanentMembers  there are three from one geographical group;two of them are from Western Europe. There is norepresentation whatsoever for entire continents  such asAfrica or Latin America  and vast regions of Asia.Therefore  any discussion about submitting anothercandidate from Western Europe before taking thesecontinents into consideration would be a consecrationof this imbalanced equation and of the Westíshegemony over the affairs of this Organization.Terrorism and extremism are among thechallenges facing the world today. We declare our totalrejection and condemnation of this destructivephenomenon; but at the same time there is anunacceptable misunderstanding and confusion betweenterrorism and the struggles of people to achieve theirindependence and to rid themselves of foreignoccupation. This misunderstanding culminates in theextreme when terrorism is linked to followers of acertain religion or culture. Terrorism has no religion orhomeland. We stand with the international communityand cooperate with it in its fight to eliminate terrorism and we call for an international agreement on adefinition of terrorism and to find the best means toface this plague through collective efforts.The gap between the rich and poor countries iswidening within a system of globalization that furtherenriches the wealthy and impoverishes the poor. It hasbecome an obstacle for the international communityand the aspirations to a free and dignified life ofbillions of people in developing countries. Theimbalance in todayís world economy and free trade isobvious. It will have an adverse effect not only on thedeveloping countries but will lead also to totalcatastrophe in the whole world. We need to havepolitical resolve  as stated by world leaders in theMillennium Declaration four years ago  and later atMonterrey and Johannesburg.Developing and least developed countries are stillsuffering from hunger and poverty.Let us renew hope for the hundreds of millions ofpoor and hungry people by translating that politicalwill into concrete action in order to provide them witheducation and drinking water and to eliminate hunger 44destitution and disease by focusing on the goals andprogrammes that we have repeatedly agreed on. In thisconnection  we would like to pay tribute to theinternational initiative on the new Action AgainstHunger and Poverty.Israelís oppressive policies against unarmedPalestinian people  the imposition of closures onoccupied Palestinian land  the extrajudicial crimescommitted there  the demolition of houses  thestarvation and intimidation  the increased settlementactivities and the besieging of the Palestinian Presidentall require that the international community bringpressure to bear on Israel to stop those acts. The Sudanwelcomes the advisory opinion of the InternationalCourt of Justice on the illegality of the separation walland on compensation for all losses caused by it. Wewelcome resolution ES-10/15  adopted by the GeneralAssembly at its tenth emergency session  on 20 July2004  demanding that Israel abide by that opinion. Aninternational  comprehensive and just peace in theMiddle East will be reached only when Israelwithdraws from all occupied Arab lands  including theSyrian Golan Heights and the Lebanese Shaliía farms.There will be no peace or stability until the Palestinianpeople recover their legitimate rights  including theirright to establish an independent Palestinian State withJerusalem as its capital and the right of refugees toreturn to their lands.The difficult situation facing the Iraqi peoplemakes it necessary to assist them to overcome theirproblems. Here we reaffirm the unity and independenceof the Iraqi people and their right to self-determination.We hope that the restoration of those rights will lead tosecurity and stability and to a return to normality inIraq and that it will enable the Iraqi people to exercisetheir right to choose their own political leadershipthrough free and fair elections. We call upon theinternational community to support the Iraqiprovisional Government  to help in the reconstructionof Iraq and to support any initiative that would enablethe Iraqis to live in dignity in their own country.Our efforts complement those efforts of theAfrican Union to achieve stability and development inour continent  a continent so rich natural and humanresources and capabilities. We have resolved to settleour conflicts and crises  which squander such resourcesand capabilities  and to work instead to promoteeconomic and social development through the NewPartnership for Africaís Development (NEPAD).In conclusion  we reaffirm our determination toachieve a comprehensive and just peace that wouldlead to stability and well-being for the people of theSudan and would bolster African Union efforts towardseconomic and social integrity. We look forward to theUnited Nations playing its role in establishing justicein international relations based on understanding cooperation and mutual interests and avoidingconfrontation and sanctions  which have proven to beharmful to people."
"151",6142,"SEN",59,2004,"The delegationof Senegal would like to congratulate you very warmly Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of thefifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I assureyou of our full support as you carry out your noblework. I also wish to extend my congratulations andencouragement to all the members of the Bureau.I would also like to recognize the commitment ofSecretary-General Kofi Annan  whose tireless effortsto make the United Nations a strong  working andcredible Organization reflects his faith in the ideals ofpeace  development and concord among peoples. Wemust now continue to breathe life into these ideals  sothat current and future generations will have a peacefuland safe world  a world without absurd hatred orgratuitous violence. This vision should lead us to re-invigorate the values of multilateralism and universalitythat are epitomized by our Organization. In other words the world needs now  more than ever  a United Nationsthat is strong and strengthened in its legitimacy.We welcome  therefore  the decision of theUnited Nations Secretary-General to establish a panelof eminent persons on threats  challenges and change whose conclusions will be presented next December. Inthis respect  we recall the African position on reform ofthe Security Council  which advocates among otherthings  the assignment to Africa of at least twopermanent seats and two extra non-permanent seats.Africa would choose the recipients of those seatsaccording to a process that has yet to be determined.As I extol universality  I feel it is unfair that theRepublic of China on Taiwan  with its 23 millioninhabitants  its major democratic system and itsimpressive economic vitality  would still be sidelinedfrom the work of the United Nations  whose Charterdoes rightly enshrine the essential principles of justiceand universality.This denial of justice also affects the valiantpeople of Palestine  who  under the legitimate authorityof President Yasser Arafat  have been deprived of itsfundamental right to sovereignty and ongoingexistence. The defiant attitude of the occupying Powervis-à-vis the international community  recentlyillustrated by the Israeli authorities’ refusal to abide bythe opinion of the International Court of Justicerequiring Israel to immediately stop the illegal building2of the separation wall in Palestinian territory  imperilsthe foundations of international legality. I solemnlyappeal to the international community and  inparticular  to the members of the Quartet  asking themto persevere in their efforts for an immediateresumption of dialogue  so that we may achieve a fair equitable and lasting solution to this disagreement. Thepeoples of Palestine and Israel  needless to recall  arecondemned by history and geography to live together.For our part  Senegal  which chairs the UnitedNations Committee on the Exercise of the InalienableRights of the Palestinian People  will continue  with itspeople  to unfailingly support the Palestinian people battered by this crisis that has lasted far too long. As acontribution to the quest for peace  I suggested that weconduct a special meeting  outside our regular work  onthe situation in Palestine aimed at enhancing the worklaunched by the Quartet and in the spirit of the roadmap  in order to establish by 2005 a sovereign andviable Palestinian State  living side by side with theState of Israel  within safe and internationallyrecognized borders guaranteed for the two States. Thisinitiative  which has already been endorsed by theNon-Aligned Movement and the African Union  willprovide an opportunity to mobilize the internationalcommunity around the effective implementation of theroad map.In awarding me yesterday the 2004 HumanRights Award  the International League for HumanRights in fact honoured  through Senegal’s head ofState  all of the Senegalese people  a people attached tofreedom and to the respect of human dignity. MyGovernment will continue to work to promote andprotect human rights  the rule of law and good publicand private governance. In talking about human rights I am naturally thinking of the fundamental rights ofwomen  children  disabled persons  seniors and allvulnerable people. This deep commitment to mankindmotivated my decision to submit draft legislation to theSenegalese national assembly to abolish capitalpunishment in Senegal.Almost 60 years after the establishment of ourOrganization  our world  which is so fragile  still seeslongstanding dangers such as nuclear proliferation andthe emergence of new dangers such as terrorism andAIDS  which represent a serious threat to internationalpeace and security. I must remind Members here of theneed to do more to strengthen  under the leadership ofthe Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee the mechanisms that already exist for cooperation andtechnical assistance in order to provide those countrieswho so wish human  technical and adequate financialresources to combat terrorism. This initiative  ofcourse  must be paired with States’ increased adherenceto treaties and protocols in this key area. It is for thispurpose that the African Union adopted last July anadditional protocol to the Organization of AfricanUnity’s Algiers Convention on the Prevention andCombating of Terrorism  proposed by Senegal on17 October 2001 at the African conference onterrorism  held in Dakar.This collective approach should also be adoptedto tackle the difficult problem of small arms and lightweapons. Senegal supports making the moratorium onthe importation  exportation and production of smallarms and light weapons of the Economic Communityof West African States into a convention in WestAfrica  since these arms are truly weapons of massdestruction in our subregion.There are other destructive scourges. I would liketo speak about AIDS. In accordance with thedeclaration that we adopted in 2001  we must act morequickly and more vigorously in critical areas such asprevention and access to antiretroviral treatments if wereally do wish to stop this disease and its devastatingeffects. Since antiretroviral medication is now free forall those who are afflicted  thanks to our tenacity Senegal has remained a success story in combatingAIDS.Another seemingly ignored ill is poliomyelitis which we have completely eliminated in Senegal.However  this scourge remains as serious as ever in therest of Africa.During this second trimester of 2004  the Northand West parts of Africa have witnessed the invasionof swarms of locusts  the dreaded scourge which hasinfested large agricultural areas in the region of theSahel and some North African countries. This threat which has already destroyed entire civilizations  is nowcompromising the lives of tens of millions of peopleright before harvest time. At the very beginning  Ipersonally sounded the alarm  speaking to theinternational community in Rome last March. Despiteanother appeal by the Director-General of the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) assistance was late in coming and is only now underway  but in ways that are not very effective.3Whatever the case may be  Senegal has begun towork on this issue  and today we are succeeding incontaining this danger. Together with neighbouringcountries  the countries bordering the Sahel  we aretrying to launch an extensive campaign for the finalelimination of these locusts. In this regard  we notewith great satisfaction the involvement of Africancountries  including Algeria  Morocco  Nigeria  SouthAfrica  Libya and Egypt in this issue. Today  ourpeople remain concerned about the possible migrationof these locusts  carried by the wind  to other areas inthe region  in particular to the Maghreb. We are alsopleased to announce that we have received substantialsupport by the World Bank  among other internationalorganizations. This means that we have a sharedresponsibility to strengthen and mobilize theinternational community against locusts and  if wesucceed in saving the crops  to completely eliminatethem  starting at their source.The task at hand in this area should not make uslose sight of the huge field of work that remains to betackled  namely combating the poverty that strikesmillions of people throughout the world  in particularin the least developed countries so that we can achievethe Millennium Development Goals in terms ofagriculture. I must say here that I am satisfied with theoutcome of the meeting that was held on the initiativeof President Lula  the President of Brazil.Yet we all see and are concerned that  as has beenemphasized by the Secretary-General and others  inspite of the relative improvement in the economicsituation in Africa since 1995  the chances of ourcontinent achieving the Millennium DevelopmentGoals are still rather low given the lack of progress todate. Implementation of those Goals is particularly at riskeven at a time when the world economy is progressingin an encouraging way: Africa continues  mainlybecause of the export subsidies of developed countries to be marginalized in world trade. It is a truism to saythat those subsidies help to impoverish Africanproducer countries and increase unemployment.Another problem is the thorny issue of Africandebt. The continent has dedicated itself to resolution ofthis problem: next year we will hold a major summitpreceded by a technical meeting on ending Africa’sindebtedness.The Extraordinary Summit of the African Unionon Employment and Poverty Alleviation in Africa  justheld in Ouagadougou on 8 and 9 September  illustratesour continent’s determination to continue to devotespecial attention to the fight against unemployment which is a key priority for development. A successfuloutcome — in keeping with the outcomes of the varioussummits which have given direction to the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) —requires the international community to make astronger commitment  alongside Africa  to helpmaterialize this important partnership programme. Andthat is why I say that I am pleased to see the progresswe have made on NEPAD financing since the Group ofEight (G-8) meeting in Kananaskis  Canada.Although insufficiently highlighted  efforts forAfrican development made under NEPAD and thesupport actions of the international community —particularly those taken by the G-8 and the UnitedNations system — are still in evidence  which pleasesme. We have made basically two proposals. The firsthas to do with the convening in Senegal’s capital of anagricultural forum  on the model of the Davoseconomic forum  for the purpose  inter alia  of closingthe world agricultural gap. It will be held in February2005 in Dakar.The ever-growing digital divide separates thedeveloped countries from the developing countries. InDecember 2003 in Geneva  the Secretary-Generalconvened The World Summit on the InformationSociety. On that occasion  Africa proposed  throughmyself  the idea of digital solidarity among peoples andthe establishment of a digital solidarity fund based onvolunteer efforts and not funded by any mandatory tax.That idea was received with unanimous enthusiasm bydeveloping countries — Africa  Asia  Brazil  theMiddle East — and by a developed country: France.Subsequently  the inaugural congress for the UnitedCities and Local Governments organization was held inParis in May 2004; participants officially announcedtheir participation in the digital solidarity fund. To thecities already mentioned elsewhere  I could add Rome Paris  Lille and Bilbao.We are pleased that the Secretary-General hasestablished a task force on financing the informationsociety under the decision adopted at Geneva.Providing Africa with the hardware and other computertechnology it needs is the only way to give us access tothe knowledge that accelerates development and which  in turn  will help to close the digital divide.4As members can see  the challenges we face areenormous  numerous and pressing. The time has cometo strengthen the foundations of internationalcooperation and  once and for all  to exorcize the riskof social bipolarization throughout the world whereaffluence rubs elbows with the most extreme povertyand where the values of solidarity and respect for thesacredness of human life become vain words. That iswhy I suggested that we hold an internationalconference in Dakar on an Islamic-Christian dialogue whose objectives would be to help us better understandone another  to strengthen peaceful coexistencebetween Muslims and Christians and to promote adialogue among cultures.Thus  by hosting the eleventh Islamic Summit in2006  Senegal  which has a majority Muslimpopulation living in perfect harmony with theirChristian brothers  will continue its action to promotefruitful inter-religious dialogue focused on thesacrosanct principle of respect for the cultural andreligious identities of all peoples."
"152",6189,"SGP",59,2004,"First  I would like tocongratulate His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping of Gabon  onhis election as the President of the General Assembly.We meet in New York under conditions of highsecurity. All over the world  Governments corporations and individuals are allocating vastresources to combat terrorism. The Beslan massacrelast month and the Jakarta bombing two weeks agoremind us once again that the war against terrorism is along struggle. Fighting it requires us to cooperateworldwide. It is also important for us to understandmore deeply why terrorists are prepared to sacrificetheir own lives to take the lives of others  includingthose of innocent children.The human condition has not changed. There is inhuman beings a restless  competitive spirit that strivesto get ahead  make discoveries and order or reorder theworld according to their values and world-view. It is adrive that can lead to great good or great evil.The greatest evil is often committed out of asense of self-righteousness. That has been the casethroughout history. Al Qaeda carries out its actions inthe name of Islam  which is a gross perversion.Religious wars are the most cruel because humanbeings are maimed and killed in the name of the divine.Ethnic and ideological conflicts sometimes turn30genocidal when one side believes that right iscompletely on its side.Unrestrained economic competition can also leadto grave injustice. Without rules  ruthless economiccompetition will return us to the jungle. Without theWorld Trade Organization (WTO)  globalization canbecome a tool with which the strong can dominate theweak  just as in an earlier period entire continents werecarved up by imperial Powers.Global organizations like the United Nations andWTO give us hope that this century can be morecivilized than previous ones. We need rules that putlimits on our competitiveness in the political andeconomic arenas. As in the Olympic Games  clear rulesand their rigorous enforcement enable individuals tocompete fiercely and triumph within a framework ofsportsmanship and fairness. The rules are not there todampen our natural competitive spirit  but to direct ittowards positive achievement.But the rules have to be determined by commonagreement. Their legitimacy is derived from the sharedvalues that bind participants together. They have toevolve  along with our evolving sense of what is fairand proper. They cannot be imposed. If they areimposed  what we have will not be the Olympics butthe gladiatorial pits of the Roman Colosseum.At the most fundamental level  discussions anddebates in the United Nations and WTO are reallyabout the values that bind us together as human beings.As the world grows smaller  our sense ofinterdependence grows. As we interact more  wediscover that we are more similar than we think. Somany problems like global warming  epidemics andterrorism can only be overcome if we work together.So many new opportunities can only be fully exploitedif we combine our efforts.Yes  we have become closer. We celebrated togetherwhen for the first time the human genome was mapped afew years ago. We grieved as one on 11 September2001. The slaughter of children at Beslan outraged usall. But will we ever be the same? That is not possible.It is neither in our biological nature nor in the nature ofthe historical process for human societies to convergeand become identical. Even the same society changesover time in response to changing conditions.There is in each and everyone of us a deep desireto be free  to experiment and to be better than othersaround us. Like all forms of energy  human energymust be channelled so that it is constructive and notdestructive. That is the challenge of governance at alllevels  from the village all the way to globalinstitutions. With the world becoming a village becauseof the ease of travel and instant communication  thedesign of global institutions is very important. Theyhelp us solve problems which we cannot solveindividually and set limits on acceptable behaviour.The problem of Palestine  for example  cannot besolved without the participation of the larger globalcommunity. All of us are aware of the rights andwrongs  and sometimes particular issues are right orwrong  depending on our perspective. However  weshould never lose hope. We should always look for newand creative ways to break old deadlocks. After all  itwas only a few years ago that the prospects for peaceseemed so much brighter.I remember when  as Singapore’s Trade Minister I met the Israeli Trade Minister at Davos in the year2000. He said that he would like to visit me inSingapore with his Palestinian counterpart and together with me  to take a boat to the Singaporeindustrial park on a nearby Indonesian island  where hehoped that we could all be received by the IndonesianTrade Minister. I was inspired and immediately workedwith my Indonesian counterpart on this project ofunderstanding and goodwill. Unfortunately  within halfa year  the intifada began and the cycle of violencebecame steadily worse. It all seems such a long timeago. However  we must never give up. With goodwilland statesmanship on both sides  and with the supportof all of us in the international community  it ispossible to re-establish trust and to start again.Moreover  the international community shouldnot allow the deteriorating relationship across theTaiwan Straits to spin out of control. The push towardsindependence by certain groups on Taiwan is mostdangerous  because it will lead to war with mainlandChina and will drag in other countries. The stability ofthe entire Asia-Pacific region is at stake. Not manyyears ago  the relationship between the mainland andTaiwan was much better. In 1991  Asia-Pacific EconomicCooperation (APEC) — a grouping of economies aroundthe Pacific Ocean — admitted China  Taiwan and HongKong on the basis of certain agreed principles. At anAPEC meeting in 1992  I remember joining the TradeMinisters of China  Taiwan and Hong Kong for arelaxed lunch in Bangkok. Later  in 1993 31representatives from China and Taiwan met in Singaporefor informal talks  with both sides acknowledging  “OneChina: to each its own interpretation”.All problems seemed soluble then. But  in 1994 Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui gave a shockinginterview to a Japanese magazine  describing himselfas a Moses leading his people out of Egypt. From thenon  cross-straits relations went from bad to worse aspro-independence forces on Taiwan becameincreasingly adventurous. As in the Middle East  theinternational community has a strong vested interest insupporting a peaceful resolution of cross-straitsconflict  based on the “one China” position that wasadopted and settled by the United Nations in 1971.Even when the United Nations has no legalauthority to enforce its wishes  its views carry moralweight. This legitimacy of the Organization is derivedfrom its broad membership  its transparent processesand the active participation of Member States. It isimportant that the Security Council — which has thepower to adopt resolutions binding on all UnitedNations Member States — be reformed and enlarged soas to reflect the reality of the current internationalenvironment.We need rules that enable us to make decisionsand to express our collective judgement of right andwrong  and those rules must evolve in response to newchallenges. However  we cannot expect unanimity ofviews on all matters. Human society is changing all thetime. New scientific discoveries present newchallenges  to which different societies must responddifferently. On matters of religious belief  for example no one should expect convergence. Our disagreementsover issues like the death penalty  abortion  the natureof democracy  gay rights  animal rights and therapeuticcloning are  in a sense  inevitable and necessary.What we profoundly need is respect for plurality inthe world — respect built on the common substrate thatdefines us as civilized human beings in the twenty-firstcentury. In the nineteenth century  slavery was abolished.In the twentieth century  gender equality became thenorm. In this century  we must add more layers to whatwe share in common. And  upon that shared substrate  weshould not only accept diversity  but encourage it. Indeed as with biological diversity  it is essential for humanprogress that there should be cultural and politicaldiversity in the world. Without such diversity  ourability to respond to new challenges will be weakened.For all their imperfections  the United Nationsand the World Trade Organization (WTO) representthis diversity in unity. At the WTO  the process ofmultilateral trade negotiations — however complicatedand arduous they may be — is still a more civilizedmethod of resolving conflicts and harmonizing nationaldifferences than erecting protectionist walls andfighting trade wars.Respecting plurality does not mean that we stoprecognizing strengths and weaknesses; that would behypocrisy. Some cultural values are more suited thanothers to modern times. Some economic systems aremore productive. Some political systems are better ableto mobilize the creative energies of their people. Butnone of us should force our views on others. We shouldnever impose a particular political or economic systemon societies with different histories and traditions.What we need instead is an environment thatencourages mutual learning and healthy competition.For that  we need to respect one another.As is recognized in the Millennium DevelopmentGoals  there is no one-size-fits-all solution to thechallenge of human development. When Singaporebecame independent in 1965  there was no readysolution that fitted us; we had to seek our own wayforward. Many countries helped us with aid and advice and we remain grateful to them. The United NationsDevelopment Programme provided valuable assistance.With no natural resources  we had to organizeourselves in a practical way  add value and be ofservice to others. Little by little  we worked outpragmatic solutions to our problems. Good governancewas a precondition for all our efforts. We were toughon corruption and crime.When  in the 1970s  we witnessed attempts byinternational drug dealers to target youngSingaporeans  our Parliament adopted draconian laws.We were criticized by some of our friends in theWestern media  but we persisted  with the support ofthe majority of Singaporeans  always acting with theirconsent and in their interests. Now that we havereached a reasonable standard of economicdevelopment  other developing countries haveapproached us for assistance. We feel honoured to beasked. But we prefer them to see Singapore more as anongoing experiment to be studied than as a model tofollow. Every country is different  and each mustcustomize its own solutions.32Small countries like Singapore need a stableexternal environment. We are ardent supporters ofinternational organizations like the United Nations andthe WTO  because they give us  together with othercountries  a say in global governance. A world inwhich countries big and small can resolve disputesaccording to commonly agreed rules is infinitelypreferable to one in which might makes right.More than four centuries ago  a wise man fromthe West visited the East. The Italian Jesuit MatteoRicci went to China with the goal of converting Chinato Catholicism. He had a deep respect for thecivilization that he wanted to Christianize. Realizingthat the only way to impress the Chinese was tointeract with them on their own terms  he proceeded tostudy the Chinese language  to master the Chineseclassics and to employ Chinese philosophical conceptsin his discourses on Christianity. Instead of talking atthe Chinese  he talked to them  expressing concepts towhich they could relate. Although Matteo Ricci did notsucceed in converting the Chinese  he left behind alasting legacy  and when he died the Chinese Emperorconsented to his burial in China. His tomb  inscribedwith his Chinese name  is to be found today in thecompound of the Party School of the Beijing MunicipalCommittee.History is unending. We need wise men likeMatteo Ricci from the West and the East  from theSouth and the North  to help us  through debate anddialogue  prevent a clash of civilizations. Respectingdiversity should never reduce us to hypocrisy andcultural relativism  as if all points of view are equallyvalid. We should never stop trying to influence oneanother. Here in the United Nations we are alwaystrying to influence one another  but we must always beprepared to see the same issues from the perspectivesof others. Here in the United Nations  we have aninstitution that can help us create this better world."
"153",6222,"SLB",59,2004,"At the outset allow me  on behalf of the Government and people ofSolomon Islands  to convey to you our warm andsincere congratulations on your election as President ofthis session of the United Nations General Assembly.May I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to yourpredecessor  our colleague  the Honourable JulianHunte  Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia  for his ableand sterling stewardship in making the Assembly’sfifty-eighth session proactive and responsive to thechallenges it has faced over the last 12 months.I also wish to express our deep appreciation tothe United Nations Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan  for his focused leadership in steeringthe work of the Secretariat through difficult andsometimes uncharted waters over the past year.Only four years into the new millennium  thecomplexity of ongoing and new challenges hasredefined the international system  resulting inuncertainty and imbalances in certain parts of theglobe. Ensuing debates over multilateralism versusunilateralism in the resolution of crisis situations haveepitomized the complex nature of events during thepast year. This makes the call two years ago by ourSecretary-General for institutional reforms more urgentnow than ever before.Solomon Islands looks forward to therecommendations of the High-level Panel of EminentPersons  in particular  to proposals that will revitalizeand give new momentum to the United Nations. Thesereforms must ensure that the United Nations is flexibleand responsive to the needs of our time. To this end Solomon Islands fully supports the proposedenlargement of the Council and reaffirms its call forJapan and Germany to become permanent members ofthe Council. We believe that the enlargement shouldaffect both the permanent and non-permanentmembership categories. It is also our fervent hope anddesire to see that the Secretariat reflects the diversityof its membership. In this regard  while it shouldcontinue to recruit the best available candidates opportunities within the Secretariat must be madeavailable to small island countries on the basis of in-country  rather than externally conducted  assessmentexaminations.As you are aware  this year the United Nationsfamily marked the tenth anniversary of the ethnic15genocide in Rwanda. The occasion called on the UnitedNations to play a more proactive role towards ensuringthat such tragic events are never allowed to happenagain.No more than four years ago  my own country Solomon Islands  experienced the hardship of aconflict situation when tensions erupted between twoof the many ethnic groups in the country. In response Solomon Islands sought assistance from every possibleinstitution  including the Security Council. In thisregard  I am pleased to say that my region  through thePacific Islands Forum under its security mechanism asenshrined in the Biketawa Declaration  responded tothat “911” call.The Pacific Islands Forum regional securitymechanism is in harmony with the spirit of ChapterVIII of the United Nations Charter. The RegionalAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)  ledby our bigger regional neighbour  Australia  stronglysupported by New Zealand and other Pacific IslandsForum member countries  went beyond the mererestoration of law and order and security. In a spirit ofPacific cooperation and partnership between SolomonIslands and Pacific Islands Forum member countries  along-term approach of strengthening the country’sState institutions was set in place  thus allowing theprocess of healing  reconstruction  rehabilitation andnation-building to continue the course of unifying thecountry and its less than half a million  but diverse inhabitants  who speak some 80 different locallanguages.The success of the Regional Assistance Missionto Solomon Islands in promptly stabilizing the countrywithin a period of three months  collecting some 3 700weapons without a shot being fired  presents a fineexample of the importance of regional cooperation inresolving conflict situations. On this note  I wish to paytribute to all our Pacific neighbours and to the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP)  theCommission for Human Rights  the World HealthOrganization (WHO)  the European Union (EU)  theRepublic of China  Japan  the United Kingdom  theInternational Red Cross and the civil society; they haveassisted and are continuing to assist in the process ofour country’s ongoing recovery and rehabilitation.I must also underscore my belief and convictionthat in order for peace to be achieved it must bedesired; moreover  I would add  there must be aworkable mechanism to ensure its realization andsustenance. In this regard  my Government is fullyconvinced that the positive results of our partnershipwith RAMSI could be sustained through our recentlyadopted National Economic Recovery  Reform andDevelopment Plan (NERRDP)  which provides ablueprint for an integrated process of development andnation-building for the common good of our people.I am further convinced  that the Pacific Planrecently adopted by the Pacific Islands Forum leadersin Apia  Samoa  represents a regional road map forcooperation that could complement national effortsaimed at building an improved and secure livelihoodfor the diverse people of the region. Through itscreation of stronger and deeper links between countriesin the region and resource-sharing  includinggovernance and aligning of policies  the Pacific Plancould assist our countries to address challenges andissues that sovereign member States may lack theability and capacity to address individually as a resultof our countries’ smallness and inherent limitationscaused by economies of scale.Solomon Islands notes the positive developmentsthat have taken place in the peace process onBougainville. We recognize the important role playedby the United Nations in the peace process there andwould urge its continuing involvement to see theprocess through. Solomon Islands  for its part  hassigned a number of bilateral agreements with PapuaNew Guinea  which will support the good work thathas already been undertaken towards peace.On the issue of Palestine  my delegationsubscribes to the view that the resolution of the MiddleEast conflict can only be possible through negotiations.It is in this spirit that we call upon all parties to abideby the Quartet’s road map for peace  and we urge a haltto all acts of aggression.Turning to the global fight against terrorism  therecent terrorist attacks  especially in Iraq  Indonesia and the Beslan school in southern Russia manifest thecontinuing menace and evil of terrorism at large. Wehave witnessed many innocent lives  including those ofwomen and children  being lost due to these senselessterror attacks. My delegation offers its deepestcondolences to those who have lost loved ones duringthese unforgivable incidents. Solomon Islandscondemns in the strongest possible terms such acts ofterror and fully support international efforts to combatthis scourge. In this regard  I wish to join others incalling on the global community to support smallStates to build their national capacities towardsongoing efforts aimed at combating transnational16crimes  such as arms smuggling  drug trafficking people smuggling  money laundering and terrorism.The United Nations Charter promotes theeconomic and social progress of Member States especially those facing special development problems.For a country recovering from a post-conflict situation Solomon Islands considers international frameworkssuch as the Brussels Programme of Action for theLeast Developed Countries  and the BarbadosProgramme of Action for Small Island DevelopingStates as vehicles for enhancing peace and achievingthe Millennium Development Goals. Solomon Islandsis a small island developing State and a least developedcountry  where its development challenges aremultifaceted in nature. Unfortunately  the level ofinternational cooperation envisaged for theProgrammes either have not materialized or have beenminimal. Despite this  my Government is undertakingreforms that include the appointment of a nationalfocal point for the Brussels Programme of Action.Hence  we are hopeful that  with better coordination Solomon Islands can take full advantage of andmaximize all opportunities the Programme has to offer.The issue of debt-servicing continues to presentchallenges  and even obstacles  to the developmentprogrammes of many poor developing States. Debtburdens continue to divert attention in national budgetsaway from the development of necessaryinfrastructures and the delivery of basic and essentialsocial services. Solomon Islands therefore calls on theinternational community to give greater attention todebt issues.Solomon Islands attaches much importance to theMillennium Development Goals  and these have beenmainstreamed into our NERRDP. While we will use the2005 high-level event mentioned in the SecretaryGeneral’s 2004 report on the implementation of theMillennium Development Goals to take stock of ourprogress  we are confident that NERRDP can serve as aroad map for the medium to long-term implementationof our commitments. NERRDP provides a usefulframework within which important issues  such aseconomic and institutional reform  good governance upholding of democracy and its values of freedom  andrespect for the basic principles of human rights can benurtured and harnessed for the betterment andimprovement of the livelihood of our people andsociety  including the sustenance of peace in ourcountry.Solomon Islands would like to pay closerattention to the emerging health threats it faces. Inparticular  malaria remains the predominant cause ofdeath of among children in Solomon Islands. The lackof data on HIV/AIDS presents a threat to the countryand has the potential of creating a devastating impacton its economy and social structure. With the supportof WHO  the Global Fund to fight AIDS and Japan  weare determined to put in place appropriate preventiveactions.Solomon Islands  which is geographicallyscattered across some 1 800 kilometres  comprisingalmost 1 000 small islands and atolls  has anagriculture-based economy that is dependent on theenvironment. Sustainable management of resources isessential for guaranteeing the security of futuregenerations.The hurricanes that hit the southern UnitedStates  the Bahamas  Grenada  Haiti and Jamaica in theCaribbean in the recent past; cyclone Heita  whichdevastated Niue in 2003; flooding in Fiji; andcontinuous heavy rains in Solomon Islands all bringhome the stark reality of our world’s vulnerability tonatural disasters. We realize the great difficulty andpain that smaller island developing States face inmitigating the magnitude and impact of such disasters.To this end  we extend our condolences and sympathyfor the loss of life and property caused by the recenthurricanes in Grenada and Haiti and would urge theinternational community to assist in relief efforts tothose who are affected.Generally  Solomon Islands strongly feels thatmore could be done by the international communitytowards safeguarding our environment. Hence  weacknowledge the partnership of the Global Fund inassisting environmental programmes globally  and wewould encourage that the focus of further assistanceshould extend to other sectors of sustainabledevelopment  such as energy  water and sanitation.My delegation has closely followed the review ofthe Barbados Programme of Action and thedevelopment of a Group of 77 strategy paper. Whilenegotiations are still ongoing  Solomon Islands  as amember of the Alliance of Small Island States(AOSIS)  acknowledges that the strategy paperstrengthens the Barbados Programme and places it asan action-oriented programme with which we can allidentify. We are hopeful the Mauritius meeting willrevitalize our efforts towards protecting theenvironment and enhancing sustainable development.17Trade remains a significant source of economicgrowth and development for many developing States.Regionally  Pacific island countries have graduallybegun the process of regional integration. South-Southtrade cooperation among Forum island countriesculminated in the entry into force of the Pacific IslandCountries Trade Agreement last year  and theMelanesian Spearhead Group trade agreement is beingreviewed with a view to further broadening its scopeand its markets 10 years after its inception. The Pacificmembers of the Africa  Caribbean and Pacific Group ofStates are negotiating an economic partnershipagreement with the European Union in the frameworkof the Cotonou Agreement. Those developmentsmanifest continuing preparations by small islanddeveloping economies in the Pacific Islands Forumregion for gradual adaptation into the broader processof the globalization of the world economy.Solomon Islands notes that the eleventh sessionof the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment  convened in June this year in São Paulo built confidence and consensus on ongoing multilateraltrade negotiations. Solomon Islands supports thatprocess and urges making it more participatory andinclusive so that no one is left behind  especially thesmall and vulnerable island developing economies andthe least developed countries. We are mindful of theneed to recognize the inherent structural problems ofgeographical size  isolation from markets and theconstraints resulting from a lack of supply-sidecapacities and economies of scale  especially in thecase of small island developing States such as SolomonIslands. However  as a member of the World TradeOrganization  we are pleased that the Doha round ofmultilateral trade negotiations embraces a developmentdimension  in particular the recognition of the principleof special and differential treatment  in its workprogramme on small island developing economies.One of the principles of the United NationsCharter is to open membership to all States that accepttheir Charter obligations. The Republic of China onTaiwan has registered its interest in being part of theUnited Nations family. Solomon Islands once againcalls for the Republic of China to be made a fullMember of the United Nations. Solomon Islandsenjoys warm and cordial relations with the Republic ofChina and is mindful of the threats facing the worldtoday. Threats such as severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS) are transnational and transborder innature and require the cooperation and engagement ofall countries of the world. To deny one country theright to participate weakens global mechanisms andjeopardizes the security of all.The Republic of China on Taiwan is democratic and its vibrant economy is ranked seventeenth globally.It has the third largest foreign exchange reserves. Itsdevelopment experience offers important lessons onthe need to embrace freedom  respect for the basicprinciples of human rights  respect for freedom of thepress and the uninhibited functioning of democraticinstitutions. The Republic of China’s ability andcapacity to contribute to strengthening the UnitedNations should be seriously considered  especially at atime when the Organization could do with all the helpit can receive.Solomon Islands calls upon the Assembly to finda process that will allow the Republic of China onTaiwan to become a full and equal Member of theUnited Nations. The Pacific Islands Forum has amechanism that engages both Chinas in our dialogueprocess  and we have continuously benefited from thatrich interaction.To conclude  I call upon the Assembly to get realand confront the increasingly varied and complexchallenges we face today. The purpose and the role ofthe United Nations are ultimately to create a peaceful just and prosperous world that offers hope to all. Thatrequires making the Organization flexible  innovativeand responsive to ever-changing global demands. Thus the onus is on us to make bold and tough decisions thatbreathe new life into our Organization."
"154",6268,"SLE",59,2004,"I would like to joinothers in congratulating you  Mr. President  on yourelection to direct the affairs of the GeneralAssembly — this great parliament of nations — at itsfifty-ninth session. Let me also take this opportunity topay tribute to your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Julian Hunte  especially for the momentum he gaveto the ongoing process of the revitalization of theGeneral Assembly.Once again  in his annual report on the work ofthe Organization and in his forthright statement to theAssembly last week  the Secretary-General set the toneof the annual general debate. My delegation commendshim for his tenacity and courage under extremepolitical circumstances and shares his overallassessment of the current international situation andthe role of the United Nations.20Just a little more than three weeks ago  on theinitiative of the member States of the Non-AlignedMovement  the Assembly reaffirmed the central role ofthe United Nations in the maintenance of internationalpeace and security and the promotion of internationalcooperation. It was  indeed  a reaffirmation that thisOrganization was founded on international cooperationand that its efficacy is rooted in internationalcooperation. My delegation therefore urges all MemberStates to adhere to the principle of cooperation.Sierra Leone believes  and will continue tobelieve in the United Nations. After all  we are part ofthe United Nations  like each and every Staterepresented in the General Assembly. Of course thereare some difficulties  but we strongly believe that given adequate resources and cooperative support in atimely manner and given the necessary moral andpolitical support  the United Nations can deliver  as ithas done admirably in Sierra Leone.In that connection  allow me to express oursincere appreciation to all the countries that havecontributed to the United Nations Mission in SierraLeone (UNAMSIL). Our thanks also go out to the staffof all the agencies and programmes of the UnitedNations family and the non-governmentalorganizations that have worked in partnership with theUnited Nations  the Government and civil society torestore peace and stability in our country and  mostrecently  to conduct local government elections.A theme that has reverberated within the Hall inthe past week  and in other international forums  is theobservance of the rule of law. The Secretary-General’sanalysis of its significance needs no embellishment.The causes and character of the conflict in SierraLeone  perhaps more than in any other country in theworld in recent times  tell us that nearly everythingcrumbles when the rule of law collapses and that therefore  it should be made the pillar of post-conflictreconstruction  national recovery  governance andadministration of justice and the cornerstone of lastingpeace.While the Government of Sierra Leone isstruggling  albeit with limited resources  to reform itsown administration of justice  it is also concernedabout the financial situation of the Special Court established in the country to address impunity. Theefficacy  and indeed the credibility of the Court  couldbe questioned unless urgent measures are taken toaddress its budgetary problems. I should therefore liketo take this opportunity to appeal for continuedvoluntary contributions  as well as the requestedsubventions from the regular budget of the UnitedNations for the Special Court.As President Kabbah said at the formal openingof the courthouse last March  it is“a Special Court for Sierra Leone  a symbol ofthe rule of law and an essential element in thepursuit of peace  justice and nationalreconciliation for the people of Sierra Leone. It isalso a Special Court for the internationalcommunity  a symbol of the rule of internationallaw.”There is no guarantee that the victims ofviolations of international humanitarian and humanrights law during the civil war in Sierra Leone willreceive reparation for those heinous crimes. So theleast we can do for them now is to ensure that justice isdone. We can do so by reducing the financial burden ofthe Special Court and by demonstrating that we areindeed serious about respect for the rule of law.The United Nations was formed over 50 yearsago as a response to the peace and security needs of theera of its birth. Since then  the world has experienced and continues to experience  fundamental changes  towhich the United Nations should adapt. That is whySierra Leoneans continue to follow with profoundinterest the consultative processes for the revitalizationof the General Assembly and reforms in the SecurityCouncil in order to reflect the reality of thecontemporary world. My delegation wishes to urge thePresident to sustain the momentum in the processesgenerated by the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly.The menace of terrorism and local conflictscontinues to impede peace  stability and developmentin many parts of the world. Innocent victims aside conflicts have reversed the development gains of poorcountries  and even reduced them to the status ofdonor-dependants. While deploring all acts ofterrorism  it is important to recognize that poorcountries  particularly those emerging from conflict have weak capacity to fight terrorism. If global actionis what is needed to fight terrorism  and my delegationbelieves that this should be the case  efforts should bemade to enhance the capacity of poor countries to playtheir own role in that battle.21After about 11 years of a violent and destructivecivil conflict  Sierra Leone is now in the delicate post-conflict phase. It is in that phase that the root causes ofthe conflict should be addressed and the foundation forpermanent peace  stability and sustainable developmentshould be laid. In short  that is the phase in which thegains of the peace effort should be maximized  using asynergetic approach that incorporates development andother strands of generators of peace into peacekeeping.But this approach needs resources and planning beyondthe traditional peacekeeping strategies that involvepulling out when the guns fall silent.It is in that regard that my delegation is solicitingcontinued and enhanced support for post-conflictSierra Leone. An important component of this appeal isthat development and financial institutions shouldunderstand the multifaceted demands and delicatecharacter of post-conflict situations and treat them asspecial cases. That means that those institutions shouldrevisit their rigid and standard prescriptions  with thepurpose of making them flexible and responsive to thespecial requirements of post-conflict situations.Ten days ago  the Security Council extended themandate of UNAMSIL to June 2005. The Governmentof Sierra Leone has endorsed the Secretary-General’sassessment and recommendations regarding thebenchmarks for the residual presence of UNAMSIL inthe country. We note in particular that  over the nextseveral months  the Security Council will review theresidual functions against the capacity of the SierraLeone armed forces and police to maintain security andstability effectively throughout the country. We hopethat the review will also take into consideration thesecurity situation in the subregion.I would like to reassure the internationalcommunity through the Assembly that we do notexpect UNAMSIL to remain in Sierra Leoneindefinitely. The Government of Sierra Leone isdetermined to ensure a smooth and seamless transitionfrom UNAMSIL to the Republic of Sierra LeoneArmed Forces and the police throughout the country.The restructured army and the police have alreadydemonstrated through training  discipline andperformance that they are nearly ready to assume fullresponsibility for the security and safety of the peopleof Sierra Leone. But training is only a part of the totalpicture of readiness. For effective operationalreadiness  both the army and the police need logisticalsupport and equipment. Accordingly  my delegationwishes to appeal to friendly nations for assistance toequip our security forces to enable them to functioneffectively. Meanwhile  for obvious reasons  theGovernment and people of Sierra Leone areencouraged by the prospects for consolidating thedeployment of the United Nations peacekeepingmission throughout neighbouring Liberia.Recent dialogue between  and among  the leadersof the Mano River Union also augur well for peace andstability in our subregion. We need the continuedsupport of the international community in resuscitatingthe objectives and programmes of the Mano RiverUnion  because  if fully functional  it can complementthe efforts of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations inthe subregion. In that connection  I would like toexpress our appreciation to the Secretary-General forhis encouragement of the rejuvenation process of theUnion.The United Nations has already identified manyof the root causes of armed conflict within States. Withthe assistance of the international community  effortsare being made to address those root causes. Theobjective is to prevent the recurrence of armedconflicts. My delegation believes that equal attentionshould also be paid to the root causes of armed conflictacross States  including the senseless acts ofinternational terrorism that are being perpetrated inmany parts of the world. While prompt  effective anddecisive measures are absolutely necessary to deal withthe phenomenon  it is about time that we try to identifyand address the root causes of such ignoble acts.New challenges are emerging and new threats arebeing hatched in various corners of our world withunprecedented frequency. However  we must not forgetthe old  unresolved challenges and threats to humansafety and security. Without prejudging the outcome ofthe Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change  Sierra Leone hopes that thePanel’s report will help to throw some light on theprobable link between what could be described as oldand still existing threats and those now beingcharacterized as new threats and challenges. Perhaps as President Kabbah suggested at the MillenniumSummit four years ago  the old and still existingchallenges are taking on a new form and newdimensions. What we are experiencing is  perhaps  thetransmutation of threats and challenges.22In speaking of old challenges and threats  thequestion of Palestine comes to mind. It has been on ouragenda for far too long. We know that that is a complexissue. However  the longer it remains unresolved  thegreater the risk of unending cycles of violence. SierraLeone firmly believes that an equitable solution  inparticular the establishment of an independentPalestinian State side by side with Israel within secureborders  would be a giant step towards peace andsecurity  not only in the Middle East but also in the restof our troubled and unsafe world.Still in the area of existing threats to internationalpeace and security  my delegation is disturbed by thetragic humanitarian situation in the Darfur region ofthe Sudan. We applaud the response of the AfricanUnion to the crisis and urge all stakeholders to dowhatever is necessary to speedily resolve the conflict.But let me emphasize that the African Union wouldlike to do more — and would do more if it had theresources. Accordingly  I would like to make an openappeal  on behalf of the African Union Commission for financial and material support for the AfricanUnion to enable it to deal with the situation.The Government and the people of Sierra Leoneknow from experience that ceasefire  disarmament demobilization and reintegration are essentialcomponents of peace. But we are still faced with thedaunting task of consolidating the peace  because peacegoes far beyond the process of the disarmament demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants. Theconsolidation of peace — real peace — meansimprovements in the lives and livelihoods of all ourpeople. It means jobs  food  education  health care adequate housing and other social services. As theSecretary-General observed in his most recent reporton the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone considerable progress has been made towardseconomic and social recovery. However  in order tosustain the process of consolidating peace and tofacilitate the smooth transition from recovery tosustainable development  Sierra Leone needs continuedsupport  particularly for vulnerable areas of thecountry.We look forward to the 2005 comprehensivereview of the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals — a review that will coincide withthe sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations. We inSierra Leone will also be reviewing the state of ourfood security goal of ensuring that by the end of 2007 no Sierra Leonean will go to bed hungry. Our foodsecurity goal must be seen in the context of one of theUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals namely  the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger.Given the grave consequences of extreme poverty andstarvation  those are realistic goals. They represent theminimum standard necessary to save lives. They areattainable.We know that it is our responsibility to do morefor ourselves. We also know the urgency of addressingthe democratic deficit in international economic andfinancial decision-making. In our interdependent andincreasingly globalizing world  economic and socialinequities within countries are a reflection of unfairrules  unfair trade practices and an uneven playingfield in international transactions. The Director-General of the International Labour Organization  JuanSomavia  was correct when he told the recent AfricanUnion summit in Ouagadougou that good nationalgovernance will not succeed unless we have goodglobal governance.Consumers need to share  in a more equitablemanner with producers in the developing world  thebenefits derived from their abundant natural andhuman resources. That means  among other things  fairprices and debt relief  all of which should have apositive impact on our capacity to reduce povertywithin our respective developing countries."
"155",6315,"SLV",59,2004,"Itis my great honour to represent the Salvadoran peopleas I address the United Nations  the supreme globalforum  for the first time.I wish to convey my sincerest congratulations toyou  Sir  on your election to coordinate the work of thissession. We also thank Mr. Julian Hunte for hisoutstanding leadership of the last session of theGeneral Assembly.To the Secretary-General  we reiterate ouradmiration and our respect for his leadership in thefulfilment of the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations Charter at a time when the Organization isconfronting growing and complex global challengesaffecting international peace and security.Internal and international conflicts  terrorism andtransnational organized crime  the persistence ofextreme poverty  environmental deterioration andunresolved development problems are global in natureand require a harmonizing centre that can support theefforts of the international community to find sharedand consensual solutions in order to establish aninternational order that responds to the needs andaspirations of humankind.That integrating centre must be the UnitedNations. We therefore support the establishment of thepanel of eminent persons to make recommendations oncollective security and the strengthening ofmultilateralism in order more effectively to confrontglobal challenges.Irrational and criminal terrorist acts havehighlighted the need for us to unite in our efforts andour determination  regardless of the differences thatmay exist among States  to unify our views and adoptcollective action to find ways to confront thephenomenon and its causes  in the framework ofrespect for international law.The delegation of El Salvador reaffirms its fullconviction that global terrorism is not an issue betweencultures or nations. From that perspective  theGovernment of El Salvador has decided to respond tothe United Nations appeal by participating in the workof reconstruction and humanitarian assistance in Iraq.By its very nature  our presence in Iraq deservesan additional explanation. We are not there for militaryreasons. Ours is a considered response to the appeallaunched by this Organization for the internationalcommunity to help in the transition phase leading tothe full establishment of authority based on the freewill of the Iraqi people  with absolute respect for itsterritorial integrity  its own culture and itsunquestionable right to define its own destiny.El Salvador suffered a long internal war andsucceeded  with the support of the internationalcommunity and the United Nations  in achievinglasting peace. We believe that the time has come tomake our testimony and accumulated experience  bothduring the political negotiations for peace and thepeace-building phase  available to other peoples.El Salvador reiterates its firm and resolutesupport for peace-building and peacekeepingoperations  above all because we have enjoyed thebenefits of such an operation  but also  of course because of their positive results in various regions of14the world. On the basis of that conviction  our countryhas signed a memorandum of understanding with theUnited Nations  the best evidence of El Salvador’scommitment to such activities  which are so necessaryin today’s complex and unquiet world. We havepresented a list of resources that are available to theworld Organization as a basis for our participation infuture operations  in addition to those in which we arealready participating.In that context  in order to demonstrate our spiritof cooperation on these issues  I am pleased toannounce my Government’s interest in submitting itscandidacy for a non-permanent seat on the SecurityCouncil so as to make our accumulated experienceavailable to this Organization.Since the successful conclusion of our internalconflict  El Salvador has focused its attentionresolutely on human development. The Government Ilead  by dint of a broad majority vote of the Salvadoranpeople on 1 June  is one of openness and inclusion with a vision of national integration and service to theinterests and aspirations of our people. Such vitalquestions as security  employment  the effectiveimprovement of basic services and the productivity ofour communities and regions are the top priorities ofour governing programme.We are focusing on transforming nationaleducation  on reshaping public health care  onsignificantly strengthening the rule of law  oncombating crime in all its manifestations and at alllevels  on reactivating the economy and on makingSalvadoran society internationally competitive. Insofaras we achieve greater progress domestically  we will becompetitive externally.In addition  however  we are working on a socialplan geared towards reducing extreme poverty in thenext five years. To that end  we are undertaking a taxreform that will increase tax collection and reduceevasion  allowing us to obtain the additional fundsnecessary to implementing our social plan. We shalllevy a special tax on tobacco  alcohol  weapons andammunition in order to promote a special health carefund with which we will expand health assistance tothe rural areas of our country and undermine the blackmarket in those goods.In the approximately 100 days that we have beenin office  we have undertaken important health reformsby extending medical coverage to the age of 12 for thechildren of workers who contribute to Salvadoransocial security and by granting emergency paediatricservices to almost 400 000 boys and girls.We know that no Government effort will beeffective without the cooperation of all sectors in ourcountry. We are therefore launching a mechanism ofunderstanding with all our political and social forces.In that context  we have established an employmentagreement that seeks solutions  together with privateenterprise  for strengthening the agriculture construction  tourism and micro-  small and medium-sized business sectors  with the aim of generating morejobs.One of the best mechanisms for increasing ourdevelopment potential is investment in education. Inthat awareness  we have launched the NationalEducation Plan 2021  which seeks to reinvigorate ourvision of the future of education through short- medium- and long-term programmes. We hope that ournational effort will also enjoy internationalcooperation. That is why we were pleased by thedecision taken by the Government of Spain to provideassistance for primary education.The most urgent of the challenges confrontingSalvadoran society is that of providing security to ourcitizens. In order to meet that need  we recentlyestablished a rural police force  along with auncompromising plan to eradicate delinquency inurban areas overrun by gangs. The plan also offersspecial programmes for young people who wish toabandon the path of crime.El Salvador unreservedly shares the interestsexpressed at the International Conference on Financingfor Development. We reiterate our dedication toseeking alternative ways and means and renewedcommitments to making the fight on poverty moreeffective — an objective that is interlinked with peaceand security in the modern world.In that vein  we welcome the initiative of Brazil France  Chile and Spain confirming the need  in thefight against hunger and poverty  for greater and moreeffective efforts to place stability and global securityon a solid foundation. If we all apply our will andcommitment  we can develop new programmes andidentify innovative public policies that will allow us toachieve the Millennium Goals.15Throughout its history  El Salvador has been acountry of emigration. The flow of emigration wasintensified by the war  and today virtually one third ofour population lives abroad. Maintaining anddeepening links with the country of origin is one of themain policies of our administration. Our nationalreality requires us to integrate the views of Salvadoransabroad with local expectations. The economic impactof this phenomenon is decisive to our life as a nation but equally or even more important is the sociologicaland cultural impact of the situation. The phenomenonof transculturization experienced by our society ischanging El Salvador forever.The contribution of migrants to their countries oforigin and to their host countries deserves specialattention from the international community  andparticularly from the specialized agencies of the UnitedNations system. The transfer of remittances is a keyelement in the mobilization of resources for theeradication of poverty and the attainment of theMillennium Goals. The reduction of the cost ofremittances should be a concern of the internationalcommunity. From that standpoint  I am pleased toexpress our great interest in participating actively inthe high-level dialogue on international migration anddevelopment  to be held in 2006.We welcome the United States proposal to createa fund for democracy. In the same vein  El Salvadorwelcomes the General Assembly’s proclamation of2005 as the International Year of Microcredit. Theproclamation can promote the strengthening of micro- small and medium-sized enterprises  which represent abroad spectrum of the social fabric and help sustainnational progress.In today’s world  globalization has put us all onthe map of international reality. It promotes thedynamic of strategic alliances in trade and all otherfields  and makes it possible to build models fordevelopment by comparing them with otherexperiences. Gradually and in a balanced manner  wehave decided to strengthen our links of cooperationwith various developed countries. The prevailingregionalization makes us all dependent on one another.In the case of countries such as ours  the situation leadsus to nurture our energies and creativity  open markets promote financial flows  facilitate the transfer oftechnology and encourage competitiveness. These aremajor opportunities and challenges that we must allaccept.While cooperation for development remainsfundamental  El Salvador reiterates the urgent need fora system of multilateral trade that is open  fair  rule-based  foreseeable and non-discriminatory  inaccordance with the objectives of the MillenniumDeclaration.In a world that is becoming increasinglyglobalized and therefore increasingly interdependent economic phenomena affect us all in a chain reaction.The current international energy situation has asignificant impact on the economies of our countries with a negative effect on the dynamics of growth andprogress. Thus  from this United Nations rostrum westrongly urge that we explore  as an organizedcommunity  not only short-term avenues forovercoming the crises  but also structural remedies thatcan help the most vulnerable countries  in particular. Itis contradictory to talk about combating poverty andhunger while the consumer countries are paying suchhigh prices for petroleum.The complex Palestinian-Israeli conflict is asource of enormous concern to our country  given theincessant violence  the lack of control over terroristgroups and the ever-growing difficulty of returning todialogue and political understanding. Our countryreiterates  as it has done consistently  its support forany effort and measure to open space for a negotiatedpolitical solution that takes into account the legitimateinterests of the parties directly involved.As for the Republic of China on Taiwan  that is acase which the community of nations must examine inthe light of international realities. Resolution 2758(XXVI) of 1971 did not resolve the issue of therepresentation of the Taiwanese people in the UnitedNations. That nation has developed politically economically and socially in an independent  free anddemocratic way. It has its own institutions andcharacteristics  just like any other State of theinternational community. However  Taiwan’s situationin the international community is exceptional  becauseits absence from this forum is a denial of the exerciseof the rights that are recognized to other peoples and ofthe universal and democratic nature of ourOrganization. Our delegation therefore supportsconsideration of the exceptional situation of thepopulation of the Republic of China on Taiwan and itseventual participation in this forum and otherinternational organizations.16Our Organization has played  is playing and willcontinue to play a decisive role in maintaining theworld’s healthy balance. Reality is changingconstantly. Many things have been left behind andmany things await us. Institutions in all areas and at alllevels must evolve with the changing times. In thatvein  we associate ourselves with those who arecommitted to the structural renewal of the UnitedNations. We believe that such reform must encompassthe highest structures  including the Security Council.Every year  the nations of the world  through theirrepresentatives  attend this rendezvous with the destinyof the world. We have the responsibility to do nothingless than to build a better world for current and futuregenerations. Every word  every gesture and everydecision made or reached here must be aimed at thatlofty purpose. Only if we combine our efforts can anew  safer  fairer  more peaceful and more sharingreality emerge. Together with all the nationsrepresented here  El Salvador takes up the challenge ofjoining in that concert of constructive wills  in theconfidence that the god of nations will illuminate andencourage us so that we may fulfil his will for peaceand brotherhood in a world in which no one is leftbehind."
"156",6340,"SMR",59,2004,"At the outset I would like to express my great and profoundsatisfaction for the recent release of four hostageskidnapped in Iraq  among them a young woman whosemother is a San Marino national engaged inhumanitarian activities for the Iraqi civilian population.On behalf of the Government of San Marino I wishwholeheartedly to thank the Government of Italy which played an active role in the release  as well as allof those who made that release possible.On behalf of the Government of the Republic ofSan Marino I wish to congratulate Mr. Jean Ping Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon  on his electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession. I also wish to thank the outgoing President Mr. Julian Hunte  for the total commitment anddetermination he showed in his work.United Nations activities have thus far beencrucial in reducing conflicts between States. However although the number of international conflicts hasdecreased  mankind is still facing new threats  whichcan only be tackled multilaterally. So that it cancontinue to serve the international community  theUnited Nations should be given more effective tools toenhance mediation and peaceful settlement of disputes preventive control  verification  planning and use ofsanctions  in order to prevent the outbreak of warfareand to promote disarmament and arms control.Moreover  the United Nations must receive adequatesupport so that it can better meet the growing numberof requests for peacekeeping operations in variousregions of the world. In that context  we appreciate theresults obtained so far  but the process requires astronger will on behalf of our Governments to complywith international rules and implement a concrete andeffective cooperation regime.In line with relevant international standards  SanMarino has recently passed a special law to combatterrorism and associated crimes. It is also activelycooperating with the two United Nations anti-terrorismcommittees established pursuant to Security Councilresolutions 1267 (1999) and 1373 (2001).Since the tragic 11 September attacks on theUnited States of America  the international communityhas become aware of the seriousness of the threat ofterrorism. Recurrent dramatic events worldwide  theviolent attacks perpetrated in Iraq — not only againstsoldiers but also civilians  the media and  mostrecently  even volunteers of non-governmentalorganization humanitarian missions — force ourcountries to realize the full scope of this phenomenonand its proliferation  and the need to search for a5common and effective response based on a strongerjoint commitment.The horrifying terrorist act carried out in Ossetiaagainst hundreds of innocents and so many childrendemonstrates that the widespread strategy of fear hatred and devastation is humanly and ethicallyunacceptable.San Marino once again condemns any form ofterrorism  the most serious and impending threat topeace  for which there can be neither explanation norjustification. We support the search for constructivesolutions that promote dialogue and mutualunderstanding among peoples of different cultures andreligions with a view to the dissemination of anincreasingly shared culture of peace and cooperationthat will help to reject violence and oppression.The Government of San Marino avails itself ofthis opportunity to express its special thanks to theSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General  Mr. LakhdarBrahimi  who contributed to the establishment of anIraqi interim Government  and renews its support toPrime Minister Allawi for the forthcoming democraticelections scheduled for January 2005. The electionswill surely be a milestone for the Iraqi people in theexercise of their sovereignty.We trust that the international community willhelp to achieve national reconciliation in Iraq  on thebasis of Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) of8 June  with regard to independence  security andlegality. Despite the tragic attack on its headquarters inBaghdad last year  the United Nations can continue toplay a key role in Iraq  especially at a time when thesituation has become extremely complex and delicate particularly from a human and political point of view.Another major source of concern anddisappointment for San Marino is the persistence of theMiddle East crisis  which remains unsolved despite theefforts made by the United Nations to encouragedialogue and indispensable mediation.To achieve the ultimate goal of legitimate peaceful and safe coexistence of two States  Israel andPalestine  the political process outlined in the road mapand supported by the international community stillappears to be the only viable solution. Therefore  onbehalf of the San Marino Government  I reiterate  as Irecently expressed to both the Foreign Ministers ofIsrael and Palestine  our sincere hope that such aprocess will soon resume.With regard to the reform of the SecurityCouncil  the position of the Republic of San Marino iswell known. We favour an increase in the number ofnon-permanent members  in the most appropriate way and of the gradual restriction of the right of veto  witha view to its eventual elimination. Indeed  the increaseof the number of permanent seats and the extension ofthe right of veto would entail  in our view  a greaterinjustice through the perpetuation of privileges  theconsolidation of discrimination within United NationsMember States  and it would limit the power of theGeneral Assembly to elect the most suitable candidatesin accordance with differing historical periods.The Government of San Marino fully endorsesGeneral Assembly resolution 58/316  adopted on 1 July2004  relating to the revitalization of the work of theAssembly itself. Similarly  we are satisfied withresolution 58/314  adopted on the same day  grantingthe Holy See wider and more incisive prerogatives asan Observer.The safeguarding of human rights andfundamental freedoms  together with full respect forfreedom  equality and democracy  have always beenessential elements in the history of San Marino  andrepresent the very basis of its 1 700-year existence.These issues continue to regulate relations with otherStates and with international organizations. It is in thisspirit that I express my best wishes once again toMs. Louise Arbour  the recently appointed UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights.San Marino firmly believes in the role of theInternational Criminal Court (ICC) and has recentlysupported the draft ICC/United Nations relationshipagreement and the setting up of an ICC liaison office inNew York.My country remains strongly committed to thecampaign for the universal abolition of the deathpenalty  and it has recently ratified the SecondOptional Protocol to the International Covenant onCivil and Political Rights on the abolition of the deathpenalty.The recent signature and ratification by SanMarino of the United Nations Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen has been followed by a law granting fullgender equality in the transmission of San Marinocitizenship to children. Moreover  the Government hassubsequently established for the first time in history aMinistry for Equal Opportunity.6As 2004 is the International Year of the Family we hope that as many countries as possible will followSan Marino in signing the two Optional Protocols tothe Convention on the Rights of the Child  which areon the involvement of children in armed conflict; andon the sale of children  child prostitution and childpornography. In addition  San Marino recently ratifiedthe 1993 Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption thus starting a wide debate domestically on jointparental custody in case of parental separation.Equal attention is being paid by my country to themost disadvantaged members of our families andsocieties and to the issue of the increasing ageing ofthe population  observed especially in developedcountries. Against this background  our Governmenthas been working to strengthen existing supportinfrastructures and assistance to families.We sincerely hope soon to reach an agreement onthe final text of an international convention on thepromotion and protection of the rights and dignity ofdisabled people.The President took the Chair.San Marino also wishes to underline therelevance of the objectives set forth in the MonterreyConsensus  especially considering that 14 millionpeople  including 6 million children  are still dying ofstarvation. One billion people have no access topotable water  and 3 billion human beings do notreceive adequate medical care.Yet  poverty eradication cannot be implementedwithout respect for the ecosystem. In this regard  avaluable instrument to develop and protect ourenvironment is  in our opinion  the Convention toCombat Desertification  recently ratified by SanMarino  along with a view to actively participate in theInternational Decade for Action  “Water for Life” 2005-2015.In accordance with the objectives of health forall  San Marino recently ratified the World HealthOrganization Framework Convention on TobaccoControl and reiterates its support to the implementationof the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS  withthe awareness that the spreading of new epidemicsrequires stronger international cooperation.On this important occasion  year after yearmeeting and exchanging views as representatives ofour respective Governments  we express deeper anddeeper concern and frustration vis-à-vis the manythreats severely affecting humankind and possiblyjeopardizing our common future.Yet  the ideals and principles we reaffirmed in theMillennium Declaration are still the highest benchmarkto guide our efforts  both within our own States andwithin the work of the United Nations. We need toinstil hope and actualize our universal aspirations topeace  cooperation and development.To this end  let me express my best and warmestwishes to you  Mr. President  to the Secretary-General to all United Nations officials and to all our countries."
"157",6415,"STP",59,2004,"AsFrench is the most widely recognized official languagein the Central Africa subregion  I should like to beginmy statement by addressing a few words to theAssembly in that common language.I would like to say how pleased I am to be herewith you today  Mr. President — you in your capacityas the President of the General Assembly and me inmine as President of my country. I am also pleased toaddress the Assembly in order to speak on behalf of thepeople of Sao Tome and Principe.I shall now deliver my address in Portuguese —which  as the Assembly is aware  is the officiallanguage of Sao Tome and Principe.(spoke in Portuguese; English text furnished by thedelegation)Allow me  at the outset  to congratulate you mostwarmly  Mr. President  on your election as President ofthe fifty-ninth session on the General Assembly  whoseproceedings will undoubtedly benefit from yourpersonal qualities and your experience in internationalrelations. Gabon and my country  Sao Tome andPrincipe  have long enjoyed a very good relationship ofcooperation at various levels  and my delegationwishes you success in your new functions.May I also thank the President’s predecessor President Julian Robert Hunte of Saint Lucia  for theexcellent work he has done.On behalf of people of Sao Tome and Principe  Iwould like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General forhis relentless efforts and dedication at the service ofthe goals of the United Nations  and for his work inpromoting peace and development.This session of the General Assembly is takingplace during a particularly complex internationalsituation. Violence and the violation of human rightsare increasing. The United Nations must play its role asa matter of priority; otherwise world order couldcollapse. More than ever before  Governments mustgive a universal forum like this the responsibility torebuild international order on the basis of peace 2respect for human rights  security and cooperation fordevelopment. Unilateralism must be put aside. We haveto work together for a better world.Intolerance  terrorism  occupation  discrimination organized crime and social injustice are some of thesources of today’s open conflicts. Religious differencesand drug trafficking in some countries are drivingpeople to high levels of violence and destruction. Wethe people the United Nations have to do our best tostop those atrocities  or unprotected groups of societywill disappear and the spiral of violence could spreadout of control.Darfur is an example of discrimination andatrocity. We call on Sudan’s Government to fulfil allthe provisions contained in Security Council resolution1556 (2004)  which was adopted on 30 July.It is completely unacceptable that 50 millionpeople worldwide have become refugees or have beeninternally displaced as a result of having been drivenfrom their homes by war  persecution and human rightsabuses. We now needed concrete action by leaders andpeoples to ensure that the perpetrators of criminalbehaviour are brought to justice  thereby rebuildingconfidence among peoples and nations  but especiallyto address the root causes of violence.Small island States will meet in Mauritius toassess the progress made since the Global Conferenceon the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States  which was held in Barbados.Progress in the implantation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action has been mixed. At Mauritius key issues will be reviewed and decisions andrecommendations will be made with regard to thequestions of climate change  natural and environmentaldisasters  fresh water  land resources  wastemanagement  tourism  energy  transport  biodiversityand coastal and marine resources. All those are issuesaffecting the ecosystems of small islands as a result ofglobal warming. They can only be solved gradually andif the international community increases resourceseffectively to support the sustainable development ofsmall island States. We would like to take thisopportunity to thank the international community foreverything it has done to date. I would like to extend aspecial thanks to the Government of Mauritius for itsefforts to organize the special international conference.As an island nation  Sao Tome and Principecontinues to see its very existence threatened by globalwarming. Our shorelines are eroding and our nationalterritory is shrinking as the seas rise. Is my smallcountry to end up nothing but a tiny volcanic peaksticking out above the waves  with the last of ourpeople clinging to the land left unclaimed by the risingsea? The Kyoto Protocol must be implemented by allfor the benefit of all.The Governments of Africa launched the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  aimingspecifically at optimally mobilizing both African andinternational resources and at harmonizingcontributions through a partnership based on mutualcommitments and balanced interests and responsibilities.Peace  good governance  security and development arechallenges that all African Governments and peopleshave to face. They must create the conditions toachieve those goals. Those goals are far from beingreached  given the numerous conflicts and the destructiveand negatives effects of conflicts. My Government willcontinuously support NEPAD and will work to createthe foundations for its implementation.Most countries continue to face the challenge ofHIV/AIDS and other diseases. In some parts of AfricaHIV/AIDS is devastating entire families  societies cultures and economies. Treatment is still expensive and our economy has started to feel the negative effectsof the disease. Unless there are additional resources andscientific investment to find a cure for HIV/AIDS  hopefor progress in Africa will continue to be far from reach.It is not only health problems that afflict poorcountries. Globalization affects some because few haveall the necessary conditions to develop trade andcommerce and to take advantage of new technologies.The latest efforts by the World Trade Organization inGeneva are an example of the fact that those who havetoo much could make a difference by giving away alittle to poor countries. If that is not done  we willcontinue to face discriminatory tariffs and toexperience erosion in quality of life.My country regrets that international relations insome parts of the world have deteriorated to the pointwhere extreme violence  destruction and violation ofhuman rights and the environment are daily facts oflife  and where the use and abuse of dangerousweapons is endemic. We also regret that refugees andchildren are among the targets in those conflicts.Tragedies cannot be our destiny. Tragedies andnatural disasters such as the ones we face in Iraq  the3Middle East  Bangladesh and some countries in Africaand elsewhere are testimony of the fact that mankind ismoving towards facing bigger challenges. MyGovernment thinks that multilateralism under theframework of the United Nations is the only way forthe international community to be able to achievelasting peace and development.Terrorism around the world is causingdestruction  destabilizing Governments and killingpeople in places such as Madrid  the Middle East andelsewhere. We are confronted by a dilemma  becausethus far all the strategies employed to fight this scourgeare not producing significant results. Under theauthority of the Security Council  we must guaranteethe universality of  and compliance with  non-proliferation treaties.My Government supports the recommendationsof Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Timor-Leste. TheUnited Nations Mission of Support in East Timor is asuccess we cannot ignore.The universality of the Organization must be a fact and all countries have to be represented. Taiwan is notrepresented. We call upon the international communityto address the issue of Taiwan’s representation. Despiteits small size  Taiwan offers development aid to a largenumber of countries. Taiwan has all the elements to be anactive member of the main international organizations. Alook at its economy  trade relations  commerce finance  application of new technologies and supportfor many countries reveals facts that we cannot ignoreany longer.We would also like to refer to Cuba. Economicembargo is a severe sanction. It violates the Charter ofthe United Nations and international law. I would liketo request that the General Assembly lend its assistanceto bring about an end to the economic embargo againstCuba. The cold war era is behind us  and a people inneed simply cannot continue to be the object of thepolitical interest of part of the electorate in Florida.In Sao Tome and Principe we are working veryhard to consolidate our young democracy and to createa solid foundation for sound development. Followingthe agreement signed among the Government  theinternational community and the military — whichmounted a coup in Sao Tome and Principe in 2003 —we organized a national forum that brought allsegments of our society to the table to bring their viewscloser together and to draw up recommendations inorder to avoid more instability in the country.On the economic front  we are preparing thecountry for a new era based on oil exploration andproduction. Our National Assembly has adopted a lawon the management of the revenues that we willeventually receive from oil companies. That shows thatcorruption will be fought  that the new generation willbe protected and that the country will have enoughresources for development.The Government and the people of Sao Tome andPrincipe adhere to the principles of respect for thesovereignty of all countries and following the path ofdialogue  tolerance and mutual understanding amongpeoples. We call on all members of the United Nationsto do likewise for the sake of a better world.I would like to conclude by expressing ourgratitude to all countries Members of the UnitedNations for the support given to our country at the timeof the first-ever coup d’état in Sao Tome and Principe in June 2003. I would also like to thank all the countriesof Central Africa — including Congo (Brazzaville) which currently presides over the EconomicCommunity of Central African States — for everythingthey have done. I also wish to thank the President ofthe General Assembly and our partners in CentralAfrica and the African Union for their tireless efforts."
"158",6456,"SUR",59,2004,"On behalf of theGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname  Iextend to you my sincere congratulations on yourunanimous election to guide the work of this fifty-ninthsession of the United Nations General Assembly. Weare convinced that the wealth of diplomatic experienceand expertise you bring to this body will assist you in ameaningful way during your presidency. I can assureyou that the Government of the Republic of Surinameand its Permanent Mission stand ready to cooperatewith you in the coming months. It also gives me greatpleasure to salute your predecessor  the President of thefifty-eighth session of the General Assembly Mr. Julian Robert Hunte  a fellow Caribbean national.Mr. Hunte’s sterling and dedicated leadership has madeall of us  especially those from the Caribbean region proud. To Secretary-General Kofi Annan we offer ourcontinued support. We acknowledge the importance ofhis remarks at the start of the General Assembly andshare his views regarding the application of the rule oflaw  both domestically and internationally  as theguiding principle in strengthening and preservingdemocracy  defending and promoting human rights andestablishing peace.We are keenly aware of the importance of theUnited Nations  as the supreme multilateral institution in advancing multilateral diplomacy for the benefit ofhumanity in a world in which we continue to struggleto achieve peace  security and prosperity. Theinternational community expressed some time ago theneed for a more effective and efficient Organizationthat would be better able to address the manychallenges our world faces today.Under the inspiring leadership of yourpredecessor  Mr. President  the fifty-eighth session ofthe General Assembly achieved the reordering of theagenda of the General Assembly aimed at its furtherrationalization and at facilitating the uniform andcoherent discussion of development issues in theplenary and the main committees of the GeneralAssembly. We must keep that powerful momentum forchange alive and take it a step further. We must ensurethat we do not regress from the results achieved andensure that there is continued progress in these areas.The reform of the United Nations SecurityCouncil remains one of the vital objectives of therestructuring efforts of the Organization. In our view  arestructured Council must be a reflection of themembership of the Organization  improving its level oftransparency and making it more democratic. TheCouncil must be more inclusive and comprehensive inits functioning  as security matters  because of theirmultidimensional nature  affect the life and livelihoodof each and every one of us. The membership of arestructured Council and  equally  its currentcomposition must ensure that the Council upholds thefundamental principles of the Charter while retainingits main focus: the maintenance of international peaceand security.It is very disturbing to observe that  despiteintensive diplomatic and political undertakings  peaceand tranquillity in several regions of the world are stilla major concern and challenge that threaten thedemocratic underpinnings of society. The time may beopportune for the United Nations to spearhead theprocess of involving relevant interest groups and civilsociety at large in the different countries of a particularregion to assist in the establishment of sustained peacein that region.12We express our concern about the ongoingpolitical difficulties in the Middle East and in Africa resulting in violence and the displacement of manypersons.The political crises in our own hemisphere —especially in Venezuela and Haiti — have attractedmuch attention and have been the subject of manyefforts by the United Nations and the Organization ofAmerican States. We look forward to continuing andsustainable political stability in Venezuela which  wehope  will promote an environment of normalcy andprogress.The political situation in our sister nation  theRepublic of Haiti  remains of great concern. Since itsinception as the first black independent republic  Haitihas become the symbol of struggle and hardship  butalso of courage  survival and solidarity. That long-battered country and its population need moreprofound  constructive and long-term assistance toimprove the living conditions of the people of Haiti.Earlier  I referred briefly to the multidimensionalnature of security and the need to give due attention tosocial  economic and environmental threats. In recentweeks  the Caribbean region  which is home toeconomies that are already vulnerable  has felt theforce of nature in the most extreme manner. Whileseveral countries have been battered — such asJamaica  the Bahamas  Saint Vincent and theGrenadines  Barbados  Trinidad and Tobago andseveral other islands — one country in particular hasbeen severely damaged: Grenada. I join all the othernations that have already done so in calling forimmediate as well as long-term financial and technicalassistance for the Government and people of Grenada.The Government of Suriname offers it condolences tothe families of the victims in Caribbean countries  aswell as in affected states of the United States ofAmerica  where various hurricanes in recent weekshave caused considerable damage and loss of life.Another global threat that has an impact on everycountry emanates from the activities of terrorists terrorist groups and State-sponsored terrorism. Theworld will never forget the images of horrifyingterrorist acts such as the one that took place in Beslanthis year  where hundreds of persons  mostly children lost their lives. The Government of Suriname remainscommitted to the fight against terrorism. We alsocontinue to believe that an effective and successfulbattle can be waged through a comprehensiveapproach.The High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges andChange  which was established by the Secretary-General with a view to receiving a global report oninternational security  is a result of the renewed interestin international security concerns. We hope that thatreview will be one that will produce result-orientedobjectives and measures.Suriname believes that development issues suchas the eradication of poverty and hunger and theprotection of the environment are among the extremelyimportant aspects to be addressed if one wishes toobtain lasting and comprehensive security  whichencompasses  inter alia  military  political environmental  economic and social developmentalaspects.Up to the present day  globalization has notdelivered on the promise of vast developmentopportunities on a global scale. While we have toacknowledge that globalization has createdopportunities  those opportunities have been restrictedto just a few societies. The opportunities that arisefrom development in the world today are unfortunately  not within the reach of all humankind.The current world order is still characterized byeconomic disparities  unequal trade regimes  incomeinequalities between and within countries  socialinjustice and declining opportunities for hundreds ofmillions. Globalization can only become a real optionfor economic development if it becomes all-inclusiveand if we give it a human face by paying particularattention to the negative impact it has on socialprogress.Suriname continues to believe that the UnitedNations must regain its importance in the areas ofglobal development  if we want to be successful in ourefforts to eradicate poverty  achieve social andeconomic development and stem the spread ofcommunicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS.The meeting on the subject of poverty organizedby the Government of Brazil under the auspices of theUnited Nations points to a common awareness of thefact that the global development agenda must beadvanced and that  therefore  the internationalcommunity must move from political will to action andfrom commitments to implementation  grantinghumanity as a whole an opportunity to develop.13The upcoming 10-year review of the BarbadosProgramme of Action will provide small islanddeveloping States with a momentous opportunity topromote their priority interests and concerns for thenext phase of the implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action. While we anticipate that thatcomprehensive review will result in concrete proposalsto advance the implementation process  we also expectthat the review exercise will take place in a spirit ofpartnership. The upcoming meeting in Mauritiusshould therefore generate greatly needed support genuine commitment and  moreover  the political willof all partners in the process of furthering the cause ofachieving true benefits and progress for the manypeople living in small island developing States.In conclusion  I want to stress the need for theUnited Nations to become more effective in dealingwith the current challenges in terms of terrorism andsecurity. At the same time  we must remain vigilant indefending and strengthening democracy anddemocratic values and institutions  so as to create astable political and social environment for progress andsustainable development. We also need to continue and intensify  our battle against HIV/AIDS  illegal drugtrafficking and crime. Although globalization hasopened up opportunities  it is also our collectiveresponsibility to ensure that international tradeliberalization does not result in social and economicmarginalization  especially of smaller and vulnerableeconomies.To achieve those objectives  the United Nationshas to continue its restructuring process and becomenot only the principal global platform in theory  butalso demonstrate its capabilities to act in practice. It isin that context that my Government considers theUnited Nations the most appropriate global multilateralinstitution for the advancement of the living standardsof humankind as a whole and for achieving sustainableglobal peace and security."
"159",6480,"SVK",59,2004,"Let me beginby congratulating you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession. I am convinced that your work in thatimportant post will ensure further progress towards theattainment of our common goals. I wish you thegreatest of success and pledge the full support of ourdelegation. I should also like to take this opportunity tothank your predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  Minister forForeign Affairs of Saint Lucia  for his excellent workand  above all  for his personal contribution to therevitalization of the General Assembly.This is the first time that the Slovak Republic hasparticipated in the general debate of the GeneralAssembly as a member of the European Union (EU).Slovakia fully endorses the position set out earlier bythe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of theNetherlands on behalf of the EU. I am convinced thatthe enlarged EU will further strengthen its constructivepartnership with the United Nations.The international community is now facingchallenges and threats that were unknown when theCharter of the United Nations was drafted. Themultilateral mechanisms set out in the previous centuryhave proved to be less than adequate. Recent globalevents ó accompanied by an increase in new andpotentially more dangerous and destructive threats -have clearly demonstrated that no country can copewith security issues single-handedly  let alone tacklethem over the long term. There is now a greater needthan ever before for international solidarity  togetherwith a sense of responsibility on the part of all United17Nations Member States for consolidating peace andstability.The Slovak Republic is convinced that amultilateral approach is the best response to emergingthreats  and that the role of the United Nations inmaintaining global security is irreplaceable. Inaddition  we agree with the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  that the United Nations can maintainsuch a status only if it is able to carry out its basicfunctions effectively  embark upon internal reform andadapt to current conditions. To that end  the only wayforward involves strengthening the authority of UnitedNations institutions by making their work anddecision-making mechanisms more efficient. That iswhy we have welcomed the establishment of the High-Level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change. Itswork will undoubtedly rank among the most importantcontributions made towards reform in the history of theUnited Nations. We believe that that team of eminentpersonalities will provide a realistic definition of howthe United Nations can contribute to global securityand development. Slovakia will help to turn thoseobjectives into reality.We perceive the issue of reforming the SecurityCouncil in the same light. Reform should involve notonly enlarging the Security Council  but also makingits working methods and the implementation of itsdecisions more efficient. The Slovak Republiccontinues to support the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil with both permanent and non-permanentmembers  with the aim of ensuring a balanced regionaldistribution of seats  including greater representationfor the Eastern European region.In addition  I am confident that this session of theGeneral Assembly will help to build a global securitysystem by strengthening and consolidating the anti-terrorism coalition under the auspices of the UnitedNations  along with the Counter-Terrorism Committeeof the Security Council.Continuing terrorist attacks are leading tosignificant changes in the area of global security.Terrorists do not shy away from perpetrating thecruellest and most bestial of acts; nor ó as the recentevents in Beslan have shown ó do they hesitate to takethe lives of innocent children. Terrorism poses a threatto everyone; no one can be neutral or indifferent. It isnecessary that we be resolute and jointly mobilize ourefforts in combating it.The Governments of Member States must fightmore effectively against this inhuman phenomenonthrough mutual support  the implementation ofinternational law and improved cooperation betweeninternational and regional organizations. The 12 UnitedNations anti-terrorism conventions and protocols are ofthe utmost importance in the fight against terrorism and the Organization must continue to play a key rolein bolstering legal instruments in that battle. TheSlovak Republic supports the prompt approval of acomprehensive convention against terrorism as awhole  along with a convention aimed at averting actsof nuclear terrorism.Maintaining international peace and security hasalways been one of the Slovakiaís main priorities. Wehave long contributed military units  observers andequipment to United Nations peacekeeping missions.Since our accession to the United Nations  in January1993  we have participated in 14 Organization-ledmissions  ranging from military observer missions tohumanitarian and demining operations to peacekeepingduties.Since the beginning of the 1990s  the SlovakRepublic has dedicated itself both militarily andpolitically to the peace process in the Balkans.Nonetheless  Slovakia has never abandoned its effortsto help bring reconciliation and humanitarian aid toother parts of the world. We have gained respect forour participation in United Nations peacekeepingmissions in Africa and the Middle East.Slovakia also contributes to the training ofpeacekeeping forces. In line with General Assemblyresolutions  the Slovak Government sponsored aUnited Nations seminar held in the Slovak Republiclast May  which was attended by a wide range ofdelegates from more than 70 Member States. Theseminar discussed the conclusions of the Brahimireport (A/55/305)  which highlighted the importance ofstandardized training for United Nations peacekeepingmissions.In recent years  the number of attacks on UnitedNations personnel has increased alarmingly. Slovakiais a signatory to the Convention on the Safety ofUnited Nations and Associated Personnel and appealsto all those countries that have not yet done so toendorse that important international legal instrument 18which guarantees the protection of United Nationsstaff.Stabilizing the Western Balkans is a globalpriority and has a direct effect on the stability ofEurope. For that reason  it is also one of Slovakiaísforeign policy priorities. We have fully supported theactivities of the United Nations to date in using itsauthority effectively to help resolve the conflicts inBosnia and Herzegovina  in the Serbian-Montenegrinprovince of Kosovo and in the former YugoslavRepublic of Macedonia. Slovakiaís proactive approachin that regard was demonstrated by the political stanceit adopted towards the resolution of those conflicts  aswell as its participation in peacekeeping missions: theStabilization Force for Bosnia and Herzegovina and theKosovo Force for the Province of Kosovo.We believe that resolving the situation in theprovince of Kosovo is a prerequisite for thestabilization of the Western Balkans as a whole.Kosovo still represents a potential source of regionalinstability. That is why we attach great importance tonext yearís evaluation to be carried out as part of theKosovo Standards Implementation Plan. A favourableresult in that evaluation could launch a process underwhich the future status of the Serbian-Montenegrinprovince would be defined by the United Nations. Weperceive the United Nations activities  including theUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission inKosovo  as being of great importance in the search fora solution that is acceptable to all parties concerned  inaccordance with Security Council resolution 1244(1999).The Slovak Republic welcomed the transfer ofpower to a temporary  sovereign and independentGovernment in Iraq at the end of June. The InterimCouncil  which was recently established by theNational Conference  represents a significant stepforward in preparing for the elections to be held inJanuary 2005.I call upon the Assembly to join us in ourabsolute condemnation of all acts of violencecommitted in Iraq aimed at spreading chaos andinstability  whether by means of assassinations  thetaking of hostages or the intimidation of civilians andpublic figures.We welcome the determination of the Secretary-General to continue providing humanitarian aid andsupport for the political process in Iraq. We believethat the United Nations must play a leading role insupporting the Iraqi people and the Government intheir efforts to rebuild their society.Improving the security situation in Iraq is anessential condition for building long-term stability democracy  peace and prosperity in the country. ASlovak unit specialized in locating and destroyinglandmines  weapons and ammunition is currentlyengaged in a humanitarian mission there. In addition Slovakia has stepped up its participation by joining aprogramme for training Iraqi police officers.The Slovak Republic supports and appreciates theefforts of the international community to establishsecurity and stability in Afghanistan. The InternationalSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF) is playing a vitalrole  demonstrating how essential internationalcooperation can be. The most pressing issues wecurrently face with regard to creating stability inAfghanistan are  first  the forthcoming elections and secondly  laying down the foundations of democracy.In addition to those political processes  establishingfavourable conditions for economic development isalso essential for Afghanistanís long-term stability. TheSlovak Republic is contributing to such efforts throughits participation in ISAF and its planned involvementin provincial reconstruction teams.The Middle East peace process must continue inaccordance with the road map set out by the Quartetand endorsed by the Security Council  which envisagesthe establishment of two separate Israeli andPalestinian States in 2005. Both sides should fulfiltheir obligations stemming from that plan and previousUnited Nations resolutions. They should also rely uponthe international Quartet for help and good counselwhen taking those steps.As we are convinced that international peace security and development are closely linked  officialdevelopment assistance and cooperation withdeveloping and transition countries are becoming anintegral part of Slovakiaís foreign policy. SlovakiaísEuropean Union membership and its growingeconomic potential provide both an opportunity and theobligation to cooperate in the field of development.This year  the Slovak Government has allocated $25million for development assistance. In 2005  that figureis set to rise to almost $30 million. As a new donorcountry  Slovakia must work to further improve andformalize its mechanisms for providing official19development assistance. It is doing so with the supportof the European Commission and the United NationsDevelopment Programme.Severe humanitarian crises also pose a threat topeace and security in the modern world. Such crises arenot necessarily the result of armed conflicts alone  butthey sometimes have the potential to cause suchconflicts. The international community has the meansto intervene in humanitarian crises. With respect to thecurrent humanitarian and security crisis in theSudanese region of Darfur  I am convinced that theinternational community  in cooperation with theSudanese Government  will find a solution to thesituation through economic and financial assistance.The Slovak Republic has provided humanitarian aid tothat region and supports the continuation of peacefulnegotiations towards resolving the humanitarian andsecurity crisis there.The Slovak Republic is fully aware of theenormity of the tasks facing the United Nations in thefield of ensuring global peace and security. In thatregard  I would like to highlight that Slovakia is acandidate for a seat as a non-permanent member of theSecurity Council for the term 2006-2007 in theelections to be held at the next session of the GeneralAssembly  in the fall of 2005. I can assure theAssembly that in every respect  the Slovak Republic isready to take on the responsibilities arising frommembership in that key organ of the United Nations.As my countryís Head of State  I feel it is important tomake this personal pledge before the highly esteemedsession of the General Assembly. We want to use ourmembership of the Security Council to intensifycooperation with Member States in all regions and tobe a dependable partner when seeking consensus in theresolution of complicated global policy issues.In conclusion  allow me to wish this yearíssession of the General Assembly the greatest ofsuccess. May it reach conclusions that promotecooperation among Member States  international andregional organizations  and non-governmentalorganizations and associations ó based  above all upon the principle of multilateralism."
"160",6505,"SVN",59,2004,"Through the foundingof the United Nations almost 60 years ago  humankindraised its mutual cooperation to an entirely new level.31Prior to that  humankind painfully came to realize through a catastrophe of unimaginable dimensions  theinseparable link between its fate and the urgent needfor international cooperation.Today the fate of humankind is even morecrucially linked than ever before. The boundariesbetween the problems of “others” and “our” problemsare being increasingly erased. This applies to a widerange of areas: from security and social welfare to theeconomy and the environment. For this reason  worldproblems demand solidarity and the additionalcommitment of the international community to helpthose in need and to ensure that everyone will share inthe fruits of technological progress. In this spirit Slovenia supports the report of the World Commissionon the Social Dimension of Globalization and itsemphasis on the urgent need to ensure the conditionsfor a just and fair globalization.The Millennium Goals represent a majorcommitment to resolving problems of the modernworld. But the developmental goals for bridging thegap between rich and poor are not being realized to asatisfactory extent. Existing international mechanismsand institutions are not ensuring that the trends ofincreasing global imbalance can be turned around forthe better. We need change that will break through theinertia of established systems of operation. And for thiswe need new approaches: introducing innovativesources of financing world development can be onesuch approach. It is time for us to realize the urgentneed for change in world relations  and to summon thenecessary will to put these changes into effect andthereby raise international cooperation to a new level.The past year was again marked by internationalterrorism  which claimed countless innocent lives. Wewitnessed with pain the tragedies in Beslan  Moscow Madrid  Istanbul  Riyadh  Haifa and elsewhere.International terrorism is erasing the boundary betweenpeace and war. The common fight against internationalterrorism and its origins must remain one of thepriority tasks of individual Members and of the entireUnited Nations. This also applies to preventing thespread of weapons of mass destruction. The unanimousSecurity Council resolution is a welcome step towardseffective cooperation in this area.When we combat the universal evil of terrorism we should not do this at the expense of the existinglegal standards of human rights and internationalhumanitarian law. Any lowering of these standards willbe repaid to us in a reduction of the legitimacy ofinternational action — and consequently in a creationof fertile ground for further attacks on human security.We should also draw attention to theresponsibility of countries  in accordance with theprinciples of good governance  to ensure for theircitizens the necessary conditions for a secure anddecent life.In that context  we must express our concern atthe humanitarian situation in Darfur  and we welcomethe efforts of the United Nations and the internationalcommunity to seek a way out of the crisis.The increasingly direct contacts among culturesand civilizations bring new challenges and newopportunities. Let us exploit them for mutualenrichment and the formulation of a commonconsciousness of humankind. We will be able to do thatonly with the presumption of radical equality and thetolerant acceptance of plurality in human values. Theboundaries of the plurality of those values aredelineated by fundamental human rights and freedoms.The United Nations plays a central part in assertingthem internationally.Slovenia welcomes the start of work by the newHigh Commissioner for Human Rights  Louise Arbour and assures her of our full willingness to cooperate. Atthe same time  we express our continued support of theInternational Criminal Court  which represents animportant instrument for the exercise of the rule of lawand human rights.Only a multilateral response to modernchallenges can be effective. Of all existingorganizations  the United Nations is without doubt themost important and most appropriate for seeking suchresponses. However  it is in need of institutionalreform  so that its structure — the structure of 60 yearsago — can now better reflect the realities of today’sworld. Solutions to the burning issues facinghumankind must be sought within the United Nationssystem  otherwise solutions will be imposed outside it.Frequently  that will undoubtedly be to the detriment ofhuman development.Slovenia supports the efforts to revitalize theGeneral Assembly and acknowledges the achievementsof Julian Hunte  President of the General Assembly atits fifty-eighth session  in that area. We eagerly await32the report of the High-Level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change at the end of the year  and weexpress our willingness to cooperate fully. We hopethat  on the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations we will see such changes  which will ensure for thisglobal Organization a central place and the greatestpossible effectiveness in performing its mission.Increasingly  threats to international peace andsecurity are taking on new forms  which for a long timenow have not been limited to the danger of aggressionby one country against another. They cover a wholerange of internal tensions and conflicts withincountries  on the one hand  and transboundary threatssuch as international terrorism  environmentalpollution and the asymmetrical effects of globalization on the other. In modern threats to international peaceand security  States are not the only players. For thatreason alone  States cannot on their own provide asatisfactory response to them.Intergovernmental cooperation needs to besupplemented through the inclusion of various non-governmental organizations and global civil society.I would like also to highlight the responsibilityand potential of transnational corporations tocontribute to protecting the environment and toeliminating the tensions caused by global competitivemodels. Non-governmental organizations cancontribute to solutions through innovative approachesand by going beyond the limitations of establishedbureaucratic frameworks. They can help to create acritical mass of awareness regarding the urgent needfor change and the elimination of global imbalances.By incorporating the contribution of various segmentsof global society into the work of the United Nations we will make it more sensitive to the actual problemsof people in various parts of the world.In that context  we welcome the report of thePanel of Eminent Persons on United Nations-CivilSociety Relations  since it sets out a range of usefulproposals regarding the contribution of non-governmental actors.The complexity of modern threats to world peaceand security also require a strengthening of thecooperation between various regional organizationsand the United Nations. In this respect  we welcomethe open debate in the Security Council on this subject.Such cooperation is especially welcome in cases whereregional intervention can be more rapid and effectivein conflict prevention and in post-conflict peace-building.Next year Slovenia will assume the presidency ofthe Organization for Security and Cooperation inEurope  and in that capacity as well we will strive for afurther intensification of the good cooperation betweenthe two organizations.In that spirit  the European Union is assumingincreasing responsibility for stabilization and progressin the countries of south-eastern Europe. In the pastyear we have witnessed major progress on the part ofthe countries in the region. However  in some areas wealso saw a resurgence of the dangers created by still-unresolved inter-ethnic issues and a lack of socio-economic prospects.The goal of attaining democratic standards including in the areas of human rights and theprotection of minorities  must remain at the centre ofour efforts. At the same time  however  we have to notethat certain unresolved status questions hamper thepolitical and economic consolidation of the region. Wewill thus have to devote greater attention to resolvingthose questions.Globalization is erasing geographical boundariesand reducing the physical distances between people. Atthe same time  however  it is increasing the differencesbetween rich and poor — between those who aresharing in the positive effects of globalization andthose who are being pushed even further to themargins. Frequently we forget that not even those whoderive the greatest benefit from globalization canprotect themselves from its negative effects. Not eventhe richest and most technically advanced of us canisolate ourselves from international terrorism or fromthe effects of climate change and extreme poverty.For that reason  our common commitment andresponsibility must be to ensure that all people benefitfrom the positive effects of globalization  and that through our joint efforts  we ensure the protection ofthe environment. We can achieve this only through thebroadest possible partnership and solidarity. There aremore than enough signals that it is now high time forcoordinated international action."
"161",6550,"SWE",59,2004,"A few weeks ago  200innocent children were killed by terrorists in Beslan.Today alone  1 700 children will be born marked bydeath from HIV/AIDS from their first breath. Alsotoday  hundreds of children will die from starvation bullets or mines in numerous parts of the world.Has this world become a better place than it wasa generation ago? Yes  I still believe it has. Democracyis more widespread than ever before. The cold war hascome to an end. Fewer people are suffering fromfamine.Better - but still  this world is not a good place.As long as children die of famine  as long as war andviolence end lives that have barely started  the world isnot good. As long as children die from curable diseasessuch as malaria and tuberculosis  we - the politicalleaders of our countries - have not done enough.We need a stronger commitment  a stronger linkbetween words and deeds. We must pull together  moredetermined than ever. Each individual carries aresponsibility to take action for the sake of thecollective. We need a stronger United Nations.I want to see progress. Sweden is a staunchsupporter of United Nations reform efforts. Whileadvocating reforms  we believe that the core principlesof the United Nations Charter remain as valid as ever.Threats to international peace and security must be metcollectively. The use of force is permitted only as a lastresort and when authorized by the Security Council unless it is an act of self-defence.We need to make the United Nations morerelevant. We need a United Nations that can act earlyand quickly  in an integrated  sustainable andlegitimate manner. Last year  the Secretary-Generalcalled upon us all to take decisive action in order tosafeguard multilateralism. He will need our strongsupport to follow up on the report of the High-LevelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change.For the Security Council to remain legitimate representative and relevant  its composition must betterreflect the world of today. Since the adoption of theUnited Nations Charter  a small number of countrieshave emerged as key political and economic Powers.Those countries should be given a role which iscommensurate with their importance. We also need aSecurity Council that ensures the legitimate interests ofsmall and medium-sized countries. An expansion of theSecurity Council should not undermine its efficiency.A way to safeguard this would be to limit the use of theveto power. I hope that the High-Level Panel willpresent a bold proposal that will end the presentstalemate. A joint seat for the European Union shouldnot be ruled out as an option for the future.Managing transition from conflict to peace hasbecome a primary responsibility of the United Nations.A standing committee of the Security Council to adviseit on post-conflict transition issues would facilitate thattask. The Economic and Social Council must be moreeffective in bridging the gap between peacekeeping peace-building and development.Still  weapons of mass destruction constitute oneof the main threats to international peace and security.The threat of terrorism in connection with theproliferation of such weapons is real.The need for strong policies in disarmament andnon-proliferation is acute. The nuclear-weapon Statesmust show real progress towards disarmament. Effortsto combat proliferation must be strengthened.Compliance with existing treaties leaves much to bedesired  and must improve.A wave of terrorist acts has shaken the world inthe past few years. The months when we have not hadto mourn victims of terrorism are easily counted. Weare all repelled by the barbaric acts of terrorism aroundthe world  from Beslan to Jakarta. Nothing can becrueller than the violent  senseless and tragic loss ofinnocent lives. All States must work together topreserve a democratic  secure and open society. That ishow we will defeat terrorism.But we must also admit that we will never besuccessful if we fail to defeat the causes of terrorism.For me  it is clear: fanaticism and fundamentalism42exploit people's sense of injustice and lack of hope.Poverty  oppression  insecurity  intolerance  absence ofdemocratic structures and lack of political freedom óthey are all part of the breeding ground.The fight against terrorism must be carried outwith determination. There are no short cuts: humanrights must be respected; international law must befollowed. Our global human rights instruments aim atprotecting the individual. But just as human beings areequal  so are States  big and small. International law isthe ultimate guarantee that all States  no matter theirsize or power  are treated equally. For the sake of allnations  we need a strong multilateral system.The conflict between Israelis and Palestinianscontinues to take innocent lives  causing unendinghuman tragedy. Commitment from the parties to apeaceful solution and an end to occupation is crucial.On the Israeli side  excessive violence  extrajudicialkillings  settlement activity and destruction of propertymust end. Israel's right and obligation to protect itspeople must be exercised within the context ofinternational law. On the Palestinian side  areas ofparticular concern remain corruption  and security andpolitical reform. The indiscriminate and horrendousterrorist attacks must stop  and the PalestinianAuthority must do more to achieve that.To realize the vision of two States - a viable anddemocratic Palestine living in peace and security sideby side with an Israel within secure and recognizedborders  on the basis of Security Council resolutions242 (1967) and 338 (1973) - the parties need to meettheir obligations. The road map of the Quartet is thetool to achieve this  but both sides must demonstrate awill to use it.In Iraq  a united international community shouldgive the Iraqi people all necessary support for thebuilding of an independent and democratic Iraq. Tothat end  the role of the United Nations is vital. WhatIraq and the whole region need is not a new war  but anew peace.In Afghanistan  the security situation remainsworrying. The attacks against national andinternational assistance workers are unacceptable. Theinternational community should stand by Afghanistanin building a stable  secure and democratic society.The size and scope of United Nationspeacekeeping operations have expanded dramatically. Iwelcome the trend towards peacekeeping operationswith broad and comprehensive tasks  including theprotection of vulnerable civilian populations.Children continue to be victims of war andconflict. Nothing can be more important than the lifeand health of children. The late Swedish PrimeMinister Olof Palme used to say that it is notmeaningful to talk about 'my children and yourchildren'; it is all about our children - the onlytangible connection to the future that we have. Theirprotection should be paramount to all of us.Four years ago  Security Council resolution1325 (2000) on women  peace and security wasadopted. It was a groundbreaking achievement. Butnow we need to do more to translate its commonobjectives into concrete improvements for womenaround the world.An increasing number of United Nations andother peacekeeping missions are set up in Africa.While hardship is the plight of countless men  womenand children on the continent  Africa today brings hopeof a more vigorous leadership to confront itschallenges. President Thabo Mbeki showed the waywith his bold New Partnership for AfricaísDevelopment (NEPAD) initiative. From that followedthe creation of the African Union  which is nowestablishing itself as a decisive body for addressingviolent conflicts.International law should guide us in all ourcollective efforts to attain freedom from weapons ofmass destruction and terrorism  sustainabledevelopment and respect for human rights. Our finestachievement in international law in recent years is thecreation of the International Criminal Court. I call onthe Security Council to consider the possibility ofreferring matters to the Court. Sovereignty entailsresponsibility. The prevention of atrocities requiresinternational action if Governments fail to assume theirresponsibility.At the Stockholm International Forum on theprevention of genocide last January  we pledged toshoulder our responsibility to protect potential victimsof genocide  mass murder and ethnic cleansing. Wepledged to ensure that the perpetrators of genocidalacts are brought to justice. And we pledged tocooperate in the United Nations on these efforts.Discussions on the definition of genocide should neverstop us from taking action when it is called for.43The recent Security Council resolution  resolution1564 (2004)  on the terrible tragedy in Darfur is anecessary step in this direction. I particularly welcomethe request to establish an international commission ofinquiry. My Government stands ready to give theSecretary-General our full support in that task.I also welcome the appointment by the Secretary-General of Professor Juan Mendez as his SpecialAdviser on the Prevention of Genocide. That will serveto make clear the link between massive and systematicviolations of human rights and threats to internationalpeace and security.Another issue of serious concern is the use of thedeath penalty. For me  as a democrat and humanist  itcan never be accepted. I want us to make every effortto seek the abolishment of the death penalty.The Millennium Declaration and the MillenniumDevelopment Goals are at the core of the worldísefforts to put an end to hunger and poverty. Thecollective political will to give priority to sustainableglobal development  over short-term national interests will be the decisive factor in turning promise intoreality.Rich countries must fulfil their commitments. Iam proud to tell you that Sweden will reach its nationalgoal of 1 per cent of gross national income for officialdevelopment assistance in 2006. But developmentassistance alone will not yield the needed results. Boththe developed and the developing world must moveforward on a number of other issues. And Sweden willdo its part.We have translated the international agenda intonational policy  giving the entire range of governmentactivities one single objective: to contribute toequitable and sustainable global development. We willact in a coherent way with that single objective inevery field  whether trade  environment or agriculturalpolicy. But this is not enough. Other decisive areas aregood governance and transparency  democracy andhuman rights  women and workersí rights. Let us endthe blame game. Let us focus on getting the job done.Next year  we will gather in this Hall for asummit meeting to review progress on theimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. Bythen  we will also have reflected on the findings of theHigh-Level Panel and the recommendations of theSecretary-General.It will be a decisive moment for the UnitedNations. It will be a chance for us  the Members of theUnited Nations  to show that we believe in collectiveaction and that we will shoulder our responsibility formaking our international institutions stronger and moreeffective.Let us not fail the United Nations at this mostcritical juncture. Let us not shirk our responsibilities inthe face of complex new realities. Let us choose asecure and prosperous future for all."
"162",6588,"SWZ",59,2004,"Allow me to conveyto all members of the United Nations family the warmgreetings and best wishes of His MajestyKing Mswati III  Her Majesty the Indlovukazi  theGovernment and  indeed  the entire Swazi nation.The Kingdom of Swaziland congratulates you Sir  on your election to the presidency of this session.We are especially proud that a fellow African has beenelected to that demanding position  and we areconfident that your diplomatic skill and experience willhelp you to lead the Assembly towards a successfulconclusion of its deliberations.In the aftermath of 11 September 2001  the worldis understandably preoccupied with the question ofsecurity and the war on terror. The Kingdom ofSwaziland continues to condemn  in no uncertainterms  terrorism which constantly threatens worldpeace  security and stability. As part of our support forthe alliance against terrorism  the Government ofSwaziland is currently studying the United Nationsconventions that deal with terrorism  to ensure not onlythe adaptation of such important conventions  but alsocompliance with them. The Parliament of the Kingdomof Swaziland will be debating  and will hopefully pass its long-awaited anti-terrorism bill during its nextsession.Future world stability is also threatened by thecontinuing spread of weapons of mass destruction. Ourfailure as an Organization in that regard thus far is dueto inability to agree on a time frame suitable to allMembers for arms control and nuclear disarmament.The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of NuclearWeapons (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) were designed as an essential firststep towards a world free from the danger that suchweapons pose. We clearly need to find a way tostrengthen the non-proliferation regime and to preventthe flow of conventional weapons and anti-personnellandmines into zones of conflicts or into the hands ofterrorists. The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore callsupon the Conference on Disarmament to implement theproposal of the Non-Aligned Movement byestablishing  as its highest priority  an ad hoccommittee to begin negotiations on a programme forthe complete and time-bound elimination of nuclearweapons from those countries that have them.While the possibility of global conflict hasdiminished since the end of the cold war era  it is a factthat there has been a corresponding increase in theincidence of internal conflicts and cross-borderdisturbances  arising from a variety of causes including ethnic and religious confrontation.The situation in the Middle East is inevitably atthe centre of the debate on peace and security. TheKingdom of Swaziland pledges the continuation of oursupport for all initiatives and efforts aimed at resolvingthat situation and at bringing peace and stability to theMiddle East. We sincerely believe that the vital role ofthe United Nations continues to be critical to theresolution of the Middle East conflict.The creation of the African Union and the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  andthe great strides that have been taken in the past twoyears  are a clear indication that we are moving in theright direction. We are convinced that  with the supportof the international community and in the spirit of thetrue partnership that is demonstrated by mutual respect we shall succeed in our objectives  initiatives andefforts to raise the living standards of our peoples.We have placed our trust in NEPAD to be thevehicle for that shift away from the underdevelopmentand conflict of the past by addressing the fundamentalroot causes of our problems. The ongoing integrationof our initiatives and programmes within the Africancontinent will make possible sustainability and truegrowth in our economies. Together  in unity ofpurpose  we shall succeed. In that regard  we welcomethe establishment by the Secretary-General of theAdvisory Panel on International Support for NEPAD which will  in our view  help us to be more effective inour efforts to promote Africa’s development.Our united effort is also addressing the conflictsthat continue to threaten peace  stability and securityon the African continent. We realize that  without thoseelements  our development goals will continue to eludeus  especially because  apart from resources that arewasted on arms  our people can be productive and beable to trade among themselves and with the rest of the22world only under conditions of peace  stability andsecurity.The establishment of the Peace and SecurityCouncil of the African Union is a landmark event inour efforts to manage our conflicts. In particular  allowme to single out for commendation Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan for his tireless efforts to highlight andaddress African problems. We look forward to thecomplete resolution of the dispute in Somalia  and inparticular to the resolution of the dispute in the Darfurregion of the Sudan.The complex challenges facing the world todaylend greater significance and urgency to initiatives forthe reform of our Organization. The Kingdom ofSwaziland believes that those reforms are essential ifthe United Nations is to retain the global credibilityand authority that are so necessary to its operations.Our aim must be to transform the Organization into astructure that is truly representative of all Members andthat is transparent and efficient in its operations  whileremaining consistent with the purposes and objectivesof our founding Charter. We believe that achievingbalanced representation in the principal organs of theUnited Nations should be a priority.In that regard  we support an increase in bothpermanent and non-permanent seats in the SecurityCouncil. The Security Council in particular requiresreform in order to strengthen its legitimacy. Itscomposition must reflect the plurality and diversity ofthe membership of the United Nations  to recognize theprofound geopolitical changes that have taken place inrecent history. However  due to a lack of political willon the part of some Members to increase themembership of the Security Council  progress in thereform agenda remains unattainable.Turning now to the question of development  webelieve that the Millennium Declaration marked aturning point in carrying out the mission unanimouslyentrusted to the United Nations in the area ofsustainable development. Indeed  for the first time heads of State or Government agreed on specific goalsand targets in the social  economic and educationalfields  up to the year 2015. In our view  the leaderswere correct to make the related topics of peace security  development and poverty eradicationpriorities to be addressed  because future worldstability depends on the ability of nationalGovernments to increase the momentum for economicdevelopment and their capacity to improve the deliveryof job creation and essential services such as healthand education.Developing countries have been facing specialdifficulties in responding to the challenges broughtabout by globalization. As a result  many developingcountries  especially the least developed ones  haveremained marginalized in the globalizing worldeconomy. Consequently  the benefits of globalizationare unevenly distributed. In that regard  the Kingdomof Swaziland believes that in order to maximize thebenefits of globalization  the process of integration intothe world economy should take into account the levelof economic development of each country and thecapacity of its institutions and enterprises. Inparticular  specific national development potentials andsocio-economic circumstances  as well as differinginitial conditions relating to size  resourceendowments  economic structure and location  shouldbe considered. It is also necessary to take into accountthe specific development  financial and trade needs ofdeveloping countries  in view of the fact that there canbe no one-size-fits-all trade development strategy.I believe that I speak on behalf of many from thedeveloping world when I say that small economies arenot receiving fair treatment in global trade. Theproposed removal of preferential terms for ouragricultural products and the continuation of subsidiesfor such products from the developed world is bound todeal a fatal blow to many of our weak economies. Werequest understanding and appreciation of our situationby our developed partners. We are asking for apartnership that will take into account our uniquesituations as developing economies so that we canparticipate effectively in the global market. For ourpart  as small economies  we pledge quality and highstandards for our products. Our farmers are more thanready to deliver the best to international markets. Itshould be noted that agricultural incomes are thecornerstone of development for our rural communities.For our part in the Kingdom of Swaziland poverty alleviation remains the number-one priority.Sixty-six per cent of our people are living below theinternationally recognized poverty line  yet ourclassification as a lower-middle-income countryprevents our access to many of the funds and resourcesthat are available to those in different categories. Wewill be working with the United Nations to ensure thatthis situation is corrected.23In the meantime  we are focusing our efforts andavailable resources on programmes that meet thechallenges of poverty in a sustainable and equitablemanner. Our national development strategy  which isthe result of direct consultation with all stakeholders has incorporated all eight priority United NationsMillennium Development Goals so as to provide uswith a blueprint for government action towardsachieving the vision of improving the livelihood of ourpeople by 2022.Despite all our best efforts and our limitedsuccess in many areas  we are restricted in our capacityto meet our objectives due to a multitude of problemsthat are affecting us simultaneously and that we cannotovercome on our own. As is the case with alldeveloping countries  we are particularly at risk intimes of global economic difficulties and areparticularly vulnerable to disease and to the effects ofchanging weather patterns.Weakening our efforts to meet our developmentchallenges is the threat posed by multiple healthhazards  including malaria and tuberculosis  butespecially HIV/AIDS. AIDS continues to claim thelives of many of our people. No sector of developmenthas been spared the ravaging impact of the HIV/AIDSpandemic  with enormous strain placed on our financialand human resources as we make the requiredinterventions. We are attacking the enemy on variousfronts  with priority on prevention  care  counsellingand treatment. Our National Emergency ResponseCommittee has had some success with regard to home-based and community-based care for those already illas a result of infection.Unfortunately  we are currently experiencing anexodus of qualified nurses  who are being employed inthe developed world. The exodus has adverselyaffected our capacity-building efforts. That exodus together with other wider impacts of HIV/AIDS  hasdealt our economy a heavy blow.The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to make thewelfare of children a priority in our development strategy.In that regard  both the Government and the privatesector  including non-governmental organizations(NGOs)  have responded with zeal and determinationto the plight of orphans and other vulnerable children resulting from the effects of the pandemic. TheGovernment is providing bursaries for such children inorder to ensure that their education is not disrupted.The Government and the business community  inpartnership with NGOs  are providing school feedingschemes in order to improve their nutritional balance.We are also using our traditional structures to cater fortheir material and emotional needs; this includes theprovision of local reporting structures to prevent theabuse of those children. The chiefdoms also providefields where communities grow food for orphans andother vulnerable children.Let me take this opportunity to express the mostprofound gratitude of the entire Swazi nation to theUnited Nations and to all our development partners forthe support we continue to receive as we face thatkiller disease. The support we have received from theGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malariacontinues to prop up and sustain our programmes andstrategies in our fight against this scourge. Fellowmembers  we shall be forever grateful to you all.The Kingdom of Swaziland is fully committed tothe principles of good governance and the rule of law.The nation has just completed debating the Kingdom’sdraft constitution  and the draft will soon be submittedto Parliament for final consideration before the end ofthis year.For more than 30 years  the Kingdom ofSwaziland has been enjoying excellent relations with anation which  despite an outstanding record ininternational development assistance and despitefulfilling every requirement for membership in theOrganization  is nonetheless excluded fromparticipation in the activities of the United Nations. Iam referring here to the issue of the 23 million peopleof the Republic of China on Taiwan  who are deniedthe right to contribute to the global initiativesundertaken by this world body. The Government andthe people of the Republic of China on Taiwan havemade enormous advances in economic  social andpolitical terms  and they have shown themselves readyand able to share their experience and advice with allthe nations of the world. The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore  proposes to the Assembly that the time hascome to revisit this issue so as to ensure the inclusionof the Republic of China on Taiwan in the activities ofthe United Nations and its associated agencies.In conclusion  I would like to take thisopportunity to express the deep gratitude of HisMajesty the King  the Indlovukazi  the Governmentand the people of Swaziland to the United Nations and24its agencies for the many programmes of assistanceundertaken in the Kingdom of Swaziland since ourindependence.We believe that the United Nations  as the onlytruly global Organization  remains the only hope forovercoming the many complex challenges facing theworld today. Despite the setbacks  and despite theobstacles to achieving our collective aims  there can beno doubt that the world could be a more troubled placewithout the combined efforts of all of us. The Kingdomof Swaziland  therefore  takes great pride inreaffirming our commitment to the principles andideals set out in the Charter  and we ask Almighty Godto watch over and guide us in the challenging timesahead for our Organization."
"163",6618,"SYC",59,2004,"My delegation  Sir  is delighted at seeing you presidingover this session of the General Assembly. We alsowish to state the high esteem in which we hold the pastPresident  Mr. Julian Hunte  of Saint Lucia  and forSecretary-General Kofi Annan.The Seychelles  a small island country  is definedby the fact that it belongs to two regions — the IndianOcean and the African continent — and by the fact thatit belongs to several linguistic and cultural areas.Today we wish to be an example of cohabitation ofman and nature and an example of unity and cohesionwith our people. These two objectives are at the heartof our development plans.In April of this year  Mr. James Michel succeededMr. Albert Rene in the presidency of the Republicthrough a calm and proper political transition. The newPresident defends the same development philosophy taking into account  of course  changes on the worldscene  and the economic needs that are inherent instarting a new phase of our development. Thus  thePresident has assessed our difficulties and the optionsavailable to us in different areas of our economy  suchas the balance of payments  the debt burden  accessunder reasonable terms to capital — and in this contextwe are a middle-income country — access to markets and so forth.Together with the Bretton Woods institutions andour other customary partners  we have committedourselves to a progressive programme of adjustmentand of giving new dynamics to our economy. Ofcourse  we are progressing at our own pace  becausewe remain a vulnerable economy  since we are a smallisland country  isolated from markets.I would like to say a few words about theSeychelles’ commitment to the internationalcommunity. First of all  on the question of security  thefight against terrorism  money laundering and drugtrafficking are  in the Seychelles  subjects ofprevention and deterrence. We are taking action totackle the causes  the methods and the effects of thesecriminal actions. The Seychelles has ratified allinternational conventions on drug trafficking  and wesupport all United Nations resolutions on theprevention and suppression of the financing of terroristacts.We support the recommendations of the FinancialAction Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) andthe requirements of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) and theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF).2We have enacted a law this year on the preventionof terrorism  and at the present time we are revisingexisting legislation on financial institutions and onmoney laundering. I might add that our offshore sectoris also being monitored in the framework of theimplementation of a law on the provision of serviceswhich was promulgated last year.We are fully committed to the fight for securityand stability. However  it is being done in difficultconditions  because the very questionable criterion ofgross domestic product per capita blocks our access tomost development assistance programmes.A small and vulnerable State always attachesmore importance to recognition of its own identity andthe defence of its stability. We  therefore  unreservedlysupport the principles and objectives of global peace security and development that are embodied by theUnited Nations. We want the Organization to remainextremely active in its initiatives to restore peace particularly in the Middle East and in Africa  to allareas where conflicts today have become chronic andare steadily worsening.We hope that the reorganization of the UnitedNations  which is now under way  will make it possiblefor it to be repositioned  on the basis of concreteactions and follow-up and monitoring mechanisms. Webelieve that the Security Council must be open to morepermanent and non-permanent members  so that thedeveloped and developing countries of Africa  Asiaand Latin America can contribute to the Council’sdynamics.More than ever  a genuine North-South dialogueis essential to resolve conflicts and to seek sharedsolutions to shared problems posed by AIDS  poverty debt and terrorism — all threats that require a jointresponse and shared responsibilities. This dialoguerequires new ethics and a new approach todevelopment  which revitalizes international relationsand corrects injustices. It is particularly important todeal with the roots of the debt problem and to adoptenergetic measures in order to assist those States whosedevelopment is stymied by this burden.We welcome the exchanges between the Group ofEight and the developing countries. This is anegotiating platform that should have brought aboutconcrete action and implementation of therecommendations of the Millennium Summit  andthose of Monterrey  Johannesburg and Doha. It isparticularly important that the allocation by thedeveloped countries of 0.7 per cent of their grossnational product to international development shouldbe seen and accepted as a realistic and fair objective.We expect the meeting to be held in Mauritius atthe beginning of 2005  ten years after the adoption ofthe Barbados Programme of Action  to produce anuncompromising assessment of the Programme’simplementation and to adopt operational measures andmechanisms. We are counting on the activecommitment of our partners for that assessment and itsfollow-up.Support and commitment should be expressed inthe area of international trade through equitabletreatment towards developing countries that havestructural weaknesses  such as small island developingStates. Such arrangements must take into account thedelicate issues of access to markets and trade relations.The goal is to prevent our countries from becomingfurther marginalized in a system that claims to be inthe interest of all. That is why we invite the WorldTrade Organization to adopt an approach todevelopment that is consistent with the developmentsof recent years. I am referring to the launch of theDoha round  devoted explicitly to development  and tothe assertion of an African voice on sensitive issuessuch as commodities and raw materials. The new traderelations must also enable developing countries tocontinue to acquire the means to be more competitive.Another urgent matter for us  the countries mostvulnerable to the consequences of global warming  isthe ratification by all developed countries of the KyotoProtocol. It is the only instrument capable of actingeffectively with respect to a danger of concern to all.We believe that a special fund should beestablished in the United Nations to help fragileeconomies confront losses  including loss of income caused by climate change.I reaffirm the importance we attach to the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)because it is one of the best tools for enabling Africancountries to manage their own development. Weappreciate the commitment of the Group of Eight inthis regard through its African Action Plan  and it isour heartfelt hope that NEPAD’s development agendawill comprehensively address the specific needs of theeight African island States.3All these questions are of capital importancetoday. We hope that the British presidency of theGroup of Eight in 2005 and the United Nations summitto review the Millennium Development Goals  alsoscheduled for 2005  will work a very clear rebalancingin favour of our countries.Seychelles reaffirms its support for the GeneralAssembly  and we thank you  Mr. President  for yourpersonal action. We also thank Secretary-General KofiAnnan. My country is an advocate of the cause ofdevelopment  which is a fundamental right. That rightentails the obligation of political solidarity in the mostactive sense of the term."
"164",6663,"SYR",59,2004,"I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection as President of the fifty-ninth session of theGeneral Assembly. I am confident that your wisdom drawn from the positions of your friendly country ofGabon  will stand you in good stead in promotingdialogue among the peoples and the countries of theworld  in invigorating the role of the United Nationsand in preserving its Charter.I also express my appreciation  Sir  to yourpredecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  for his efforts to bringthe previous session to a successful conclusion.I take this opportunity to express our gratitude tothe Secretary-General for his patience and efforts tomake the voice of the United Nations heard in aprecarious international situation  amid volatileregional conditions  in which force is preferred to law wrong preferred to right and war preferred to peace.Our world has been going through extremely difficulttimes since 11 September 2001. That is particularlytrue of the United States and the Middle East. The5United Nations could have very well shared the fate ofthe League of Nations in the 1930s  although very littlethought was given to the dire consequences that such adevelopment would have entailed  given the absence ofother alternatives.It is no exaggeration to argue that the majorchallenges today to the questions of peace  security anddevelopment stem not only from failing to heed theUnited Nations Charter but also from manipulatingsome of its Articles to greatly disrupt and derailinternational relations and to deliberately upset theinternational equilibrium that we inherited from thecold war era.Thus  it becomes clear that the surge inextremism  the diversity of its causes andmanifestations and the spread of poverty and hungeracross large parts of the world are not the concern ofonly one country  one people or one religion  but rather  of all peoples  countries and religions of theworld.It is also clear that this deteriorating situation which the international community acknowledges buthas failed to strive in earnest to remedy  will not serveanyone in particular. This is all the more true now thatthe justifications of the cold war era  with its enormousexpenses on armaments  can no longer be invoked andthat pre-emptive wars  with the great losses in life andproperty they entail  have proven useless. The mistakescommitted during the world war on terror  regardless ofwhether they were committed in good faith or in badfaith  have worked as a call to promote and practiceterrorism  which has been embraced by an enemywhose whereabouts we do not know. This enemy iscommitting acts so horrific that they remind us of theMiddle Ages.In this context  the peoples of the developingcountries are wondering why hundreds of fighter jetsand thousands of soldiers would be hauled across thecontinents and why billions of dollars would be spentto bring about a regime change in certain countrieswhen those resources could have been channelled —even partially — into financing education anddevelopment projects in those same countries? Whenreform becomes a national and an internationaldemand  how can we justify to those seeking reformthe fact that the movers and the shakers of the worldchose to impose sanctions instead of investing in peaceand prosperity and chose to spend billions on warinstead of opting for the road that would surely lead toreform and progress? Is it possible to prove thatthroughout history military solutions  and not politicalor economic solutions  have been more effective toolsfor reform and progress and for saving the lives ofmillions of people plagued by injustice  poverty anddisease? At any rate  while political solutions may notnecessarily guarantee full success  military solutionsare definitely a recipe for failure.Moreover  while such an argument may soundidealistic  there can be no alternative to politicalsolutions. The current international dilemma isexacerbated by military solutions. There are manyexamples to prove that argument. We can cite  by wayof example  the situations in Iraq  Afghanistan andother places.Left alone  that dilemma will not be solved. It canonly be solved if the leaders of the world work inearnest and evince the necessary political will torestore credibility to the United Nations and guaranteerespect for international legitimacy through theircommitment to United Nations resolutions that arebased on the principles and purposes of the Charter.Justice and equality  it must be recalled  are at the coreof the Charter of this Organization.The peoples of the world were optimistic aboutthe great strides that were made in science andtechnology and the collective and individualachievements that spanned all fields of humanendeavour in the past two decades. They aspired to aglobalization with a human face that was based on adialogue among civilizations  and synergies with othercultures  that would keep the spectre of cold and hotwars at bay. However  some power circles attempted toexploit those great human achievements to further theirown narrow interests. They devised new colonialistpolicies that disappointed the peoples of the world andturned back the clock.At the speed of light  the world forgot about thesurge of optimism that overwhelmed many of theworld’s leaders as they addressed this Assembly fouryears ago when they celebrated the third Millennium.Today  a wave of pessimism has taken over the worldbecause of extremist and intolerant policies advancedby some strategic think-tanks that were determined tofind a new enemy  under any pretext  after the fall ofthe Soviet Union.6Israel has contributed to the creation of many ofthose flimsy pretexts. It has packaged them with greatcare  breathed life into many of them  and distributedthem among the delegations that owe allegiance to it. Itwas hoping to achieve the following: first  to incite theAmericans in particular and the West in general towage endless wars in the Middle East  in order tounderscore the old-new theory of Israel that the Arab-Israeli conflict is not the core of the problems of theregion. To prove our point we refer to the argumentpromoted by Israel that the situation in Iraq and itsrepercussions are more dangerous and complicatedthan that prevailing in the occupied Arab territories andPalestine. Sharon is trying to mislead world publicopinion into believing that achieving peace wouldrequire only the dismantling of some Jewish settleroutposts in Gaza  not withdrawal from the West Bankand the occupied Palestinian territories  let alonewithdrawal from East Jerusalem and accepting a justsolution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees.Secondly  Israel hoped to divert the attention ofthe world and camouflage the settlement activities inthe occupied Arab territories that have continuedunabated  while continuing to build the racistsegregation wall and lessening the importance of Stateterror perpetrated by Israel on a daily basis. Israel hasrepackaged its policies as an act of self-defence thatdoes not warrant condemnation and denunciation eventhough it targets innocent civilians.But Israel has not fully succeeded in realizing itsgoals  and even where it has  that success will be short-lived because Israel has in recent years transformed itsregular army into gangs bent on committing systematickillings and war crimes against Palestinian civilians all perpetrated in the territories it occupies in the WestBank and Gaza. Killing the Palestinians often occurs inthe course of house demolitions that terrorize theirwretched occupants  who frequently look death in theeye.All this notwithstanding  the defencelessPalestinians have stayed the course and refused tosurrender or leave. Israel bears an important share ofthe responsibility for the intensification and worseningof the American predicament in Iraq by avoiding theresumption of the peace process despite the handextended to it in peace by the Palestinians  Syrians  andLebanese.I must repeat that Israel bears an important shareof the responsibility for the intensification andworsening of the American predicament in Iraq owingto its failure to resume the peace process. The Israelicourse of action may come back to haunt it because itscontinued occupation of the Arab lands is a majorcause of the rejection of American policies in thebroader Middle East.That is also true in Europe where polls conducteda year ago showed that most of the citizens of theEuropean Union believe that Israel poses a threat tointernational peace.Among the strategic mistakes committed by thethink-tanks and research centres that owe theirallegiance to Israel is to mislead the Israelis intobelieving that the new Iraq will hasten to concludepeace agreements with Israel and establish diplomaticrelations with it before it withdraws from the occupiedArab territories. They ignored the fact that the Iraqisrefused to adopt the new flag that was designed fortheir country after the war simply because its colourssomehow bear resemblance to the Israeli flag.The deteriorating situation in Iraq remains asource of great concern for my country and othercountries in the region and the world. That state ofaffairs should prompt all of us to mobilize all efforts towin the battle for peace in post-war Iraq.Syria  a neighbouring country directly concernedwith events in Iraq — given our historic andgeographical ties as well as our common nationalbonds with the Iraqi people — has spared no effort toguarantee Iraq’s stability  security  independence territorial integrity and the unity of its people. Westand ready to cooperate with the neighbouringcountries and all the parties concerned  including theUnited Nations  to enable the Iraqi people to governthemselves  manage their resources and establishoptimal relations with their neighbours.Syria has repeatedly declared its commitment to ajust and comprehensive peace. We continue to call forthe withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territoriesoccupied in 1967  for guaranteeing the legitimate rightsof the Palestinian people  including their right toestablish their own independent State with Jerusalemas its capital  in accordance with the resolutions ofinternational legitimacy  namely  Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  the Madrid7terms of reference and the Arab Peace Initiativeendorsed by the Beirut summit of 2002.That was the basis of Syria’s serious engagementin the peace negotiations for over a decade. Theliterature published on the subject recently in theUnited States and Israel bears witness to theseriousness with which Syria approached thosenegotiations. What the peace process lacks today is astrategic Israeli decision comparable to the Syriandecision to achieve peace in the region.It was rather disparaging that the ForeignMinister of Israel used this rostrum of internationallegitimacy to ignore the facts and selectively refer to aresolution recently adopted by the Security Council onLebanon. Israel violates Lebanese airspace  territorialwaters  land borders and sovereignty on a daily basisand continues to occupy parts of Lebanese territory.The representative of Israel tried  in vain  tomisguide the international community. The worldcommunity today bears witness to Israel’s persistentnon-compliance with 40 Security Council and 600General Assembly resolutions  all of which call uponIsrael to withdraw from the occupied Arab territoriesso that a just and comprehensive peace can beestablished in the region. Soon after the adoption ofevery resolution Israel would reject it  levellingaccusations and heaping insults on the Organization. Ithas refused to allow entry to members of fact-findingmissions  and has even harassed them. Given all thosefacts  does anyone have the right to ask whether thestatements by the representative of Israel mark thebeginning of a radical change in the position of hisGovernment  perhaps indicating the pursuit of a policythat respects international legitimacy and is committedto compliance with its resolutions?For centuries our region has endured moreforeign threats and onslaughts  acts of aggression misrepresentations of facts and use of force against ourpeoples than any other region. Its potential has beenwasted and its material and intellectual resourcessquandered  thus preventing it from attaining itsdevelopment goals and advancing its capacities. TheMiddle East suffers an explosive situation broughtabout by Israeli’s expansionist policies  continuedoccupation and virtual sabotage of any chance forpeace in the region. Furthermore  Israel’s acquisition ofa nuclear arsenal constitutes a major destabilizingfactor in the Middle East region that threatens thefuture of its peoples.Syria was among the first countries of the regionto call for declaring the Middle East region a zone freeof all weapons of mass destruction  in particularnuclear weapons. We have seriously worked to attainthat objective. We have joined the Non-ProliferationTreaty (NPT) and concluded a comprehensivesafeguards agreement with the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA). We have also contributed tonumerous initiatives to attain that goal  most recentlythrough the draft resolution we submitted on behalf ofthe Arab Group to the Security Council on29 December 2003 (see A/58/667  annex). The draftresolution called for the establishment of a zone free ofall weapons of mass destruction in the Middle Eastregion  in particular nuclear weapons  in the context ofa collective international monitoring regime underUnited Nations supervision  which would enhance therole of multilateral international disarmamentconventions.International terrorism is a cause for concern forus all. Together we should work to eradicate thatdangerous phenomenon by addressing its root causes.It is on this basis that Syria has condemned terrorism inall its forms and manifestations. We condemn thekidnapping and killing of innocent people and thetargeting of civilians  government institutions humanitarian agencies  religious establishments international organizations and diplomatic missions.In that context  we reiterate our condemnation ofthe heinous terrorist act that killed innocent children ina school in Beslan  Russia. We also call on theinternational community to condemn the systematicState terror perpetrated by Israel in the occupiedPalestinian territories against the defencelessPalestinian people  as well as the many massacresperpetrated by Israeli occupation forces  in whichinnocent children  women and the elderly are killed.During its tenure on the Security Council  Syriastrove to support the Council’s efforts to combatinternational terrorism. It has acceded to most of theinternational counter-terrorism conventions as well asto the Arab and Organization of the Islamic Conferenceanti-terrorism conventions. The two latter conventionsdefine crimes of terrorism and distinguish betweenterrorism and the legitimate right of occupied peoples8to resist occupation in accordance with internationallaw and the United Nations Charter.My country is following with great concern thedevelopments in the brotherly Sudan. That concernstems primarily from our commitment to the territorialintegrity of the Sudan and the unity of its people. Weview with satisfaction the positions and measuresadopted by the Government of the Sudan to address thehumanitarian crisis in Darfur. We believe that theLeague of Arab States and the African Union can playan important role in the settlement of the crisis.Syria welcomes the increased role of the AfricanUnion in seeking effective solutions to the major issuesfacing the countries and the peoples of Africa. Webelieve that the African Union’s conflict settlementmechanisms  including its Peace and Security Council will strengthen the role of that important continent andits ability to face the challenges of peace anddevelopment.In the Millennium Declaration  world leadersunderscored the need to create an environmentfavourable to development and to eradicate poverty atthe national and global levels. Have we acted uponthose commitments? How far have we gone on the roadtowards implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals? Have we taken the necessarysteps and cooperated far enough to give the necessaryimpetus to efforts towards progress in the entiredeveloping world?Development is a human right to which everyhuman being is entitled. It is not an exclusive privilegeavailable to one side to the detriment of the other regardless of the disparities between them. That rightshould be accorded priority status on our agenda  and itmust not be manipulated for political gains.It is heartening to note that some enlightenedleaders have taken it upon themselves to shed light ontwo of the most critical problems of our world: povertyand hunger. In launching the Action Against Hungerand Poverty  they proposed practical collectivesolutions to preserve man’s dignity. Syria welcomes theDeclaration issued by the world leaders in response tothe initiative of the Brazilian President to discuss thatquestion.Syria has effectively contributed to the debate onthe reform of the United Nations system  therevitalization of the General Assembly and the reformof the Security Council and the increase of itsmembership. Syria hopes that  at this session  theAssembly will continue to address the urgent questionsof peace and development so that a broad consensuswill emerge and coordinated measures will be adoptedtowards resolving those questions. The prime objectiveof reforming the United Nations is to enhance itsability to face the new threats and challenges.However  reform should be built on commitment to theprinciples and purposes of the Charter.Syria is following with keen interest the work ofthe High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges andChange appointed by the Secretary-General to reviewcurrent and future threats to international peace andsecurity and the current state of affairs of the mainorgans of the United Nations  with a view to submittingproposals on enhancing their roles. Syria will beparticipating in the deliberations among Member Stateson the proposals and opinions of the Panel.As we have made clear in past years  Syriasupports reforming the Security Council and increasingits membership. In our view  that reform should bebased on the principles of universality  effectiveness democratic participation and geographicalrepresentation  particularly of developing countries.Syria has consistently stressed the importance ofassigning a permanent seat on the Security Council tothe Arab States  to be allocated by rotation among theMember States in accordance with the procedures ofthe League of Arab States.Since its establishment  the United Nations hassuccessfully overcome many acute regional andinternational crises. Its Charter has had to coexist withsome of those crises. At times  the United Nations hasdealt with those crises successfully. At other times  ithas skirted them without actually coming to grips withthem. A case in point is the Palestinian question  whichis as old as the United Nations itself. The Arab-Israeliconflict still rages in spite of the fact that the UnitedNations has adopted more than 600 resolutions on thesubject. Israel  however  has not implemented a singleone of these resolutions and continues to findprotection both inside and outside the United Nations.A lot has been said about establishing a greaterMiddle East. We are convinced that success inachieving that will remain elusive unless the relevantresolutions are implemented and peace is restored  in9accordance with the aspirations of the people of theregion and the world."
"165",6708,"TCD",59,2004,"Firstof all  on behalf of the members of my delegation andon my own behalf  I would like to congratulate you Sir  upon your election to the presidency of ourAssembly. Your election is a great tribute to both oursubregion in Central Africa and to your country  theGabonese Republic. It is also a sign of recognition ofyour abilities as a statesman and a guarantee of ourwork’s success. My thanks and my congratulations alsogo to your predecessor and his team for theirdedication and the enthusiasm with which they did agreat deal of work — which was much appreciated byall — in a particularly tense environment marked byanimated debates about the Iraqi crisis.Finally  I would like to pay a particular well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of ourOrganization  our brother Kofi Annan  whosecommitment and unceasing efforts to establish lastingpeace and sustainable development in the world arepraiseworthy. He can count on Chad’s support for all ofthe initiatives that he is still undertaking with courageand tenacity  particularly in dealing with the problemsand conflicts in Africa  initiatives through which he isthus contributing to restoring our Organization’scredibility.A year ago  when we addressed this Assemblyand reiterated our commitment to defend the greatcauses of mankind  we took that opportunity tocondemn terrorism and all forms of blind violence andintolerance that could lead our world astray. Werecalled at the time that our States needed to apply theUnited Nations Charter in reacting to terrorist acts —or acts considered as terrorist — that constitute a threatto international peace and security. We reiterate thoseappeals  and call again on the sense of responsibility ofour States to act together to curb by all possible meansthe major scourges that are such a dangerous threat toall mankind  physically as well as socio-economically.5With respect to combating terrorism  theGovernment of Chad  for its part  is activelycooperating with the appropriate institutions of theUnited Nations  under Security Council resolution1373 (2001)  in order to strengthen its nationalcapacity to prevent and combat this scourge.The past year for Chad  as for many Africancountries  was a year of serious concerns regarding thearmed conflicts raging everywhere — conflicts thattook peaceful populations hostage  destabilized ourStates and continued to jeopardize the joint effortsbeing made to establish democratic institutions andpromote socio-economic progress.Let us say  however  that the accomplishmentsunder the agenda that led to the re-election of thePresident of Chad  His Excellency Idriss Deby  for asecond term are progressing at a reasonable rate inspite of various difficulties. This agenda  which isperfectly in line with the Millennium DevelopmentGoals  seeks to create  through good governance conditions that are conducive to the strengthening ofpeace and stability in the country so that we canpromote education and health for all social strata employment — particularly for the youth andwomen — and true synergy among the different forcesand competencies arising from the various nationalentities. This must be done so that we can do aneffective job in combating poverty and the greatpandemics  such as HIV/AIDS and malaria. I recallhere that this agenda  in which the fight againstilliteracy and ignorance is written in capital letters  isbased on the most important principles: peace  securityand justice. Without these  it will not be possible tobuild a society in which universal values such asdemocracy and the respect for human rights areensured.In addition  the task of adapting our legislation tonational and international realities was imposed on ournational representation meeting  which made acommitment on 26 May 2004  to a procedure aimed atamending some provisions of the Fundamental Lawadopted by referendum on 31 March 1996. Thisprocedure  which will harmonize the Constitution withthe requirements of democracy and fundamentalfreedoms  is in keeping with the final provisions of theConstitution  which itself authorizes the revision.In this context of globalizing economies  inwhich the rules of the game are constantly beingsubverted  in particular by the practice of the largestStates of subsidizing their own agricultural products tothe detriment of the poorer countries  all efforts toresolve these developmental problems have beeninconclusive. Even a strict application by our States ofstructural adjustment measures is still seriouslythreatened by the double weight of foreign debt and thecomplexity of social problems. Those issues make itpractically impossible to take action to stimulateeconomic growth in the developing countries.With the exception of oil resources  we arewitnessing an ongoing decline in export earnings dueto fluctuating commodity prices on internationalmarkets  and losses  caused principally by the policy ofproviding subsidies  continue to grow; yet States havebeen slow to help the least developed countries bymeeting the commitments they made at successivedevelopment conferences.Here  let me speak of the cotton initiative  whosepurpose is to obtain compensation for harm caused bysubsidies that have been detrimental to the economiesof cotton-producing African countries. It isincreasingly urgent to ensure respect for the laws ofcompetition  which the States seen as the principalinitiators and defenders of free markets now seem to bedisregarding.As if that were not enough  in addition to theinherent difficulties of the international economicenvironment  those very farmers are today confrontinga threat of an entirely different scope: the invasions oflocusts. This raises the spectre of famine throughoutthe Sahelo-Saharan countries. Chad is in a naturalreproductive zone for locusts and is also considered acorridor for locust swarm migration.The situation is of even greater concern because in addition to the other difficulties  the areas exposedto locust invasion are the ones that are protecting theSudanese refugees. Our countries have taken theappropriate measures  thanks to the assistance of ourpartners; we have thus been able to deal with theprogress of the first locust swarms. However  the threathas not disappeared.At the risk of having to manage a humanitariancrisis that could result from the destruction of foodcrops by the locusts  we must mobilize financialresources and the necessary technical and logisticalmeans while we still have the time  in order to curb thescourge. We thank the countries and international6organizations that have helped my country  and I takethis opportunity to reiterate my Government’s appeal tothe international community for vigorous actionagainst the threat of locusts. Responses to the appealwill help us set up appropriate structures for preventiveaction.While speaking of natural disasters  I mustmention the consequences of tropical depressions thatare doing a great deal of damage and that have  in thepast few weeks  claimed thousands of victims amongthe populations of the Caribbean islands. We expressour sympathy to those populations  and I would ask thewealthy nations to provide the needed assistance tohelp them recover from the disaster.In addition to natural disasters  armed conflictstoo play a part in exacerbating the social crises fromwhich our people are suffering. In 2004  my countryand the United Nations have engaged in intensivediplomatic activity related  inter alia  to thehumanitarian and security situation along the borderbetween Chad and the Sudan. That situation  which isthe result of a conflict between the rebels of Darfur and the central Government in Khartoum  is of seriousconcern to my Government. The scope of the hostilitiesand the violent excesses perpetrated against civilianpopulations by the various parties to the conflict  haveprovoked massive and continuous flows of Sudaneserefugees to the eastern and north-eastern regions ofChad. That flow has consequences for our people andfor the environment  whose ecosystems were already ina precarious state of fragility caused by the aridity ofthe soil and the climate.The President of the Republic of Chad quicklyunderstood the consequences of the conflict and madea commitment to help our brothers in the Sudan find apeaceful solution  by offering to mediate between theparties. He personally initiated the inter-Sudanesenegotiations on the Darfur conflict  with the signatureof the Abeche Agreement on 3 September 2003. Thatprocess was followed by the 8 April 2004 N’Djamenaagreement on a humanitarian ceasefire  and the25 April agreement on a joint commission; these willprovide a framework for negotiations on a final andcomprehensive settlement of the conflict.In other words  we could not remain indifferent tothe tragedy that the people in Darfur wereexperiencing. It is our duty  more than any othercountry  to help our brothers in the Sudan to reconcile.We have spared no effort to help President OmerHassan A. Al-Bashir and his Government  whilerespecting the sovereignty of their country  to resolvethe Darfur conflict.Thus  we took the risk of exposing ourselves tocriticism from the rebel movements  which accused usof favouritism  as well as the discontent of the Chadianpeople related to the people of Darfur. This clearlycontradicts the widespread disinformation claimingthat the Government of Chad might have supportedsome kind of rebellion against the legitimateauthorities of the Sudan  with which our country hasclose ties of friendship and cooperation in all areas. Wewill never stop fulfilling our mission to mediatealongside the African Union to urge our Sudanesebrothers to renounce war once and for all and topromote sincere dialogue in order to resolve theconflict.In spite of the recent uncertainties due to thehardening of positions  we place our hope in the Abujatalks under the auspices of His Excellency PresidentOlusegun Obasanjo of the Federal Republic of Nigeria current Chairman of the African Union. We believethat the adoption of Security Council resolution 1564(2004)  whose full implementation by the Governmentof the Sudan is expected in order to facilitateconditions conducive to the return of populations totheir homes  will be followed by complementarymeasures aimed at convincing the other parties to theDarfur crisis to take a constructive approach at thenegotiating table. We hope that the internationalcommunity will be firm with all sides in order topromote a successful conclusion of the process of apolitical settlement of the Darfur crisis.Throughout the terrible times the populationsalong the border of Chad and the Sudan have endured international solidarity has been evident. I mustexpress the appreciation of the Government of theRepublic of Chad for the many forms of assistance wehave received from the international community  whichhas allowed us to help the refugees.I would also like to call upon States andorganizations represented here to convey to theappropriate authorities in their countries andorganizations an appeal to continue or renewhumanitarian assistance to the refugees  whether fromsouthern Sudan or southern Central Africa  whom weare sheltering in the south of our country.7I would also like to ask the internationalcommunity to help the populations of the host regionsnot only to provide shelter for the refugees but also tomake possible the reconstruction of theirsocioeconomic structures that have been affected bythe unexpected flow of refugees. The flow of refugeesand their prolonged stay in Chad would — if we arenot careful — have consequences which might bedangerous to the security of my country.Having agreed to abide by the internationalcommitments it has freely entered into  Chad isreceiving the refugees and looking out for their safety.In the long term  the international support that mycountry enjoys should focus on promoting thevoluntary return  within a short and reasonable time  ofrefugees to their countries of origin. Internationalassistance to refugees must therefore be designed andconducted so as not to perpetuate the presence of therefugees in Chad.While we are working together with theinternational community to ease the pain of therefugees on our soil  we say frankly that we can in noway tolerate Chad being used as a base for subversiveactions  for acts of terrorism or for the conduct ofhostile or destabilizing actions against the institutionsof the refugees’ countries of origin. Thus  theGovernment of Chad will act  with all the unambiguityreflected in its current position  against refugees whobecome involved in such activities.The gravity of the humanitarian and securitysituation born of the crisis that is raging in Darfur hasnot deflected my country’s attention from other similarconcerns on the continent. We are following attentivelyand with great interest the evolution of other conflictsthat are taking place in Africa and in other parts of theworld. We are pleased to see the efforts being madewithin the African Union and the United Nations tofind lasting solutions; we are available to help as bestwe can. Therefore  the Government of Chad hasdecided to respond to the needs outlined by theDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations by makingavailable to the United Nations a contingent of 150qualified men.On this solemn occasion  how could we fail torecall the unjust and undemocratic situation thatcharacterizes the structures of our Organization? Iwould like to say firmly that my country remainscommitted to the common African position regardingthe restructuring of the United Nations  including theenlargement and reform of the Security Council inorder to ensure equitable representation of all regions.All the initiatives taken by Secretary-General KofiAnnan regarding United Nations reform are muchappreciated by my country  which awaits with interestthe outcome of the deliberations under way. Theobjective is the revitalization of the United Nations.All suggestions should help us to improve theperformance of the principal organs and thefunctioning of present and future funds andprogrammes.To that end  my country would expect account tobe taken of the concerns and viewpoints of MemberStates and groups of States that have been reiterated onmany occasions in the Assembly. Chad awaits withequal interest the outcome of the study onglobalization: the current characteristics and directionof globalization by no means enable weaker ortransitional economies to benefit fully from theopportunities it offers.Another injustice should be pointed out. I mustdraw the Assembly’s attention to the question of theexclusion from our ranks of a large community of the23 million men and women of the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan. Those men and women  who increasinglyare asserting themselves in international trade and aregenerating wealth throughout the world  deserve to befully associated in decision-making on subjects and inareas with an impact on their lives and those of allhumankind. The United Nations would have everythingto gain and nothing to lose with their activeparticipation in debates on the many topics ofinternational concern. Their contribution wouldundoubtedly enrich the Assembly debates and wouldhelp us build the operational capacity of our worldinstitutions  funds and programmes.The distressing legacy of armed conflictsincludes buried caches of abandoned munitions andunexploded ordnance and  in particular  anti-personnelmines. Referring to the danger of landmines  theSecretary-General has said that these abominableweapons  buried by the millions  are not only waitingsilently to kill or maim innocent children and women but their presence — or even the threat of the presenceof one single landmine — can put a stop to cropcultivation  deprive an entire village of its livelihoodand thus place one more obstacle along the difficultpath to reconstruction and development. Chad is8actively participating in the preparations for the OttawaConvention review conference soon to be held inNairobi and will continue to act to eliminate all ofthese arms so as to attain the objective of an Earthwithout mines.I would like to take this opportunity to thank without exception  all the States and all theintergovernmental and non-governmental institutionsthat have helped us establish and implement ourhumanitarian demining programmes. We ask them fortheir continued generosity  and we ask them to extendtheir assistance to survivors among the victims oflandmines  to help design and implement programmesenabling these individuals to be reintegrated sociallyand professionally. I appeal to all United NationsMember States to join in this humanitarian undertakingby acceding to the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel landmines."
"166",6754,"TGO",59,2004,"Inexpressing to you  Sir  our great pride at seeing aneminent representative of the Group of African Statespreside over the General Assembly at its fifty-ninthsession  I wish to offer you  on behalf ofMr. Gnassingbé Eyadema  President of the TogoleseRepublic  and of the Government and the people ofTogo  which it is my great honour to represent  oursincere wishes for your success in fulfilling yourmandate.We also congratulate Secretary-General KofiAnnan on his dynamic and unequivocal work at thehead of our Organization.The present session of the General Assembly isbeing held at a time when international peace andsecurity continue to be seriously threatened  requiringour common Organization fully to shoulder its role andmission with even greater determination and bolderinitiatives. Indeed  we are living in a world ofprecarious balances arising from our collectiveinability to establish genuine peace and shared well-being in the framework of international legitimacy.In Africa  the legitimate aspirations of people tolasting peace  in particular in those countries andregions where that peace is being sorely tested  haveyet to be achieved.In Côte d’Ivoire  after numerous short-livedhopes have been dashed  the implementation of theAccra III Agreement remains today the sole hope forthe restoration of peace and stability in that country.The Togolese Head of State  who from the verybeginning of the crisis committed himself to the path ofdialogue and reconciliation  will continue to beinvolved in the peaceful settlement of that fratricidalconflict.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo recently arisen obstacles to the peace process  which isintended to lead to the holding in 2005 of elections forthe creation of new institutions  have required theinternational community to spare no effort inmaintaining the gains won through the costlydeployment of the United Nations Mission in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and inlaunching  whenever necessary  such operations asArtemis to nip in the bud any impulse towards aresumption of combat wherever it may arise. TheGovernment of Togo therefore unreservedly supportsthe Secretary-General’s proposal significantly toincrease the number of MONUC personnel.It is to be hoped that the international conferenceon peace  security and development in the Great Lakesregion  to be held in November  will be the appropriateframework for finding lasting solutions to the problemsof insecurity and instability that continue to weakenrelationships among States of the region and tojeopardize the emergence of a climate of good-neighbourliness and mutual understanding.In the Sudan  regarding the tragedy unfolding inDarfur  the international community must urgentlyassist the Government of that country and the SudanPeople’s Liberation Army/Movement to consolidate thepeace process through the signing of thecomprehensive peace agreement. In that regard  theinternational community must provide consistentsupport to the African Union’s peace operation.In Burundi  Liberia and Somalia in particular  theoutburst of solidarity and renewed interest which theinternational community continues to show in therestoration of peace and the recovery of thosecountries  battered by long years of war  should beaccompanied by more adequate financial and logisticalassistance. Togo  for its part  will continue tocontribute to conflict and crisis resolution in Africaand to support the various United Nationspeacekeeping operations by supplying militarycontingents or observers  as it is currently doing inCôte d’Ivoire  Burundi  Liberia and Haiti.The prevailing situations in the world particularly in Iraq and the Middle East  are a source ofmajor concern. In Iraq  the restoration of fullsovereignty to the Iraqi people and the recognition thatthe United Nations has an important role to play inrebuilding the country should give every element ofIraqi society the opportunity to work with resolve to11build a stable and prosperous country free of allviolence.In the Middle East  the ongoing escalation ofviolence between the State of Israel and the PalestinianState may definitively compromise the continuation ofthe peace process and the implementation of thevarious agreements that have been signed. In thatrespect  the international community and the Quartetmust strive to persuade the two protagonists to avoidunilateral action and to return to the negotiating tableon the basis of the road map and the relevantresolutions of the Security Council.Furthermore  we wish to emphasize  again withrespect to crisis issues  that post-conflict situationsclearly demonstrate the importance of providingadequate financing  not only for humanitarianassistance but also for other vital programmes topromote peace and sustainable development. There isthus a need for the financing of disarmament demobilization and reintegration programmes for ex-combatants and other long-term instruments forensuring peace — such as education  health care andjob creation for young people — to be made a priorityof post-conflict peace-building.In the same context  the troubling financialsituation of the three Regional Centres for peace anddisarmament call for more attention from the Assemblyif they are to enjoy the financial resources necessary tofulfil their mandates harmoniously. In that regard  andon the basis of the relevant Secretary-General’s reports the delegation of Togo firmly believes that it is hightime for the General Assembly seriously to review thefinancing of the Regional Centres in order to providethem with adequate financial resources under theOrganization’s regular budget. In so doing  the GeneralAssembly would demonstrate its genuine support forthe Organization’s goals in the area of arms control anddisarmament and its appreciation of the active roleplayed to date by the Centres. For its part  my country which hosts the United Nations Regional Centre forPeace and Disarmament in Africa  will do its utmost toensure the Centre’s continuity and long-term viability.Terrorism is the other major danger of our timesbecause it continues seriously to threaten our Statesand is thus a scourge in the face of which failure to acteffectively means giving way to the forces of evil.Having endured terrorism in the past  Togo once againcondemns the heinous terrorist attacks perpetratedrecently around the world and keenly hopes that moredecisive action will be undertaken to eradicate thatdisease of the human conscience.From that perspective  while it is up to each Stateto take the measures necessary to strengthen securitywithin its own borders  we must strive above all toenhance regional and international cooperation amongStates and to ensure that the poor States can enjoyadequate assistance in the implementation of effectivenational mechanisms to combat terrorism.Economic and social development is a corollaryof peace and security. We all recall that  at the dawn ofthe twenty-first century  the Millennium Summit wasconvened here in this very Hall. Following the Summit at which the problems of poverty and developmentwere debated  the heads of State and Governmentadopted the Millennium Declaration  an unprecedentedaffirmation of international solidarity in which the richand poor countries together undertook firmcommitments whereby they forcefully reaffirmed theirwill to reduce by half  by the year 2015  the proportionof the world’s population touched by poverty. Worldleaders voiced the hope at that time that other majormeetings also held early in the new millennium wouldserve as a framework for the birth of genuinepartnership between the countries of the North andthose of the South.Several years later  however  we note with regretthat the Millennium Development Goals have beenhard to achieve. Indeed  the necessary resources tofinance sustainable development and to combat povertyand hunger in the developing countries have not beenmobilized and  contrary to expectations  only a smallnumber of developing countries have been able tomake progress in the elimination of poverty.The critical economic situation in Africa requiresa collective awakening and introspection. What hashappened to our myriad commitments? What hashappened to our many promises?Regarding the rules of international trade  whichremain unfavourable to the poor countries; regardingthe long-awaited debt relief; regarding the fact that thegoal of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product forofficial development assistance has been met by only asmall fraction of donor countries  we may well askourselves what happened to the solidarity so loudlyproclaimed at the Millennium Summit.12Last year’s failure of the World TradeOrganization trade negotiations in Cancún — designedto settle the critical issues of eliminating agriculturalsubsidies and providing access to the markets of theindustrialized world for the products of the countries ofthe South — highlighted yet again the North-Southdivision and evoked real fears for the future of themultilateral trade system.On the basis of those questions and concerns  thedelegation of Togo reaffirms the need for allinternational partners to reflect in deeds the politicalwill they proclaimed at the International Conference onFinancing for Development and the World Summit onSustainable Development so as to give new impetus toefforts to increase official development assistance  toprovide debt relief and equitable access to markets  toprotect the environment  and to combat malaria HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and other infectious diseases.2005 will be a crucial year for our Organization.Indeed  in 2005  we shall engage in in-depthconsideration of the implementation of the MonterreyConsensus. In 2005  we shall hold a high-level debateon the implementation of the Declaration ofCommitment on HIV/AIDS. In that regard  we need tobear in mind that the twenty-sixth special session ofthe General Assembly set specific goals to be met for2003 and 2005 towards the eradication of HIV/AIDSpandemic.Above all  2005 will be the year of the high-levelplenary meeting to engage in a comprehensive reviewof progress made in the implementation of all of thecommitments undertaken in the MillenniumDeclaration and at the major United Nationsconferences and summit meetings in the economic andsocial fields.We therefore await those meetings with interest.They will give us the opportunity to reaffirm ourpolitical commitment to building a world of greatersolidarity and prosperity in order to give hope oncemore to that significant segment of the world’spopulation that lives on less than $1 a day  suffers fromhunger and malnutrition and has no access to drinkingwater.The peace and economic and social developmentthat we desire for our countries cannot be achievedwithout the effective participation of peoples inmanaging public affairs. Democracy in Togo  based ona multi-party system and the rule of law  has become avibrant reality  inter alia  through the adoption ofimportant legislative and administrative texts and theestablishment of virtually every institution provided forby the Constitution. With faith and determination  theGovernment of Togo  under the impetus of the Head ofState  is striving to build a genuinely democraticsociety that also takes the sociological realities of ourcountry into account.In order to complete its task  the Government hasdeclared its openness to any constructive contributionfrom the national political class and civilian society  aswell as from our development partners. In that context on 14 April it opened consultations with the EuropeanUnion  in conformity with article 96 of the CotonouAgreement of partnership linking that organization tothe African  Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. Atthe outset of the consultations  the Governmentendorsed a number of commitments whoseimplementation is currently near completion andshould ultimately lead to a better foundation ofdemocratic culture and the consolidation of the rule oflaw.The Government intends to strive to bring theconsultations to a successful conclusion  the ultimateobjective of which is the resumption of cooperationbetween the European Union and Togo. The politicalzeal of the Togolese authorities — reflected in theimplementation of an ongoing inclusive nationaldialogue; the adoption of a press and communicationscode; the drafting of an improved electoral code and afinancing law for political parties; and the decisiontaken by the Head of State on 11 August to releasemore than 500 common-law prisoners — is a guaranteeof the Government’s resolve to create favourableconditions for the citizens of Togo to enjoy theirfundamental rights  and in particular their political andeconomic rights.We take this opportunity to launch an urgentappeal to all our development partners to assist theGovernment of Togo in the process of strengtheningand consolidating democracy and the rule of law.I cannot conclude without returning to therecurrent issue of United Nations reform. TheGovernment of Togo wishes to propose that bolddecisions be taken at this session to accelerate theprocess of reform of the system  and of the SecurityCouncil in particular  so that the issue can be more thana mirage. Indeed  the numerous challenges confronting13today’s world require a strengthened and moreeffective Security Council  which only a morerepresentative and more democratic membership canensure. In that respect  Africa deserves an appropriateplace within that vital United Nations body.The Security Council must therefore be enlargedin both the permanent and non-permanent membershipsso as to meet the democratic requirements of our timesand to allow various groups of countries to providetheir valuable assistance in achieving the objectives ofour Organization  which include peace and security working for freedom and democracy  guaranteeingglobal prosperity through free and equitableinternational trade  preserving a healthy environmentand creating stable international relations based ondialogue. If we truly seek to achieve all this  we mustgive our common Organization the resourcescommensurate with doing so.May this session serve to strengthen cooperationamong our States and peoples and assist us inconsolidating peace and in achieving security andlasting development for all."
"167",6799,"THA",59,2004,"At the outset  allowme to begin by congratulating you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits fifty-ninth session.The United Nations has long stood for the loftiestaspirations and the noblest causes of mankind. In timesof strife  it is the United Nations that holds out thehope of harmony. In times of deprivation and suffering it is the United Nations that holds out the hope ofhealing.After almost 60 years  however  thisOrganization  on which we pin so much hope  findsitself in the midst of an existential crisis. In a worldever more complex and less predictable  the UnitedNations has been struggling to redefine its meaning identity and relevance for the era of globalization. Toconfront those new realities and more  no challengewill be greater than making the United Nations a moreeffective Organization for the times. No challenge willbe greater than living up to the highest ideals of theUnited Nations with more action and fewer words.Our United Nations locomotive is powered by thecommitment and good will of its Members. It can takeus as far as we want to go  but only if we all pulltogether. It can take us at any speed  but only if thepower of commitment and good will is fully energized.For whatever it is and for whatever it will be  theUnited Nations is the creation of its Members. So  indemanding more of the United Nations  we must alsodemand more of ourselves. And in asking the UnitedNations to do more  we must also be ready to becommitted more.The task ahead of us all is to make sure that allconcerted efforts are made nationally  regionally andglobally to advance the causes the United Nationsstands for and to restore total confidence in theworking of multilateralism. Multilateralism cannotthrive or sustain without foundation. The foundation ofthe United Nations and its multilateralism may be its191 Member States  but what bond binds the 191Member States to the United Nations multilateralsystem?The world’s strategic  political and economiclandscape of the twenty-first century is certainly fardifferent  more complex and more intertwined than thatof 1945. The layers of interwoven fibre that supportsuch a multilateral institution as the United Nationsmust be modified and strengthened. It is Thailand’sbelief that  given today’s international landscape  thereis a greater need than ever to create new layers ofregional and subregional building blocks to strengthenthe United Nations multilateral foundation. Thosebuilding blocks are the bond that binds nations to themultilateral system.In so doing  those regional and subregionalbuilding blocks must bear the responsibility ofsupporting and advancing the United Nations goals onsecurity and development: reducing poverty  combatinginternational terrorism  fighting transnational crime 16promoting human dignity and human rights  andupholding the human race as a whole.In South-East Asia  the Association of South-EastAsian Nations (ASEAN) is to create its three-pillaredcommunity — the ASEAN Economic Community  theASEAN Security Community and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community — by the year 2020. Therealization of ASEAN communities  as in otherregional or subregional communities  requires bridgingthe development gap.It was Thailand’s initiative to take on the role ofbuilding that bridge by introducing the EconomicCooperation Strategy — known as ACMECS — andthereby laying a faster track towards sustainabledevelopment for its neighbours: Cambodia  Laos Myanmar and Vietnam. Through the creation of morejobs and the narrowing of the income gap  that strategywill serve as a building block for ASEAN’s three-pillared community.Further to the east  the ASEAN 10 are workingwith its East Asian friends to create the East AsianCommunity  comprising the ASEAN 10  China  Japanand the Republic of Korea. To the west  Thailand seesthe need to connect south-east Asia’s development withits friends in South Asia. The first summit of theBangladesh  India  Myanmar  Sri Lanka and ThailandEconomic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) — seven countriesin South-East and South Asia around the Bay ofBengal — took place in Thailand in July  agreeing on afree trade area within the group which forms aneconomic and development bridge between the twosubregions.These building blocks and that partnership arepart and parcel of the firm foundation for the AsiaCooperation Dialogue (ACD)  the first pan-Asiandevelopment forum. The ACD was initiated on thebasis of Thailand’s conviction as to the virtue ofpartnership in drawing strength from diversity and intransforming diversity from a phenomenon that tears usapart to a force that unites us.With 25 member countries — countries fromevery part of Asia — and still growing  the two-and-a-half-year-old ACD will become an important buildingblock for multilateral cooperation and the UnitedNations multilateral system. Through such buildingblocks  we can learn to live with one another’sdifferences and to cultivate a culture of peace andtolerance in order to counteract the violence and terrorin today’s world.We cherish multilateralism as the best means tosecure peace around the world. We cherishmultilateralism as the best means to develop prosperityaround the world. But above all  we cherishmultilateralism as the best means to achieve bothsecurity and development worldwide. By the sametoken  State security and human security  which fosterdevelopment  must always be two sides of the samecoin.From Iraq to Saudi Arabia  from Indonesia toRussia  shocking acts of terror have been perpetrated seemingly calculated to shake confidence andundermine hope. As civilized societies  we must cometogether to fight terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations  wherever it may occur. Terrorism is adirect threat to State security  but it also undermineshuman security.That is why the development of human securityand State security must proceed on parallel tracks. Theworld cannot be a secure place if its population is stillsuffering from poverty and deprivation. The worldcannot really be peaceful if we cannot be successful inour efforts to make progress towards achieving theMillennium Development Goals.That is why Thailand believes in theenhancement of human security as a means of makingthe nation secure. Domestically  the Ministry of SocialDevelopment and Human Security is in charge of ourpolicy and implementation. Internationally  we areactive in the Human Security Network and in otherinternational arenas in which human security issues areparamount.Thailand has long advocated balanceddevelopment  with freedom from fear and freedomfrom want as the two inseparable prongs of humansecurity. We intend to continue to do so even moreintensively as Thailand prepares to assume thechairmanship of the Human Security Network in 2005-2006. We intend to further advocate such balanceddevelopment by embracing partnership between theGovernment and civil society.The Human Security Network statement issued inThailand on the eve of the 15th International AIDSConference in Bangkok last July — which wasattended by more than 25 000 people and recognized17HIV/AIDS as an issue of both development and humansecurity — clearly reflects development and security asinterconnected.We view the issue of landmines in the same light.They are as much a humanitarian issue as adevelopment one. As President of the Fifth Meeting ofthe States Parties to the Mine-Ban Convention  I havebeen working with the World Bank to reflect thatapproach in carrying out mine action. I am grateful forthe Bank’s cooperation in realizing the developmentdimension of the landmine issue. I also appreciate theBank’s readiness to mobilize resources for the trainingof deminers and capacity-building for survivors so thatthey may function as productive members of society.We are confident that the World Bank partnership willprovide States parties to the Convention with greaterresources that will help to achieve the Convention’sgoal.As we try to secure peace for the world; asattempts are made to shatter our world’s peace andsecurity with terror  fear  hatred and violence; as manystruggle against poverty; and as we pledge ourcommitment to the Millennium Development Goals the multilateral system that we need to rely upon isfacing challenges and threats to its effectiveness ofunprecedented a magnitude and proportion.However  amid those challenges  we are fortunateto see today nations building partnership with nations;nations learning to live with differences  and eventurning differences and diversity into a commonstrength; and nations learning to achieve a higher levelof tolerance  working at the economical  cultural andpolitical levels to nurture a culture of peace and aculture of tolerance.Through building blocks like the ones Thailandhas been initiating in Asia  throughout Africa  LatinAmerica  Europe and elsewhere  and through South-South cooperation  a number of responsible nations areready to make contributions  in their own way  to turndifferences into cooperation and partnerships. Thosepartnerships and building blocks deal with security anddevelopment  the two defining principles of the UnitedNations.Those partnerships and building blocks can laythe foundation for a more effective functioning of theUnited Nations multilateral system — a system thatneeds redefining and redesigning to respond effectivelyto the new geosocial and political landscape of theworld.Present-day realities — the emergence ofbuilding blocks  the inextricable linkage betweendevelopment and security  and the need to develophuman and State security on parallel tracks — clearlyreflect how much the world has changed since 1945.That is why United Nations reform is not aquestion only of the effectiveness of any particularorgan of the Organization. Nor is it merely a questionof numbers or composition. It is fundamental therefore  to ask some pertinent questions.How can the United Nations be made moreresponsive to current needs and realities  so that itdevotes equal attention to the issues of security anddevelopment? What would be the best mechanism todeal adequately with issues of development and long-term global economic issues? What would be the bestmechanism to deal adequately with post-conflictnation-building and reconstruction? What would be thebest mechanism to ensure a greater participation ofcivil society  recognizing it as an importantconstituency for development and conflict resolution?How to ensure cooperation among the multilateralUnited Nations system and regional  subregional andinterregional organizations  recognizing them asimportant building blocks for a more effectivemultilateralism?Security Council reform is needed. That much isnot in doubt. But if expansion is needed  what realisticcriteria are necessary for the expansion to reach greatereffectiveness? Does it need to be more transparent?What are the roles and relationship among itsmembers?Concerning the General Assembly  a bodyrepresented now by almost 200 Member States  morethan three times larger than at the time of the foundingof the United Nations  is it too cumbersome and do weremain content with its work process? How can theAssembly be streamlined  energized  and become morefocused?Those are not all the questions asked  andThailand is not the only one asking. But all of us willhave to find the answers. While we are all entitled todifferent views  opinions  and analyses  ultimately thedecision must be made by us  the Member States of theUnited Nations.18Reform of such a venerable institution is nevereasy. We have to be realistic about that. But we havefaith in the far-sightedness and wisdom of UnitedNations Members to take a holistic view and choosethe right path  even if it is the path less travelled.Thailand pledges to apply all our experiences inforging partnerships in order to play a responsible andconstructive role in contributing to the United Nationsreform process. We have supported the High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change and will lookforward to its report in December  as well as to thefruitful and constructive debate by all of us thereafter.Whether the United Nations recovers from itsmid-life crisis or sinks into irrelevance is up to us  theMember States. For what it is and what it will become the United Nations is our own creation made of ourown commitment and goodwill. It is up to us to rise tothe challenge. Only when nations are united  will weget the United Nations."
"168",6824,"TJK",59,2004,"Weall pinned great hopes on the advent of the twenty-firstcentury with regard to a more stable and secure worldand sustainable development for humanity. We were alleager to expand the positive achievements of thetwentieth century  which witnessed rapid technologicaland social progress  the beginning of the space age  theadvancement of democracy and the globalization of theplanet. We all wanted to leave behind the destructiveimpact on human history of two world wars  continuedblood conflicts  millions of refugees  poverty and thedestitution common in most countries of the world.It had seemed that  at this junction of centuriesand millennia  humanity would rediscover andappreciate more deeply the value of a world withoutwars or violence and the significance of solidarity andmutual understanding  of true human rights and respectof the views of others. Now  however  it has becomeclear that it is impossible to comprehend the dynamicsof global development or to find adequate answers tomodern challenges without the United Nations as aleader.The impression had been that  in the new century our civilization would embark on the path towards aglobal society where harmony would prevail overhatred and stability put an end to suspicion — a societywhere the agreed rules of conduct set out ininternational law  binding for all  would stand in theway of isolationism and separatism; where allinternationally relevant issues  including the mosturgent ones  would be resolved at the negotiating table;and where the use of force would not be the rule but rather  the exception  and only when sanctioned bycollective decisions of a capable and representativeSecurity Council.Unfortunately  the twenty-first century hasbrought more new and menacing challenges thansolutions to the numerous problems faced byhumankind. The number of wars and military conflictshas not diminished but increased. The peacefulresolution of the inter-Tajik conflict achieved underUnited Nations auspices is more the exception than therule in the context of the efforts to achieve peaceundertaken by the United Nations.The world’s peoples increasingly feel that theworld is in a state of permanent war rather thanworking towards development. Every day we hearabout the dangers of the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction and the struggle against internationalterrorism. These are urgent problems  and we cannotbut be concerned about them since weapons of massdestruction are capable of destroying hundreds ofthousands of human lives  while acts of terror candestabilize entire countries.For those reasons  we are firmly resolved totransform Central Asia into a region free of nuclearweapons. The recent tragic events in the town ofBeslan  in the Russian Federation  are clear evidence9that the forces of international terrorism are  day byday  becoming more daring and continue to challengethe whole of humankind.Tajikistan resolutely condemns the acts ofviolence perpetrated against defenceless women andchildren in North Ossetia and appeals to theinternational community to undertake urgent collectivemeasures to combat this scourge of the twenty-firstcentury.It is comforting that the international solidaritydemonstrated in the struggle against such abloodthirsty and treacherous enemy as terrorism isgaining in strength. Tajikistan has been activelywaging  at the regional and international levels  amultifaceted struggle against the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and terrorism.At the same time  in order to definitively put anend to terrorism  it is very important to reach auniversal understanding of its nature andmanifestations in order to eliminate any obstacles thatstand in the way of the development and adoption of acomprehensive convention on international terrorism.While we can rightly be proud of having created within a short period of time  a united anti-terroristcoalition of States  unfortunately we cannot say that wehave achieved the same degree of solidarity in the fightagainst poverty and destitution.For decades  States with low levels of incomehave not been able to free themselves from theirdestructive debt burden so as to be able to enjoy theadvantages of civilization. For instance  Tajikistan which lived through a civil conflict  continues to faceurgent economic and social problems  despite havingmade some economic progress. Eighty per cent of thepopulation of Tajikistan still lives below the povertyline. Because of the lack of access to the sea  manyregions of our country are cut off from the outsideworld  which results in our paying higher prices forimported goods and increased transit fees. Forty percent of all budget revenues go to servicing externaldebt  which limits the Government’s capacity to meetthe urgent needs of the population.Writing off a portion of the accumulated debtwould make it possible for those countries to invest ineducation  health care and environmental protection and  in the case of Tajikistan  could be helpful inrehabilitating the social sphere  which has suffered as aresult of the civil conflict and natural disasters.However  the idea of exchanging debt for sustainabledevelopment has not yet garnered solid support amongcreditors. In that area  we still encounter inertia and alack of political will.It is clear to us that the resolution of politicalissues  including those related to international security depends  to a great extent  on social and economicdevelopment and on the achievement by all countriesof the Millennium Goals.In a globalized world  achieving the MillenniumGoals will require the utmost solidarity as well asinteraction among the international community as awhole  with the United Nations as a leadingcoordinator  in its capacity as the most universal andrepresentative international Organization.The key to success lies in developing a commonand comprehensive approach to addressing poverty-related issues  enhancing the means available as well asseeking innovative ways of securing financing fordevelopment  eliminating ecological threats addressing demographic problems  ensuring anequitable international finance and trade system  anddealing with the aftermath of natural disasters. Failingthat  the situation will remain the same: a quarter of theworld’s population will continue to prosper  using morethan half of the world’s resources  while the majorityof the world’s population  finding themselvesmarginalized  will remain mere observers of globaleconomic development.The ever-increasing severity of these problemsmakes them global threats to international peace andsecurity. For that reason  we support the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  in his efforts to restore thebalance of priorities on the agenda of the internationalcommunity.The international community should also strive toensure maximum coordination of the actions taken atthe global level in terms of monetary  financial andinternational trade policies. In that connection  it isimportant to strengthen the role of the United Nationsas the key force for political mobilization in thoseareas. That requires  on the basis of the Monterreyconsensus  a further reinforcement of the interactionamong the United Nations  the Bretton Woodsinstitutions and the World Trade Organization  whichTajikistan hopes to join in the near future.10The issues of economic rehabilitation  povertyeradication  improved living standards for thepopulation and long-term sustainable development areamong the top priorities for Tajikistan  as an economyin transition.At the same time  for a number of reasons Tajikistan still needs the assistance of the internationalcommunity in supporting national efforts to ensurelong-term sustainable development in the country. Weappreciate the continued efforts of the donor countriesand United Nations agencies such as the UnitedNations Development Programme  the United NationsChildren’s Fund  the World Food Programme andothers to assist vulnerable segments of the population as well as their support in the ongoing transition to asocially oriented market economy.Given our own experience  we support thepriority attention given by the United Nations toincreasing the effectiveness of the assistance renderedto countries in post-conflict situations and to receivingfeedback in that area. There is no doubt that the UnitedNations is the key player in providing timely andcoordinated responses to post-conflict situations.The success of the United Nations in this areadepends to a great extent on a qualitative interactionwith host Governments in the area of reinforcingnational potential  the introduction of effectiveinstruments and mechanisms for the coordination andmobilization of resources  and increased interactionwith the Bretton-Woods institutions in the context of ajoint assessment of their needs and specific projectactivities.In this regard  it is noteworthy that one of thelessons learned from the peaceful settlement of theinter-Tajik conflict is the need for donor countries to beactive not only during the crisis but also in the post-conflict period. I am convinced that strengthening thefoundation of peace and stability in countries livingthrough conflict requires not only humanitarianassistance but also actual help in addressing economicproblems and support for countries’ efforts to create adynamic and stable economy. As a rule  these kinds ofinvestments  within the framework of a peacefulprocess  turn out to be instrumental in strengtheningyoung democracies born out of conflict. There is nodoubt that the parliamentary elections to be held inTajikistan in early 2005 will prove once again thevitality and irreversible nature of the peace process inTajikistan and the robustness of the country’sdemocratic institutions.Achieving ecologically sustainable developmenton the global  regional and national levels remains anissue of top priority. Tajikistan intends to continue tocontribute to the implementation of the relevantdecisions of Johannesburg and other internationalforums. The 2005-2015 International Decade forAction  “Water for Life”  to be launched on 22 March2005  was initiated by our country and is expected tocombine efforts undertaken by Governments  theUnited Nations  international organizations  civilsociety and the private sector. These efforts are aimedat identifying effective ways of achieving theinternationally agreed goals in the area of fresh waterresources  developing strategies  programmes and lawsto protect water environments and increasinginvestment and voluntary donor contributions  twoactivities associated with ensuring access to freshwater to all persons in need. We ask the Governmentsof all countries  as well as United Nations agencies  toundertake practical activities within this decade. Thisis the key to success  and it will require a great deal ofwork.In some regions of the world  the internationalcommunity is faced not only with the problem ofconflicts and wars that interfere with long-termdevelopment  but also with illicit drug trafficking which poses a threat to civil society. We cannot helpbeing concerned with the fact that global demand forprohibited drugs is not decreasing. For instance  thevolume of criminal transit of narcotics via Tajikistanconstitutes a serious threat to our social  political andeconomic stability as well as to the security of theregion as a whole. Afghanistan remains a majorsupplier of narcotics. Their production this year has seta record.The President of Tajikistan  Mr. EmomaliRakhmonov  regards the struggle against illicit drugs asone of the top priorities for our country. Thanks to thecooperation with the United Nations and interactionwithin Shanghai Cooperation Organization of the lastfive years  Tajikistan has become one of the leadingcountries in the world in terms of narcoticsinterdiction. Over this period  the law enforcementbodies of Tajikistan and the Russian border guardshave confiscated about 40 tons of narcotics  withheroin constituting more than half of this total. As aresult  millions of dollars have been removed from11circulation and hundreds of thousands of people theworld over have been saved from narcoticsdependency.According to Antonio Maria Costa  ExecutiveDirector of the United Nations Office on Drugs andCrime  Tajikistan sets a good example for othercountries as to how one can successfully struggleagainst drugs. The achievements of Tajikistan in thisarea are considered as a good basis for strengtheningthe struggle against the narcotics threat  but we arecombating the results rather than the roots of theproblem.In autumn 2005  heads of State and Governmentwill meet in this General Assembly Hall to discussprogress in achieving the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. We attach great importance to this event  whichcoincides with the sixtieth anniversary of thefoundation of the United Nations. We expect thisforthcoming event to give the necessary politicalimpetus to the international community in its progresstowards the achievement through combined efforts ofthe Millennium Development Goals in the interest of amore stable  just and prosperous world."
"169",6846,"TKM",59,2004,"I should like at the outset to express my sinceregratitude for the honour to speak from this rostrum andto convey  on behalf of the President of Turkmenistan Mr. Saparmurat Niyazov  best wishes for peace andprosperity to the peoples of all nations. I should alsolike to congratulate the President of the GeneralAssembly on his election to that lofty and responsiblepost and to wish him every success in fruitfully guidingthe work of the fifty-ninth session.The events taking place in the world today  whichare influencing the development of every region andevery country  attest to the dramatic changes that haveoccurred in the meaning of the historical process undernew conditions. Our ability to elaborate and implementqualitatively new approaches to interaction within thecommunity of nations will largely determine the degreeto which security and stability are maintainedthroughout the world. In that context  an immutableprinciple and basic direction for Turkmenistan’sforeign policy remains the strengthening anddevelopment of close cooperation with the United5Nations. I should like to take this opportunity to thankthe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisconstant support for the peace-loving foreign policy ofTurkmenistan.We should note that among the priority areas ofour country’s cooperation with the United Nations aremaintaining international peace and security andpreventing or resolving conflicts through politicalmeans and processes. With regard to those issues Turkmenistan has often become a centre where  underthe aegis of the United Nations and with theparticipation of its Special Representatives  effectivenegotiations have been carried out to resolve complexsituations that have taken place in the countries of ourregion.During the present general debate  it has beennoted several times that one of today’s major threats tointernational security and stability is terrorism.Following the events of 11 September 2001 Turkmenistan was one of the first countries to supportthe United Nations initiative of establishing aninternational coalition to fight terrorism  in which wehave taken an active part.In that context  Turkmenistan not only firmlycondemns any act of terrorism in any part of the world but also is undertaking specific legislative and practicalmeasures aimed at fighting that evil and preventing itfrom spreading. That is particularly relevant  given thatthe security conditions of the world community aredetermined by each country’s actual contribution to thestrengthening of its own internal stability  together withcooperation at the collective level. This is why webelieve that there is a need today to draw up aqualitatively new dimension  both between individualStates and within the framework of their joint activityin international organizations.Despite the fact that terrorism is multifaceted  itsnature is one and the same  and at its roots lie adoctrinaire egoism which has been raised by itsfollowers to the highest level of evil  intolerance andcruelty. Terrorism recognizes no State and nonationality; it is not affiliated with any religion orculture. This is why the war on terrorism and terroristsmust be conducted through joint efforts.It is precisely through the close coordination ofactions of members of the international community  onthe basis of norms of international law  that theestablishment of a situation in the world can beconducted in such a way that any manifestation ofterrorism will be punished and  as a result  it will bepossible to take effective measures to combat it. Here Turkmenistan favours effective implementation of abroad-ranging system of measures to combat terrorism including active cooperation in finding and bringing tojustice the organizers and perpetrators of terrorist acts.To counteract international terrorism  and toprotect the rights and freedoms of our citizens  wemust be able to forestall each of its manifestations andcounter it  not only through universal unanimouscondemnation  but also through a high degree ofprofessionalism of law enforcement agencies  and alsothrough the active use of the entire international legalarray of instruments drawn up within the framework ofthe United Nations.Further involvement of the role of the UnitedNations is becoming clearer against the backdrop ofthe present development of both global and regionalprocesses that require the concentration of collectiveefforts and the adoption of decisions  taking intoaccount a multitude of interests. Here  the fundamentalprinciples of international cooperation enshrined in theCharter and the criteria tested by time concerningmaintaining the balance of interests are a high priorityfor us. By following such a policy  Turkmenistanalways attempts fully to utilize the potential of thecommunity of nations and institutions in proposing andimplementing foreign policy initiatives.We see vast potential in the close partnershipwith the United Nations and its specialized structuresin implementing joint programmes and projects. In thiscontext  we would like to express our gratitude forcooperation extended to us by such United Nationsspecialized agencies as the United NationsDevelopment Programme  UNICEF  the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  theUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and theUnited Nations Population Fund. Through interactionwith these agencies  the Government of Turkmenistanis implementing a number of major projects that areyielding specific results in the social sphere  healthcare  education  the environment  combating illicit drugtrafficking and a number of other areas. Turkmenistanwill continue to maintain close ties with these UnitedNations agencies in the quest for and implementationof new possibilities for cooperation.6A clear example of the strategic partnership ofTurkmenistan with the United Nations was the signingof our country’s Government in February of 2004 ofthe United Nations Development AssistanceFramework to promote development for 2005-2009. Asignificant feature of this document is the fact that itfully coincides with the national priorities and interestsof Turkmenistan  as defined by the NationalDevelopment Strategy of our country for the perioduntil 2020. It aims at resolving global objectives withinthe framework of the United Nations MillenniumDevelopment Goals.One of the important components ofTurkmenistan’s policy is the human dimension. Ourcountry is conducting joint work with internationalorganizations in this area. During the years ofindependence  we have worked to create genuineguarantees for the implementation of personal political  economic  social and other rights of citizens.The personal rights of citizens have been specificallyreflected in Turkmenistan’s laws and law enforcementpractice concerning such matters as the abolition of thedeath penalty  the banning of searches on citizens andthe banning of the adoption of ad hoc decisions inpressing criminal charges. Through practical action Turkmenistan reaffirms the implementation of theselegal acts.Every year in our country  by presidential decree there is a widespread amnesty  the next to take place injust a month. As a result  more than 9 000 people willbe amnestied.Today in Turkmenistan there are no restrictionswhatsoever on travel of its citizens abroad. There isguaranteed freedom of registration and activity ofreligious organizations and groups  in accordance withuniversally recognized international law  regardless ofthe number of adherents or of their faith. A number ofvery important legislative acts were adopted regardingthese issues  in accordance with which  at the presenttime in Turkmenistan  there are various religious faithsregistered and functioning.As for the human dimension  Turkmenistan hasintensified its work with the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights(OHCHR). On our invitation  in March 2004 Turkmenistan was visited by a group of experts fromthe OHCHR  who  together with the Turkmen side drew up specific areas for cooperation and renderedassistance in work on the further development of thishuman dimension  among which was methodologicaland legal assistance in the preparation of nationalreports on United Nations conventions in the field ofhuman rights. We intend to continue our effortsregarding these issues and are ready to cooperate withall of the United Nations agencies and otherinternational organizations.Against the backdrop of such effectiveinteraction  we are concerned that in 2003 the GeneralAssembly’s Third Committee considered a draftresolution regarding human rights in Turkmenistan.The proposal was made by representatives of severalcountries without having visited Turkmenistan  withouthaving studied the situation on the ground  withouttaking into account the significant initiatives of theGovernment of Turkmenistan in this sphere andwithout having first acquainted the Turkmen side withits contents. Such attempts at a one-sided considerationof serious questions is  in our view  unacceptable  andit is not in keeping with constructive cooperation inthis sphere. The adoption of hasty decisions does notmake a positive contribution to constructive dialogue.This is extremely important  particularly in the light ofthe principle of mutual respect for States  one of thedominating principles in the system of values professedby the United Nations.At the crossroads of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries  our region  Central Asia  has movedinto the forefront of the international community’sattention. How multilateral dialogue will take place onproblems of this region to a great extent will determinethe prospects for peace and security on a global scale.Aware of its full responsibility to theinternational community  Turkmenistan attaches utmostimportance to the role of the United Nations instepping up regional and interregional dialogue inseeking solutions to potential problems. In this regard I should like to draw the Assembly’s attention to theinitiative of the President of Turkmenistan regardingthe creation of a Central Asian regional consultativecouncil of heads of State.The issue here is about the creation of an inter-State body at the highest level for holding regularconsultations and working out joint decisions onrelevant issues that directly affect the fate of thecountries of the region and the real needs of the peoplethat inhabit those regions. These are  first of all  issues7of cooperation in trade and the economy  energysupply  border trade  transportation and humanitarianissues. In our view  this mechanism for multilateralconsultations at the head-of-State level would promotethe development and implementation of agreed actionsby parties on the basis of mutual interest and wouldallow for creation of the most effective system ofrational interaction.In October 2003  in Ashkhabad  the first round ofa forum on conflict prevention and sustainabledevelopment for Central Asia took place under theaegis of the United Nations and the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). In thecontext of strengthening the effectiveness ofinstruments of preventive diplomacy  we believe it tobe useful and advisable to create a United Nationscentre on preventive diplomacy in the Central Asianregion. Turkmenistan is ready to provide full assistancetowards locating it in our nation’s capital.An important stage in intensifying regionalcooperation was the preparation of the trans-Afghan —or Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan — gas pipelineproject. Turkmenistan welcomes the interest of largecompanies and financial and industrial groups in thatmajor project. Here  I would like to note that theUnited Nations  using its broad international authority could have worked out a system of political and legalguarantees to ensure conditions favourable to theproject.It is important to recall that in the pastTurkmenistan proposed  from this rostrum  an initiativeto formulate and adopt under the aegis of the UnitedNations an international convention on a regimegoverning the functioning of inter-State pipelines  andassociated guarantees. We believe that such adocument would make it possible to create adependable political and legal mechanism to ensure thetransportation of raw materials to world markets.On the question of implementing a securedevelopment strategy and enhancing cooperation in theregion  I would like to underscore issues ofinternational cooperation regarding the Caspian Sea.These relate first and foremost to the exploration of theCaspian Sea’s richest fields of hydrocarbon resourcesand are linked not only to the interests of the countriesof the region but to those of many other States andtransnational companies. Our policy is aimed atmerging those interests.It is a well-known fact that the oil and natural gasreserves of the Caspian Sea are the planet’s mostimportant energy resources for the twenty-first century.Their reasonable and effective exploration and theconstruction of pipeline infrastructure to transport themto world markets would ensure significant economicgrowth in many States and the well-being of theirpeoples.Effective economic activity on the Caspian Sea isclosely linked to ensuring stability in the Caspianregion. Turkmenistan favours making the Caspian Seaa zone of peace  stability and sustainable internationalcooperation.We share the view that  in the twenty-firstcentury  the United Nations system needs rationalreform. We favour such United Nations reform  butonly in terms of strengthening and broadening theOrganization’s role in the world. In this context  animportant issue is ensuring maximum representation ofStates in the United Nations  in the broader communityof nations  in the specialized agencies and in theUnited Nations system in general. In addition  theUnited Nations should make full use of the potentialand advantages of Member States. For example Turkmenistan is ready to provide United Nationsagencies with resources to expand their presence in theregion by opening headquarters and other major officesof United Nations agencies in our capital.The diversity and complexity of the tasks facingthe States Members of the United Nations is self-evident. Carrying them out requires not only collectiveefforts but also unambiguous awareness of theindividual role and responsibility of each country ofthe international community. Turkmenistan adheres tothat logic of political behaviour  with the objective ofstrengthening peace and promoting economic  socialand cultural development."
"170",6859,"TLS",59,2004,"In view oftime constraints  I shall share an abbreviated version ofmy speech. The full text is being distributed in theHall. Please forgive me for skipping the usual formalgreetings to all the deserving dignitaries.I first walked into this building in December1975  in the midst of a North American winter  havingnever seen snow in my life  to appear before theSecurity Council. I learned then  and since  that not allUnited Nations resolutions are implemented. But I alsolearned that  in spite of its shortcomings and failings the United Nations offers us hope and that we mustcling to that hope  for it gives us the strength and thecourage to continue.When the Secretary-General visited Timor-Lestein May 2002 to preside over the formal transfer ofsovereignty to our elected President  I said to him:“Mr. Secretary-General  you are going to lose your jobas President of Timor-Leste”. I can assure membersthat Kofi Annan did not seem too upset to berelinquishing that unpaid and difficult job. We thankhim for his wise stewardship of Timor-Leste’stransition to independence.We cannot fail to pay tribute to our belovedfriend  Sergio Vieira de Mello  who was brutallymurdered in Iraq just over a year ago. Our people weptover his death  but Sergio will always live in us. Hispassage through Timor-Leste  his charisma  energy andsmile will be with us forever. Our tribute goes also toall the United Nations personnel who lost their lives inour country and in many other difficult regions aroundthe world.We offer our sincere condolences and solidarityto Russia  Spain  Indonesia and Australia — the latestvictims in a seemingly endless catalogue of barbaritycommitted by fanatics.It was only a little over two years ago thatSecretary-General Kofi Annan handed over power toour elected President. Since then  we have made realprogress in several sectors  such as publicadministration  education and health. Yet  we arefailing in other areas.The most fragile sector of the Administration inTimor-Leste is the judiciary. We have very few trainedjudges  prosecutors or lawyers. We are committed tocreating a strong and independent judiciary  but thatachievement is still many years off. We thank thosecountries that have assisted us in improving ourjudiciary and we implore them to continue their effortsfor many years to come.Our economy is limping along  although it isdoing much better than anticipated. We are confidentthat in two to three years we will experience strongeconomic growth as a result of revenues from oil andgas  as well as capital investment in publicinfrastructure  including roads  bridges  ports andairports  telecommunications  public housing  health agriculture  fisheries and tourism. We should then beable to begin drastically reducing unemployment andpoverty.Here we wish to congratulate the Indonesianpeople and their leaders for their great experiment indemocracy. Few imagined in 1999 that within only afew years the fourth largest nation in the world — andthe largest Muslim country — would emerge as avibrant democracy.Talks are under way between Australia andTimor-Leste to rectify our differing interpretations ofinternational law and State practice as regards maritimeboundaries between coastal States. Timor-Leste sharesthe view of the majority of the internationalcommunity that  where there are overlapping claimsbetween two coastal States  the principle ofequidistance should apply.Allow me now to address some issues that are ofconcern to us. In the past 20 years or so  our world hasbeen the stage for several major conflicts  including theinvasion of Iran by Saddam Hussein in the 1980s which resulted in the death of over a million people.Chemical and biological weapons were unleashed onboth civilians and combatants. Soon after the end ofthe Iraq-Iran war  the same regime in Baghdadlaunched another invasion  this time against the Stateof Kuwait. Most of us have now relegated theCambodian tragedy of the 1970s to a footnote in ourintellectual memory  but let us not forget the almostuniversal indifference of the international community16to the genocide unleashed by the Khmer Rouge inCambodia.Like many of you  and millions of peacemarchers  we are opposed to violence and wars. But wemust ask ourselves some troubling questions. Shouldwe oppose the use of force even in the face of genocideand ethnic cleansing? In the eternal dilemma of warand peace there are pacifists and idealists who opposethe use of force under any circumstances and there arethe realists who support the use of force under certaincircumstances  namely  if it has been sanctioned by theSecurity Council. Those who are absolutely against theuse of force have been unable to articulate a betterstrategy for dealing with the savagery of ethniccleansing and genocide. Patient diplomacy lasts as longas it lasts; it might bear fruit  or it might not. Genocide however  continues as we can see in the Sudan wherethousands of our fellow human beings are dying rightnow.In the tragic case of Cambodia in the 1970s  theworld knew that an evil regime was deliberatelypurging the nation and murdering hundreds ofthousands of innocent human beings. Yet  the SecurityCouncil never even discussed the Khmer Rougegenocide. Around the same time as the Cambodiantragedy  genocide was taking place on the Africancontinent  in Uganda. The Security Council neitherdebated nor took any action on the situation in Ugandaunder Idi Amin. It required the moral courage of aJulius Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania toput an end to Idi Amin’s genocidal rule. We would ask if there had been a lone world leader with the moralcourage to order his country’s armed forces tointervene in Rwanda in 1994  would he have beenhailed as a saviour or vilified as an aggressor?In selectively recalling some of the most flagrantcases of our collective failure to prevent wars andgenocide  our sole intention is to provoke reflection onthe failings and weaknesses of the United Nations witha view to exploring ways of making our Organization amore effective custodian of world peace.Allow us to add some thoughts to the ongoingdebate as to how we can realize an improved UnitedNations. We wish  however  to preface our views onUnited Nations reform by stating that we do notbelieve that a simple expansion of Security Councilmembership will suffice to strengthen the UnitedNations. It may make the Council more representativeby better reflecting current global demographics andpower-balances  but it will not necessarily make itmore effective.That said  there is a clear need to expandmembership in the Security Council for non-permanentand permanent members. Timor-Leste fully supportsthe Franco-German initiative on United Nationsreforms. We also believe that the new expandedSecurity Council should include countries likeGermany  India  Indonesia  Japan  Brazil and one ortwo from the African continent. But  to reassure you  Ishould add that Timor-Leste is not seeking a permanentseat in the Security Council for itself — please do notworry about that.We particularly support permanent membershipstatus for Indonesia because we believe in the need forbalanced representation within the Security Council encompassing all the world’s major civilizations andfaiths. Non-inclusion of Indonesia — the largestsecular Muslim country in the world — as a newpermanent member would again leave the SecurityCouncil with a predominantly Christian representation.Incidentally  my Government has alreadyreceived requests for support for a seat in Council foras far ahead as 2020 and 2024. Moreover  on the basisof the two-year rotation arrangement  it seems thatTimor-Leste  and many other small nations  will onlybe able to offer its services to the Security Councilsomewhere in 2049. Incidentally  we are very touchedthat many delegations have already expressed supportfor Timor-Leste for 2049.The world is faced with a growing AIDSpandemic  the epicentre of which is now shifting toAsia. Moreover  malaria and tuberculosis have beenwith us for many generations  yet there is no realcommitment of resources that will enable our scientistsand societies to address those epidemics.The combined official development assistance(ODA) of the rich industrialized countries does notexceed US$ 50 billion annually. Compare that with themore than US$ 300 billion those countries provide insubsidies to their farmers and industries.Weapons-producing countries are flooding theworld with all types of arms that fuel conflicts. Theremust be a strict code of conduct on weapons exportsaimed at reducing the flow of conventional weapons topoor countries and regions in conflict.17We in Timor-Leste do not wish to soundungrateful  but we have reason to be sceptical aboutODA that ends up back in the donor metropolis withonly a fraction of that much-publicized aid benefitingthe recipient country. There has to be a thoroughreform of ODA with a view to ensuring that developingcountries actually receive what is pledged. We wondersometimes about the usefulness of the endlessmeetings  study trips  evaluations  feasibility studiesand other activities  when  in reality  all theinformation required can be downloaded from theInternet by a 7-year-old child. Actually my 10-year-oldniece  Sarah  does most of the Internet searches for meand instead of paying an international consultantsomething like $1 000 a day in consulting fees  she ishappy with two scoops of chocolate ice cream.We join with the leaders of Brazil  Chile  France Spain and others in urging the rich of the North toallocate 0.7 per cent of their national wealth to ODA thus meeting the target set by the United Nations. It isperplexing that only four small rich countries have metand/or exceeded that modest target.Europe and the United States should graduallyeliminate all agricultural subsidies to their farmers thatkill competition and market access of poor countries.We understand the political difficulties faced by somefriends in Europe and the United States when dealingwith the issue of subsidies. Hence  we believe thatdeveloping countries  the European Union and theUnited States should be able to reach a reasonablecompromise on this issue.We conclude our remarks with reference to someinternational situations. Regarding the ongoing conflictin Western Sahara  we endorse the comments made byHis Excellency President Abdelaziz Bouteflika ofAlgeria  a country that has contributed enormously tothe liberation of the African continent. On this issue our Government is guided by Algeria and the AfricanUnion.We appeal to our senior Asian leaders  inparticular  China  India  Japan  Republic of Korea andthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations to redoubletheir efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the conflictin Myanmar.On the subject of sanctions  we wish to appeal toour friends in the United States Congress to rise abovetheir parochial politics and lift all forms of sanctionson Cuba.There is deep-seated resentment and anger amongMuslims and many non-Muslims around the world overIsrael’s policies that thwart Palestinian right to adignified existence and homeland.The two-State solution agreed upon by all sideshas to be rapidly resurrected and implemented as a firststep towards durable peace in the region. ThePalestinian intifada and suicide-bombing  as well as theIsraeli policy of annexation and retaliation  havedeepened the anger and hatred. There has to be a wayout.We hope that the United States  which initiatedthe war in Iraq and gallantly freed the Iraqi peoplefrom a tyrant  will go half-way and meet those on theother side of the debate. The United States and itsallies should not shoulder the burden of Iraq alone.The Euro-Atlantic partnership is the single mostimportant pillar of the world’s security and economicwell-being. Americans and Europeans share the samevalues of democracy and freedom. Surely  they arewise enough to overcome their differences  howeverdeep  and give the Iraqi people a chance to finally befree and at peace among themselves and with theirneighbours. May God Almighty Bless You All."
"171",6875,"TON",59,2004,"I congratulateyou  Sir  on your presidency and know well that we arein excellent hands. I should also like to pay tribute toMr. Julian Hunte for his excellent stewardship of thefifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.We are enthusiastic at the forthcoming 10-yearreview of the Barbados Programme of Action. We seeit as an extension and implementation of the4commitments agreed to in the Johannesburg Plan ofImplementation and  in particular  in its chapter VII.Whilst the developmental path to Mauritius in January2005 has been fraught with its own challenges  it iscritical to small island developing States that theimpetus for that important global review not be lost inits own rhetoric. It is paramount that the outcomesfrom Mauritius be refined and focused on translatingthe oft-quoted special case of small island developingStates into firm and timely support and globalimplementation. As such  participation by all memberStates in the forthcoming preparatory process and inthe International Meeting in Mauritius is essential torealizing our development aspirations.The geographical makeup of small island Statesputs some of our islands at a disadvantage. That isbecause economic development has focused on largerislands with large populations  which thereby enjoy ahigher per capita income than do other islands of thecountry. That is true of Tonga  where the main focus ofdevelopment has been devoted to the larger islands ofthe three main island groups  but within each of thosethree groups other islands need further economicdevelopment. Three remote islands to the north  knownas the Niuas  are disadvantaged by the tyranny ofdistance and are in fact in closer proximity to Samoathan they are to our own capital. The outlying islandsof the Vava’u and Ha’apai groups are less developedthan their main islands  while `Eua to the south-east ofTongatapu has potential but needs targeted inputs.Though we have designated core donors to thoseislands  their further development will need additionalor new resources. So I hope that  in the review of theBarbados Programme of Action  some thought is givento the lot of those living on these disadvantagedislands.As a developing ocean State  we are vigilantabout progress in ocean affairs and law of the seaissues. We consider the valuable contribution made bythe meeting of States parties to the Convention on theLaw of the Sea and its subsidiary bodies — inparticular  the achievements of the InternationalSeabed Authority  to whose mandate a researchfunction should be added  and the work of theCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf —worthy of mention. Together with the important role ofthe United Nations Open-ended Informal ConsultativeProcess  this sets a firm and practical platform for ourwork during this session.I am happy to note that the third informal meetingof States parties to the United Nations Fish StocksAgreement has seen firm commitments by certainStates Parties to enable the implementation andconcrete operation of elements of part VII of theAgreement with special emphasis on and relevance tosmall island developing States. We continue toencourage other member States to become parties tothe Agreement.We are particularly pleased that the Conventionfor the Conservation and Management of HighlyMigratory Fish Stocks in the Western and CentralPacific Ocean entered into force earlier this year. Weconsider that special milestone worthy of note in theAssembly’s work.Wanton acts of terrorism continue to test ourfortitude as members of the international community.We must remain collectively resolute in our resolve toprevent and vigorously combat the proponents of thatevil  and we must be innovative and versatile in ourpursuit of meaningful countermeasures and lastingsolutions.We continue to strongly support the work of theCounter-Terrorism Committee and applaud the recentrevitalization of it and its work. Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001) remains the basis of domesticmeasures implemented by my Government  includingthe submission of country and  where appropriate regional reports. It is useful to identify areas wherefinancial and technical assistance is necessary toenable stronger compliance by all States in meetingtheir international obligations.After eight years of negotiations  Tonga’saccession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is inthe final stages. Bilateral market access agreements ongoods and services have been concluded withAustralia  Canada  the European Union  Japan  NewZealand and Panama. Agreement with the UnitedStates is outstanding  as it has requested that we accedeto the Chemical Harmonization Agreement and theInformation Technology Agreement. Although this isan additional burden on us  we do understand that theUnited States is requesting the same commitmentsfrom every acceding country. The working groupreport has been discussed at informal working partiesand so gives rise to cautious optimism that we couldconclude the process before the 2005 ministerialmeeting.5Tonga needs the understanding and the support ofall WTO members as we seek commitmentscommensurate with the size of our economy and thestage of our development. To be sure  Tonga is notseeking greater market access  but desires security forits trade under a rule-based  multilateral tradingsystem.Tonga adheres strictly to the “one China” policyand recognizes that Taiwan is an inalienable part ofChina. We welcome the shared principle of non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and  assuch  we consider that delicate and sensitive issues arebest dealt with in an across-the-Strait dialogue ratherthan at international forums.We welcome the expanding cooperation withChina and recognize that its huge market provides arange of commercial  financial and trade possibilitiesfor us and  to that end  Tonga has adopted a “look east”policy. To give effect to its interests in China  Tongawill soon establish a diplomatic presence in Beijing toexplore those interests further.For a decade now  we have exported our squashproduce to Japan and  more recently  we have beenexporting specially cultivated seaweed to its markets. Itis timely that we now explore further forms ofcooperation with Japan in the field of fisheries  trade inother produce  financial and investment possibilities  aswell as education and training. To pursue thoseinterests  we are giving thought to a possible presencein Tokyo  although such an undertaking will bedetermined by available financial resources. The policydoes not supplant the long-existing warm ties offriendship we enjoy with Australia  New Zealand France and the United States in the Pacific region  asthose friendly ties and a broad range of cooperation arefirmly rooted in our policy.My Government has approved the fourthdeployment later in the year of police officers to theRegional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands(RAMSI). Also  approval has been given for thedeployment of the third contingent of defencepersonnel for 2005  in concert with the agreed rotationformula under RAMSI.We all look forward to the report of the High-Level Panel. Judging from the makeup of the Panel andits formidable credentials  I should think the report andrecommendations will set the tone for the constructiveengagement of the General Assembly.The membership of the Security Council ought tobe expanded in both the permanent and non-permanentcategories in accordance with the realities of the dayand perceptions of tomorrow. We believe that Japanshould be a permanent member and that there shouldbe a permanent seat for Africa and another for LatinAmerica.Five years ago  Tonga was admitted tomembership of the United Nations and has sinceactively participated in United Nations activities. It isnow giving favourable consideration to contributing tothe United Nations peacekeeping efforts. Consequently arrangements for our participation will be discussedfurther with the United Nations. The scope of ourdeployment will be fashioned by our availablemanpower and financial capacity.Although violence renders an enduring peaceelusive  we continue to harbour hopes that a lastingpeace can soon be concluded so that a Palestinian Statecan be established  living side by side with the State ofIsrael in internationally recognized borders and inpeace and security.Our development has been made possible throughdomestic resources and also through bilateral andmultilateral programmes of assistance  all of whichhave been highly appreciated. Our major donorpartners have been Australia  China  the EuropeanUnion — with some members providing additionalassistance — Japan and New Zealand. The UnitedStates provides assistance through its fisheries treatywith the Pacific region and through other avenues. Inrecent times  India  Indonesia  Singapore and Malaysiahave provided technical assistance. The United NationsDevelopment Programme  the Global EnvironmentFacility  the United Nations Environment Programme the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS  theWorld Health Organization  the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  theGlobal Fund  the World Bank and other financialinstitutions have provided various forms of assistanceand technical expertise. Much of the technicalassistance is channelled to combating diabetes andtuberculosis and preventing the spread of theHIV/AIDS. Other assistance has been directed atmeeting our Millennium Development Goals and tosmall community programmes and projects."
"172",6915,"TTO",59,2004,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Government and thepeople of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  Iextend congratulations to Mr. Ping on his election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. We are confident that his experience anddiplomatic skills will enable him to discharge fully theweighty responsibilities of his office.Permit me to convey to his predecessor  TheHonourable Julian Hunte  Minister of Foreign Affairsof Saint Lucia  our deep appreciation of his effortstowards revitalization of the General Assembly.I wish also to convey to our Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  the full support of the Governmentand the people of Trinidad and Tobago as he continuesthe global initiatives of the United Nations towardsmaking the world better and safer for all humanity.Today Trinidad and Tobago is celebrating itstwenty-eighth anniversary as a republic. Over our 42years as an independent country  we have madesignificant strides in the development of our nation. Wehave maintained a strong tradition of democratic7governance through an increasingly inclusive andmultiparty political system; by respecting fully theconstitutionally entrenched and internationallyrecognized fundamental human rights and freedoms ofthe individual; and by ensuring strict adherence to therule of law.We have sought increasingly to diversify oureconomic base. Through consistent and sound macro-economic policies  together with prudent managementand use of our resources  we have sustained more thana decade of positive economic growth  which last yearwas of the order of 13.2 per cent.Our country has made significant strides inadvancing the capabilities of our people throughuniversal access to primary and secondary education.We have gone further through our State-sponsoredpreschool programme  which targets universal earlychildhood education by 2010  and by fully opening thegateway to tertiary education through support for everystudent  enhanced funding for deserving ones  and ourrecently established University of Trinidad andTobago.Our archipelagic Republic  populated by 1.3million people of African  Indian  European  Chinese Middle Eastern and mixed ancestries  constitutes averitable microcosm of the people of the world.However  we have been able to foster racial harmonyand religious tolerance through the collective embraceof the diversity of our people.That approach  together with adherence tointegrity and transparency in public affairs and equalityof opportunity for all  has been essential to thecontinued peace  stability and progress we enjoy as wepropose to make Trinidad and Tobago a beacon ofintegrity in the world.Trinidad and Tobago has demonstratedremarkable strength and resilience in the face of aglobal environment characterized by rapid economic social and other changes; this has mobilized us toembark on the realization of a bold new vision in thepursuit of our developmental agenda. In that respect our Government and people are currently engaged in ahighly participatory consultative process aimed atformulating a National Strategic Development Plan toguide Trinidad and Tobago towards becoming adeveloped nation by the year 2020 or earlier.It is called Vision 2020  and its agenda includeshuman capital development; the evolution of atechnologically driven  knowledge-based society; thedevelopment of a highly productive and globallycompetitive economy; and  by the year 2020  theprovision for all our citizens of a standard of livingcomparable to that enjoyed in developed countries.Our achievements stand in indisputable testimonyto what a small  independent nation such as ours can doin that regard. There is an instructive link between twoof the features that today define and distinguish ourcountry among others in the region. One is our oil andnatural gas resources — the foundation and mainstayof our economy; the other  the steelpan  our creationderived from heating and tuning the top of discardedoil drums.The steelpan is one of the most important musicalinstruments invented during the last century. We areproud to have created it  and equally so of its growinginternational recognition and popularity  which is anapt reflection of the phenomenal ingenuity of thepeoples of developing countries.The same holds true in respect of achievements inour energy sector. At just over 130 000 barrels of oilper day  Trinidad and Tobago’s production is notsignificant by international standards. Our natural gasproduction  however  stands at 2.9 billion cubic feetper day  and that has propelled my country to becometoday the world’s largest exporter of methanol and alsoof ammonia. We are currently supplying 80 per cent ofUnited States liquid natural gas imports out of ourthree trains  and we propose to leverage that facttowards Caribbean regional development. We are also acritical supplier of energy to our Caribbean neighbours.To further facilitate this  we are exploring thefeasibility of several energy-related projects  includingthe establishment of a natural gas pipeline through theeastern Caribbean. We have also entered into a jointventure with neighbouring Venezuela to liquefy thatcountry’s natural gas in Trinidad and Tobago.Meanwhile  our iron and steel productionfacilities are being expanded. Several new productionfacilities are in train  among them an ethyleneproduction complex  an aluminium smelter project  andothers for expanded ammonia and methanol productionas well as other downstream petrochemical products.The combination of an attractive and enablinginvestment climate  available and affordable energy  a8strategic location vis-à-vis the North  Central andSouth American and European markets  a populationliteracy level of over 90 per cent  and a sound workethic  as well as a good communications infrastructure continue to make Trinidad and Tobago one of thelargest per-capita recipients of foreign directinvestment in the hemisphere. Indeed  last year wewere the second-largest recipient after Canada.Like other countries we  too  have our fair shareof challenges. For example  our strategic location —less than nine miles off the South American coast andto the south of the Caribbean island chain  withexcellent air and sea transport links to major NorthAtlantic cities — renders Trinidad and Tobago highlyvulnerable to trade in illegal drugs and firearms.Combating narco-trafficking  drug-related crimes andthe spread of HIV/AIDS is among our greatestchallenges  but the Government of Trinidad andTobago remains resolute in its determination toeradicate those scourges. We continue to implement themeasures necessary to fight them and are confident thatwe shall win the battle.Our development agenda is not centred solely onthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is part andparcel of a pan-Caribbean agenda to which we areirrevocably and solidly committed  and which takesinto consideration the fullest development of thecountries of our region. Many historical and other tiesbind our Caribbean nations and we understand that thefundamental basis for our development lies in beingable to work more closely together to exert a greaterinfluence on our own as well as global development which for centuries have been dictated by others.Today  our level of functional cooperation in theregion has increased over a range of areas and Trinidadand Tobago continues to play a central role at alllevels. We therefore look forward to theoperationalization of our newest Caribbean institution the Caribbean Court of Justice  which will serve as thearbitral body for the soon-to-be-established CARICOMSingle Market and Economy  as well as the region’sfinal appellate Court  and will be headquartered in Portof Spain.The development of Trinidad and Tobago andCARICOM are intertwined. CARICOM is our secondlargest export market after the United States ofAmerica  absorbing close to 20 per cent of our exports.Our share of regional trade grew to 80 per cent in2001. Since 1996  we have contributed approximatelyUS$ 1.4 billion in assistance to Caribbean Statesthrough a variety of mechanisms including capitalmarket activities  foreign direct investment  debt relief and direct assistance. Last year we provided US$ 505million in loans to companies and Governments in theregion  some of whom have difficulty in borrowing onthe international market. In addition  we have recentlyestablished a new grant facility  to be based on sales ofpetroleum products to the region  which will bededicated to poverty eradication within CARICOM.My country sees the development of theCaribbean  our second largest market  as integral to thedevelopment of Trinidad and Tobago. Even so  ournational and regional development efforts require aninternational economic environment of greatersensitivity  one facilitating a more beneficialintegration of developing countries into the worldeconomy. In that regard  as sanguine as we are aboutthe future of Trinidad and Tobago  I must on thisoccasion take a stand in the interest of the beleaguerednations of the Caribbean. How often have smallindependent States preached from this verymountaintop of the need for multilateral tradingarrangements that take into account the inherentvulnerabilities of small island developing States  andconsequently the need to be accorded special anddifferential treatment? There is a notable reluctance ofsome partner countries to respond accordingly  and thatcontinues to have negative consequences  especiallyfor the small economies of the Caribbean.Trinidad and Tobago therefore stands resolutewith our developing country partners in calling forwhat must be conceived of as the application of asocial conscience within the management ofglobalization and its processes. As capital importingeconomies  the developing countries of the Caribbeanare only too well aware  sometimes painfully so  of theimplications of capital shortage for the generation ofemployment and the provision of housing  educationand health care for our citizens. And perhaps I speakeven for those yet unborn.It is through softer trading arrangements increased financial flows and the consequentempowerment of our citizens that we will be able torealize the most central of all the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  the eradication of poverty. Theimplications are clear. The course on which some ofour European Union (EU) country partners are9embarked will render the achievement of ourMillennium Development Goals more difficult.In speaking of those goals our attention is nowdrawn to Haiti  our newest CARICOM member  whereover 1 000 people died from the onslaught ofHurricane Jeanne  further aggravating the tremendousproblems that that nation already suffers. Trinidad andTobago therefore welcomes the decision taken by theSecurity Council in its resolution 1542 (2004) of 30April 2004 to establish the United Nations StabilizationMission in Haiti. We also support the recent decisionby the Economic and Social Council to reactivate itsAd Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti to promote thecoordination and development of a long-termprogramme of assistance to that country. We believethat those efforts by the international community willcontribute significantly to the stability and urgentlyneeded development of Haiti.At this juncture  however  Haiti needs atremendous outpouring of international humanitarianassistance. The same holds true for Grenada andseveral other Caribbean States whose misfortune it wasto have been visited by “Ivan  the Terrible”. On8 September  Hurricane Ivan descended on Grenada. Inless than two hours it had completely destroyed theeconomy and infrastructure of Grenada  ravaging thatcountry beyond description. Ninety percent of thebuildings on the island were damaged or destroyed. Aprimarily agricultural economy  dependent also ontourism  all of Grenada’s crops disappeared with thestrong wind. CARICOM leaders were recently advisedby a Grenadian representative that today Grenada hasno gross domestic product.Before visiting Grenada  Hurricane Ivan —sowing varying amounts of disruption anddestruction — visited Tobago and Barbados. AfterGrenada  it proceeded to Saint Vincent and theGrenadines  Jamaica  the Cayman Islands  Cuba Bahamas and the southern United States. Everywherethere was considerable damage  but Grenada and theCayman Islands were the hardest hit.Before Ivan  there was Charley and Frances.After Ivan came Jeanne  with death and destruction forPuerto Rico  the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Anumber of CARICOM countries are now saddled withthe immense challenge of trying to restore normalcy.Permit me to ask  to what extent have theseobvious climate changes been influenced by incursionsinto space from planet Earth  or for that matter byecological imbalances caused by industrialization?In the aftermath of the devastation visited onGrenada  CARICOM countries have been rallying tothe assistance of that island  and must be applauded fortheir massive outpouring of humanitarian aid thatcontinues to flow to Grenada. In that regard  permit meto recognize and applaud the most appropriate responseof the Secretary-General.Trinidad and Tobago pledges its support to ourbeleaguered Caribbean neighbours  and we have thuscommitted ourselves through direct financial and otherassistance. But what Grenada and Haiti require is wellbeyond the region’s capacity to deliver. I urge thewider international community and donor agencies torespond adequately and to play their part. Help isneeded and needed now.The catastrophic events of the present hurricaneseason bring into sharper focus yet another dimensionof the vulnerability of Caribbean countries. TheJanuary 2005 International Meeting in Mauritius toreview the implementation of the Barbados Programmeof Action must seek to comprehensively address thenew and emerging threats to the sustainabledevelopment of small island developing States. Theinternational community should take note that a wholenew set of security issues have now arisen in theCaribbean as a result of those developments.The answer to so many of our problems lies inmultilateralism  if approached the right way. Belief inand respect for multilateralism led to Trinidad andTobago’s respect for all major global and regionalforums. Today  we are active participants in thecreation of the free trade area of the Americas  which when realized  will stretch from Alaska in the north toTierra del Fuego in the south  creating a market ofmore than 800 million consumers and generatingtremendous opportunity for economic and socialdevelopment.Our region’s commitment to that hemisphericintegration process has led Trinidad and Tobago and itspartners in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) topropose our capital city  Port-of-Spain  as the ideallocation for the seat of the proposed permanentsecretariat of the free trade area of the Americas.Unanimous regional support for this CARICOMproposal would demonstrate the hemisphere’s10solidarity with one of its smaller members and givetrue meaning to the principle of the sovereign equalityof all States. It would further decentralize theheadquartering of major international and regionalorganizations and enable a small island developingState to place its resources at the service of thehemispheric community. Accordingly  we look forwardto receiving the support of all our neighbours in thehemisphere.We remain pleased with the progress of certainmultilateral initiatives  including the New AfricanPartnership for Development  which I urge CARICOMand African countries to support by exploringopportunities to develop investment  trade  tourism andregular transport routes between our region and theAfrican continent.We also consider the establishment of theInternational Criminal Court to be a majorachievement  and we urge partner countries to upholdthe integrity of the Rome Statute. The commission ofwar crimes  genocide and other such crimes againsthumanity has been facilitated by a global culture ofimpunity. The people of the world will be safe onlywhen the perpetrators of such crimes know thatpunishment is inescapable.Trinidad and Tobago condemns all forms andmanifestations of terrorism  wherever and bywhomever they are committed. We are already a partyto the principal international legal instruments againstterrorism  and the Government will shortly takeparliamentary action to enact legislation honouring ourobligations with respect to the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism.As the international community continues toconfront the many threats to the survival of mankind the world’s political leadership must unequivocallyreaffirm its commitment to the United Nations so thatthe United Nations can continue its role in fightinginjustice  inequality  inequity and intoleranceworldwide through resolute and speedy action  inrespect of its commitment to the ideals for which it wasfounded.Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that the issueof United Nations reform takes on even more urgencyas the institution approaches the sixtieth anniversary ofits founding in 1945. We therefore look forward todiscussion of the Secretary-General’s recommendationsbased on the report of the High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change  chaired by former PrimeMinister Anand Panyarachun.In conclusion  I wish to propose that on 24October  2005  United Nations Day  a specialcommemorative meeting of the General Assembly beheld in San Francisco  where our Charter was signed to reaffirm our commitment to the lofty idealsenunciated some 50 years ago  which are still validtoday."
"173",6962,"TUN",59,2004,"It ismy honour to read out the statement of Mr. Zine ElAbidine Ben Ali  President of the Republic of Tunisiaand Chairman of the sixteenth session of the ArabLeague Council  who had wanted to attend this meetingbut was detained by urgent commitments. Thestatement reads as follows:“It is my distinct pleasure to convey to you Sir  and to your sisterly country  the Republic ofGabon  my sincere congratulations on yourelection as President of the General Assembly atthis session. We wish you every success.“I also wish to express to your predecessor Mr. Julian Hunte  my great appreciation for hisexcellent management of the proceedings of theprevious session.“I also take this opportunity to convey mythanks and appreciation to Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan for his commendable efforts topromote the role of the Organization and to fulfilits objectives of establishing security and peacethroughout the world.“Tunisia reiterates its commitment to theprinciples and purposes of the United NationsCharter and reaffirms its steady resolve tocontinue to contribute to all efforts to reform theOrganization and to develop its structures  theGeneral Assembly and the Security Council inparticular  so that it can remain the guarantor ofthe application of international law and theconsolidation of justice  stability anddevelopment throughout the world.“Faced with rising tensions in many regionsof the world  the widening development gapbetween countries and the serious challengesconfronting humankind  the internationalcommunity is called upon to reorganizeinternational relations in accordance with a newvision based on cooperation  solidarity andcoexistence among all peoples. That is theapproach which we sought to develop at theSummit Conference of the Arab League Councilhosted by my country on 22 and 23 May  thecurrent session of which we have the honour ofchairing.“In addition to the outcome of the ArabSummit  which represents a qualitative leap in thesystem of joint Arab action  the Arab States senta clear message to the international community.In it  they reaffirmed their commitment to a just comprehensive and lasting peace as a strategicoption in settling the Arab-Israeli conflict  basedon the Arab peace initiative  internationallegality  the relevant resolutions of the SecurityCouncil and the implementation of the road map.The community of Arab States is determined tointensify its international activities to reactivatethe Arab peace initiative and to rally internationalsupport for it.“The serious escalation of the situation inthe occupied Palestinian territories and Israel’sstubborn imposition of a policy of fait accompliand unilateral measures require the internationalcommunity to act promptly to end the violenceagainst and provide international protection forthe brotherly Palestinian people  to lift the siegeimposed on its legitimate leadership  to cease thebuilding of settlements and to recognize theadvisory opinion of the International Court ofJustice declaring the construction of theseparation wall illegal and calling for itsdemolition. We believe that this would help tocreate conditions conducive to the establishmentof a new era of confidence and understandingamong all parties in the region in which the peaceprocess can be resumed  the brotherly Palestinianpeople can recover its legitimate rights andestablish its independent State  and Syria andLebanon can recover all of their occupiedterritories.“While renewing its commitment tosupporting Iraq’s national unity and respect for itssovereignty and independence  the community ofArab States stresses the need for the UnitedNations to assume its vital role in that sisterlycountry. In the framework of the League of ArabStates  we will continue to support internationalefforts to demonstrate the solidarity of the Arabworld with the Iraqi people as our contribution toestablishing security and stability in that countryand creating conditions conducive to itsreconstruction.7“The Arab countries also support the effortsmade at the United Nations and regional levels and in particular by the African Union  to achieveunity  peace and development in the brotherlySudan. They also welcome the steps taken by theSudanese Government to honour its commitmentsunder the agreement to re-establish security andstability in Darfur  signed on 3 July 2004 with theSecretary-General of the United Nations.“The Arab Summit was an historic occasionat which the Arab States reaffirmed the fact thatfinding just solutions to the fundamentalproblems of the region that have adverselyaffected world peace and security would reinforcethe instincts of its peoples for security and peace enhance the development process  update andconsolidate the principles of human rights anddemocracy  and promote the role and status ofwomen in society  in conformity with eachcountry’s cultural specificities  conditions andabilities  and based on its own free will andcommitment to shared humanitarian values.“Given the Arab States’ conviction of theimportance of the economic and socialdimensions in strengthening the process ofbuilding the pan-Arab system  our Arab Summithas decided to establish a common strategy foreconomic and social action and a plan to fightpoverty and reinforce development efforts. In sodoing  it has demonstrated its resolve tocontribute to implementing the decisions of theMillennium Summit. The Arab States’ call for thearticulation of a new concept of cooperation- andsolidarity-based partnership with all countries ofthe world consecrates the path of dialogue amongcultures and anchors the values of tolerance understanding and complementarity among them.“Our States and peoples hope that theinternational community and the influentialparties will step up their endeavours to settle thepending issues in the region  support the effortsof countries to upgrade their economies  andpromote their development and socialprogrammes in the framework of cooperation andcoordination between the United Nations and theLeague of Arab States.“Tunisia is eager to contribute to thepromotion of joint Arab action and seeks to givenew impetus to regional cooperation. In thatcontext  we and our brother leaders of theMaghreb States are seeking to reactivate theMaghreb Union  which is an irreversible strategicchoice and a legitimate aspiration  shared by allthe peoples of the region  to greatercomplementarity and solidarity. Our country isalso eager to continue contributing to building thestructures of the African Union  strengthening thefoundations of security and stability in Africa and establishing economic and social cooperationamong African countries. That will effectivelyhelp our countries to achieve integration in themarch towards prosperity and progress and tocreate genuine partnerships with regionalgroupings throughout the world.“At the Mediterranean level  the ‘five plusfive’ summit involving the Maghreb countriesand European countries of the southernMediterranean  held in Tunis in December 2003 has made a fresh start for cooperation andsolidarity-based partnership among them in thecontext of establishing security and stability andof achieving economic complementarity  culturaland social communication  and constructivepolitical dialogue. Serving as coordinator of thecommunity of Arab States within the Euro-Mediterranean process  Tunisia strives to injectmore efficiency and vitality into the process so asto consolidate the foundations of security stability and development within the Euro-Mediterranean area.“The World Solidarity Fund for povertyeradication  created on the basis of a Tunisianproposal of 1999 and adopted by the GeneralAssembly on 20 December 2002  reflectsTunisia’s ongoing commitment to anchoring theprinciples of justice  solidarity and sustainabledevelopment in the world  based on oursuccessful pioneering national experience in thatfield over many years. We believe that the Fund which has become a United Nations mechanism requires all members of the internationalcommunity  including Governments  civil societyand private sectors  to pool their efforts andswiftly mobilize the financial resources necessaryto activate it.“In that context  we suggest theproclamation of 20 December of each year as the8world day for the fight against poverty  incommemoration of the date of the GeneralAssembly’s adoption of the resolutionestablishing the Fund and in order to enshrine theconcept of solidarity as a permanent universalvalue in international relations. We also welcomeany initiative in support of the activation of theFund. In that regard  we take special note of theinitiative of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvaof the Federal Republic of Brazil.“Tunisia’s sustained efforts to provideoptimum conditions for the hosting of the secondphase of the World Summit on the InformationSociety on 16 to 18 November 2005 are alsobeing undertaken in that context. We called forthe convening of such a summit in 1998  based onour conviction that  today more than ever before our world needs to establish a solidarity-baseddigital partnership  allowing all countries to beintegrated into the international informationsociety. In that way  we hope to achieve a morejust and balanced approach as a strongdevelopment and cultural bridge between thecountries of the world  in fulfilment of the goalsand principles of the Millennium Summit.“I should like to take this opportunity toreiterate my earlier invitation to heads of Stateand Government  to representatives of civilsociety and the private sector and to otherinternational organizations  extended at the firstphase of the World Summit on the InformationSociety held in Geneva in December 2003  toparticipate actively in the Tunis Summit in orderto ensure its success and to achieve the prosperityand well-being of all humankind.“The General Assembly’s adoption of theTunisian proposal to proclaim 2005 theInternational Year of Sport and PhysicalEducation was a recognition of the importance ofthose two activities in strengthening the bonds offriendship  cooperation and rapprochementamong peoples and in further disseminating peaceand development throughout the world. We areconvinced that all countries recognize the nobledimensions of the proclamation and will spare noeffort to formalize it within their nationalprogrammers next year.“The increasing danger of the phenomenonof terrorism in our times requires greaterinternational coordination in resisting thatscourge and averting its threats by treating itsroot causes  finding just solutions to severaloutstanding international problems  and curbingpoverty  exclusion and marginalization in theworld. Tunisia is convinced that internationalrelations can prosper and develop only in aclimate of dialogue  entente and solidarity eschewing fanaticism  extremism and the dangersof discord and warfare and in a context of justice mutual respect and equitable cooperation amongindividuals  groups and peoples. Thus  security peace and stability may prevail throughout theworld and humankind may look to the future withthe utmost confidence  optimism and ambition.”"
"174",7009,"TUR",59,2004,"I would like to start bycongratulating you  Sir  on your election as Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Ipledge the full support of my delegation for yourendeavours. I would also like to pay tribute to yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte for hisable presidency.We are world leaders at a time when our globe isundergoing an important phase of adaptation to newrealities  opportunities and challenges.As the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. KofiAnnan  frequently states  we now possess the know-how to address our common concerns. The MillenniumSummit  which was the largest gathering of worldleaders  produced a historical document - theMillennium Declaration - which charts the rightcourse for humanity in the new millennium.The goals that the Millennium Declarationdefined for humanity are ambitious  yet achievable.Reducing hunger and extreme poverty  spreadinguniversal primary education  halting infectious diseasesand reducing child mortality within 15 years continueto be urgent tasks.Universal humanitarian challenges and chronicpolitical-military conflicts are compounded with newand asymmetrical threats such as terrorism  narcoticdrugs  organized crime  the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction and environmental problems.On the other hand  racism  anti-Semitism prejudicial attitudes against the tenets of certain creedsand cultures  among them those of Islam  and xenophobiaadd fuel to those menaces. In addition  the special andurgent needs of the African continent continue torequire a collective response.The United Nations system should be encouraged tointensify its role in addressing those issues. Confidence inthe international order and in international institutionsshould not be undermined. A more effective and credibleUnited Nations would be better able to face thecommon challenges of today. The Security Councilshould have a more representative and balancedcharacter; indeed  representation in the Council mustbe inclusive and fair. That will increase its legitimacy25and efficiency. In that respect  I would like tocommend the efforts of the Secretary-General.The correlation between good governance andpeace and prosperity is valid both domestically andinternationally. Therefore  a global agenda for reformshould cover all aspects of domestic and internationallife. Each member of the international community hasa stake in  and responsibility for  the implementation ofsuch an agenda.On our part  my Government  fully conscious ofthat correlation  has carried out sweeping political andeconomic reforms in the past two years. We have thusupgraded and deepened our democracy andconsolidated an accountable  transparent and efficientadministration and a dynamic civil society upholdingthe rule of law and human rights. The expectations ofour people  as well as the relevant United Nations andEuropean Union standards  inspired us in our reformdrive. I take pride in the fact that many observers  bothin the west and in the east  have seen in our experiencethe perfect embodiment of modernity  progress identity and tradition.I should like to take this opportunity to confirmTurkey's candidacy for a non-permanent seat in theSecurity Council for the term 2009-2010. In spite of itssubstantial contributions to peace and security  Turkeyhas not been a member of the Council for almost half acentury. Therefore we rightfully expect the support ofthe General Assembly for our candidacy.Our bid for a non-permanent seat is in tune withTurkey's larger efforts to secure peace  stability andsecurity in its region and beyond. Turkey figuresprominently in humanitarian activities  from Palestine toDarfur. We have been contributing increasing numbers tointernational peacekeeping missions whose geographicaldistribution ranges from Bosnia to Afghanistan.Turkey has a unique position as the only memberof the Organization of the Islamic Conference that isalso a candidate for membership in the EuropeanUnion. That position enables us to facilitate interactionand dialogue between the Islamic world and the West.Turkey has numerous achievements to its creditin the process of helping to create an environmentconducive to development  stability and progress in ourregion and beyond. The Black Sea EconomicCooperation  the Economic Cooperation Organizationand the Stability Pact are good examples to that effect.My Government has been taking a peaceful andproblem-solving approach to world affairs. On thechronic issue of Cyprus  my Government fullysupported Secretary-General Kofi Annanís good-offices mission  and we cooperated closely with him.The Secretary-Generalís settlement plan was the resultof four years of serious negotiations between the twosides. They were conducted on the basis of a newbi-zonal partnership with a federal Government andtwo constituent States. The plan was put to separatereferendums  with the prior agreement of all partiesconcerned. The Annan plan was overwhelminglyaccepted by the Turkish Cypriots  but the GreekCypriot leadership chose to reject it.I profoundly regret the fact that an opportunity toresolve the longstanding problem of Cyprus was thusmissed. As a result  a chance to grant fresh credibilityto the United Nations was lost. A possible source ofinspiration for peacemakers elsewhere  in the MiddleEast or the Caucasus  also disappeared.The Secretary-General  in his report to theSecurity Council  clearly stated that the referendumsdrastically changed the situation on the island. Itconfirmed  once again  the existence of two equal peoplesand their separate rights to decide their own fate.The Secretary-General also called on themembers of the Security Council to'give a strong lead to all States to cooperate bothbilaterally and in international bodies  toeliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriersthat have the effect of isolating the TurkishCypriots and impeding their development'(S/2004/437  p. 2).Turkey remains committed to a lasting settlementin Cyprus. Five months have passed since the TurkishCypriots  responding to the call of the internationalcommunity  voted courageously in favour of the UnitedNations plan. However  they have yet to be rewardedfor expressing their will to reunify the island. We urgethe Security Council positively to respond to theSecretary-Generalís call. We also appeal to UnitedNations Member States to take concrete steps  at thebilateral level  to put an end to the isolation andpunishment of the people of the Turkish Republic ofNorthern Cyprus.26Turkey has been strongly supporting  and willcontinue to support  the preservation of peace andstability in south-east Europe.We are glad to note that considerable progress hasbeen achieved in this region thanks to the sustainedefforts of the international community and of theBalkan countries themselves.Turkey is determined to sustain the promising andconstructive atmosphere in our relations with Greece.We hope that the improvement in bilateral relationswill continue in the coming period. Our wide-rangingcooperation is expanding in every field. That willfacilitate the settlement of all pending issues. It willalso result in a climate of cooperation beneficial to thetwo countries  as well as peace  stability and security inthe region as a whole.Turkey believes that it is high time to start takingconcrete steps towards eliminating the existingìfrozenî conflicts in the southern Caucasus  such asthose in Nagorno-Karabakh  Abkhazia and SouthOssetia. As a neighbouring country  we are activelycontributing to efforts aimed at achieving stability andprosperity in that region. To that end  we have beenencouraging all the parties concerned while facilitatingthe ongoing process of dialogue. We hope that theAbkhazian conflict and the problems in South Ossetiawill be overcome by peaceful means  within theframework of the territorial integrity and sovereigntyof Georgia.My Government supports a just and lastingsolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on the basisof the fundamental principles of international law  theterritorial integrity of Azerbaijan and good-neighbourlyrelations. We expect the Armenian Government to fullycomply with the relevant United Nations resolutions toreach such a solution.The Middle East problem and the situation in Iraqand Afghanistan are the major conflicts responsible forcompounding instability in the world and are leading toincreasingly serious consequences.The road map is the only available framework fora comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Palestinianproblem. Benefiting from its traditional ties with theparties  Turkey has already offered its activecontribution to the implementation of the road map. Wealso support every effort that is initiated andcoordinated in that context.We join the call made by the Quartet yesterday.The resumption of the negotiating process between thetwo parties should remain the central objective ofcurrent efforts. It is important  likewise  that both sidesfulfil their performance criteria as laid out in the roadmap. Terrorist attacks against the Israeli people muststop. So must the deliberate destruction of Palestinianlives and properties. The process of the reform ofPalestinian institutions must be advanced. Israelisettlement activities must be immediately halted. Theruling of the International Court of Justice must berespected. And the living conditions of the Palestiniansneed to be urgently improved.Any settlement would be incomplete withoutprogress on all tracks  including those involving Syriaand Lebanon.My Government is focused on contributing to theimprovement of the situation in Iraq. We appreciate themassive resources and political efforts mobilized bythe United States Administration and the internationalcommunity for the rehabilitation and reconstruction ofIraq. We sincerely hope those efforts yield the desiredresults soon. However  the humanitarian  political andsecurity difficulties faced by the people of Iraqcontinue to adversely affect one another. It goeswithout saying that developments in Iraq are alsoaffecting my country and causing suffering for mypeople  while  as we are a neighbouring country  mostof Iraqís humanitarian needs are being suppliedthrough Turkey.The Iraqi transition is not only about the fate ofthe Iraqi nation. It is about the future of peace andprosperity in the whole region and beyond. That is themotive for Turkey's strong support of a united territorially intact and democratic Iraq - an Iraq that is atpeace with itself and with its neighbours. That shouldand can only be achieved with the full participation andsupport of the Iraqi people as a whole. More UnitedNations involvement would facilitate that task. Theseries of neighbouring countries meetings  initiated byTurkey  is also a valuable instrument to be taken intoaccount. After all  as Iraqís success will be ourcollective success  so its failure will also be acollective failure. For its part  Turkey will continue tosupport the Iraqi interim Governmentís efforts inpaving the way to normalcy and democracy.Turkey's traditional support for the Afghanpeople will continue. The establishment of security 27stability and a democratic system in Afghanistan isanother urgent task. Freeing that country fromterrorism  extremism and narcotics is of crucialimportance for the international community. We shouldall work to make the upcoming elections a significantstep towards those ends.We all agree that terrorism has no justification. Itcan never claim to respect any religion  nation orcause. Indiscriminate killing of innocent people  be itin New York  Istanbul  Baghdad  Beslan or elsewhere is a crime against humanity. We condemn thoseterrorist atrocities in the strongest terms.As a country that has long suffered fromterrorism  Turkey calls for more intensified multilateralcooperation. The United Nations system is animportant platform in that respect and we extend ourfull support to efforts under its aegis.We also strongly believe in the urgent need tostrengthen the control regimes for weapons of massdestruction and their delivery systems. We willcontinue to support ongoing work to ensure fulladherence to the legal instruments in that field. Thecreation of nuclear-weapon-free zones is an importantway of strengthening peace and security in the worldand in all regions  including the Middle East.Turkey is determined to use every effort anddeploy all the means at its disposal in order tostrengthen peace and stability in its immediate regionand beyond. We will try to use the influence of ourmultidimensional ties and deep-rooted relations toachieve that goal. We remain strongly committed totranslating into reality the universal validity of thenoble values and principles enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter."
"175",7025,"TUV",59,2004,"I have the greatest honour tospeak on behalf of the people of Tuvalu  who wish mefirst of all to convey their warmest greetings to thissession of the General Assembly. We also extend oursincere congratulations to you  Mr. President  on yourelection and assure you of our full cooperation.18We congratulate the outgoing President  Mr.Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia  for his excellentleadership. Coming from a small island developing Stateourselves  we are proud of the many achievements soably accomplished under his presidency.We would also like to extend our warmestgratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan and his staff for their dedication to the work of theUnited Nations. The United Nations  through theSecretary-General’s High Representative  participatedin the Pacific Island Forum Leaders meeting  held inSamoa last month  at which a new strategy for regionalcooperation in the Pacific  the Pacific Plan  wasconsidered.That is highly commendable. Like all Forummembers  Tuvalu looks forward to United Nationssolidarity and support  bilaterally and through thePacific Island Forum and other Pacific regionalorganizations  in order to realize that Pacific initiative.Tuvalu is privileged and proud to be in this mostindispensable body  the United Nations. Our presencehere demonstrates our belief in the noble principles andgoals of the United Nations. At the same time however  we are constantly reminded of ourresponsibilities to all Tuvaluans  who every day worryabout their future economic  cultural  environmentaland long-term security and survival on our small isolated and extremely vulnerable islands.Tuvuluans wonder if the pride of being in theUnited Nations is commensurate with the many aspiredneeds of our people. Is there any real value of being atthe United Nations to the villagers and localcommunities  who can barely overcome the limitationsposed by the lack of opportunities  marginalization isolation  economic exclusion and their extremevulnerability?It is our strong belief that to maintain itslegitimacy and relevance to all  the United Nationsneeds to reassess its role and functions in order tobetter reflect the reality of today’s world  in line withits principle of sovereign  equitable participation andrepresentation. We therefore support ongoing reformsin the work of the United Nations. In particular  wesupport the increase in the number of both permanentand non-permanent seats in the Security Council.Expansion  in our view  should be considered on thebasis of responsible contribution to internationaldevelopment and peace  and in this vein we wouldsupport the allocation of a permanent seat to Japan. Wealso believe more equitable representation of thedeveloping countries in the non-permanent seats of theCouncil is vital and long overdue.Security challenges continue to create worldwidehavoc  fear and uncertainty. Terrorist acts  includingthe unfortunate seizure of a school in Russia  haveproven the continued existence of forces bent onundermining the United Nations founding goals offreedom  peace and security. They have alsounderscored the urgency with which we  the UnitedNations  must collectively combat these forces.Tuvalu is fully committed to joining the fightagainst international terrorism as required by SecurityCouncil resolutions. But we would need to seek theassistance of the United Nations and the internationalcommunity to help us fulfil those requirements particularly the reporting requirements of thoseresolutions and of the international anti-terrorismconventions.Tuvalu recognizes the seriousness of theHIV/AIDS epidemic in relation to the social andeconomic development and security of Tuvalu andother Pacific island countries. Given our exposure andthe level of mobility of our communities  particularlyour seafarers who serve on merchant ships worldwide there is an urgent need for assistance from theinternational community  such as that provided underthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis andMalaria  in order to combat the threats of the epidemic.As is widely acknowledged  a serious challengeto Tuvalu and to all small island developing States is ourunique vulnerability to external forces. That vulnerabilityarises not from our own actions but simply from ourbeing islands with small economies  our isolation  ourfragmentation and the fragility of our naturalenvironments. These factors taken together translate intosignificant constraints on development and a severe lackof capacity to cope with the many changes taking placein the world  especially through globalization.Yet for us in small island developing States although we witness daily the forces of trade communications and travel creating a single globalcommunity  the problems associated with poverty  lackof opportunity  marginalization and environmentaldecline continue to plague our efforts. There is agenuine need for the United Nations and theinternational community to better recognize the special19and unique circumstances of small island developingStates and their aspirations to participate moreequitably in a globalized world.Sustainable development  particularly for themost disadvantaged and vulnerable developing States is most crucial. In June  Tuvalu undertook acomprehensive review of its development priorities andadopted a national sustainable development strategythat we call “The Tuvalu Vision 2015”  premised oninternational development agendas  including thereview of the Barbados Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  and aimed at building Tuvalu’s resilience incoping with the challenges it faces.The promotion of good governance  democraticprinciples and respect for the rule of law is stronglyrecognized as fundamental to the successfulimplementation of that strategy. We acknowledge withgreatest appreciation the generous support of theGovernments of Australia  New Zealand  Ireland  theUnited Kingdom  Italy and the Republic of China onTaiwan  the United Nations Department of Economicand Social Affairs and the Asian Development Bank inthat exercise. We look forward to partnering with them and with others in the international community  in therealization of that strategy.As a poorly resourced small island developingState and a least developed country as well  even our bestefforts to escape the cycle of poverty and marginalizationare doomed to failure without the meaningful support ofthe international community  civil society and theprivate sector. The Millennium Declaration  theMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan ofImplementation have all provided clear road maps forpartnerships towards sustainable development. Thesignposts offered under these road maps will remainmere rhetoric unless they translate into realdevelopments  responsive to the unique needs of smallisland developing States such as Tuvalu.It is for these reasons that full and effectiveimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Actionfor the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States is ever so crucial. Tuvalu is veryencouraged by the progress so far achieved in thereview of the Programme.However  success in the further implementationof the Barbados Programme of Action will dependentirely on a better appreciation of the unique situationof small island developing States such as Tuvalu  easieraccess to and the provision of adequate financial andtechnical resources  development aid and thedissemination of appropriate technology  particularlyfor new and renewable energy and capacity-building.In terms of natural resources  Tuvalu is truly asmall island country in a big ocean. The Pacific Oceansurrounding our islands provides the vital source of ourlivelihoods and our economic and social development.Increasingly  however  we are concerned with the realthreats of illegal  unreported and unregulated fishingand of ocean pollution from waste  particularly from thetrans-shipment of highly radioactive and toxic materialsthrough our region. We seek the understanding of theinternational community to help us save our oceans andsupport fully the Pacific Islands Regional Ocean Policyadopted by our Government leaders in 2002.The overall decline in overseas developmentassistance in real terms is cause for serious concern.The failure of developed countries to fulfil the UnitedNations minimum target of providing 0.7 per cent oftheir gross national product in overseas developmentassistance to small island developing States translates intolower economic growth as well as a further wideningdevelopment gap for small island developing Statessuch as Tuvalu. This needs to be addressed urgently.An important source of financial flows todeveloping countries  particularly to small islanddeveloping States such as Tuvalu  is migrant workers’remittances from developed countries. Indeed remittances from our overseas workers  andparticularly Tuvaluan seafarers serving abroad  providea substantial source of income  which is so vital forsocial and economic development in Tuvalu. Tuvalufully supports giving urgent international attention tothe issue of migrant workers’ rights  including themaintenance of international standards specifyingminimum requirements for certificates of competencyand provisions for the safety and security of migrantworkers  in order to ensure the continuation of thisvital source of capital for SIDS.The international meeting in Mauritius in Januarymust result in a stronger commitment from theinternational community and in pragmatic and doableactions on the ground in all small island developingStates.An issue of continuing concern to Tuvalu is thequestion of the representation of the Republic of China20on Taiwan in the United Nations. Regrettably  thisOrganization cannot be said to be universal without therightful representation of the 23 million people of theRepublic of China on Taiwan. Tuvalu feels that theactive and responsible participation of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan in world affairs — especially in trade commerce and international development — withoutrepresentation in the United Nations is unjust andmorally wrong and needs to be corrected.We in Tuvalu  a mere three meters above sealevel  live in constant fear of the adverse impact ofclimate change and the rising sea level. Our livelihoodsand sources of food security are already badly affected.With increased ground water salinity  land erosion andcoral bleaching  we experience total anxiety. The threatis real and serious and is like a slow and insidious formof terrorism against Tuvalu.Tuvalu  therefore  accords significant importanceto the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change and its Kyoto Protocol  as theyprovide the most appropriate global framework toreducing greenhouse gas emissions. We congratulatethe Framework Convention secretariat as theConvention marks its tenth anniversary this year.However  we are deeply concerned by the failure andthe lack of leadership on the part of industrializedcountries in the implementation of commitments and inthe ratification and enforcing of the Kyoto Protocol.We in small island developing States recognizethat all nations must take steps to mitigate greenhousegas emissions at some stage. However  Tuvalu believesthat the Kyoto Protocol must be the first step in thisdirection for now and for setting the way forward inthe future. The Protocol as such must enter into forcewithout delay. However  the industrialized countriesmust act first as it is their legacy of emissions that iscreating the problems of today. Actions must alsoinclude assisting small island developing States in theiradaptation to the adverse effects of climate change particularly in terms of urgently providing adequatefinancial and technical resources in line with theresponsibilities and obligations under the FrameworkConvention.As we mark the tenth anniversary of theFramework Convention  and as we begin to explorefuture actions against climate change and sea-levelrise  we appeal for more attention from the UnitedNations  whose raison d’être is to ensure world peaceand security  and for stronger leadership by theinternational community against this global threat.In conclusion  we want to say that efforts aimedat the sustainable development of small island Stateslike Tuvalu will have no meaning unless the issue ofclimate change and sea level is addressed decisivelyand with urgency. Tuvalu’s interest in enforcing Kyotois not self-serving. The more serious consequences ofnot acting now  as we are already witnessing the worldover  will be felt everywhere.It is our hope that  out of this common house ofour United Nations family  there will emerge betterunderstanding and goodwill for the long-lastingsecurity and survival of Tuvalu  of SIDS and of thewhole world.God bless the United Nations."
"176",7071,"TZA",59,2004,"I congratulate you  Sir  onyour election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. I assure you ofTanzania’s support as you discharge your mandate. Ipay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Julian Hunte  forhis able stewardship of the work of the GeneralAssembly. I commend the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  and his staff for their dedicated service andtireless efforts during a very difficult time.The Millennium Development Goals representour vision and hope for a new global partnership forshared global prosperity and security — an ideal at thevery heart of the United Nations. But we are still faroff the mark in meeting many of them  especially insub-Saharan Africa. We must further strengthen ourcommon resolve to act in their resolute pursuit. In this as in other things  actions speak louder than words.We commend Denmark  Luxembourg  theNetherlands  Norway and Sweden for consistentlymeeting the long-established United Nations target ofallocating at least 0.7 per cent of the national incomesof rich countries to development cooperation. Thosecountries have a broad national consensus on thatmatter  and their people are not in any way poorerbecause of it. We urge the other rich countries toproduce timetables to meet that long-overdue target  tohave coherent development policies and to earnestlyand deliberately build and nurture a nationalconsciousness and consensus on the global war onpoverty. That war should now be a central politicalissue for all countries  rich and poor. Only then will thepolitical will be generated to do more for the timelyattainment of the Millennium Development Goals.It is true that money is not a panacea  but theeighth Millennium Development Goal — to develop aglobal partnership for development — may actually bethe single most important key to unlocking newinitiatives and latent capabilities to enable us to attainthe Goals. And a genuine partnership implies sharedrights and responsibilities as well as a shared19commitment to be evaluated. I commend theGovernments of the Netherlands and Denmark forconducting  and making public  evaluations of theirperformance in meeting their commitments under theeighth Millennium Development Goal.On our part  never before have so many AfricanGovernments committed themselves to gooddemocratic governance  to peer review  to ownership ofthe development agenda and to the participatoryprioritization and sequencing of the tasks necessaryfor the attainment of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. We now need an equally unprecedentedcommitment — in deeds — to the global war onpoverty in all rich countries. African countries doingtheir part in the global compact on poverty alleviationshould not be constrained by a lack of supportiveexternal resources. At the International Conference onFinancing for Development  held at Monterrey developed countries pledged to match stronger reformefforts in developing countries with increased support.Tanzania asks that they now show leadership bydelivering on their promises.When both rich and poor countries meet theirobligations  tangible progress is realized. My countryis an example. Our Primary Education DevelopmentProgramme  for instance  has recorded remarkableprogress. We now expect to attain the educationMillennium Development Goal in 2006  nine yearsahead of schedule. Gender parity has been attained  andthe net enrolment ratio is already 90.1 per cent. Passrates have doubled over the past four years. That wasmade possible by an increased budgetary allocation tothe sector  by debt relief  by increased aid channelledthrough our own budget and by local ownership andparticipation. We are grateful for the cooperation wehave received from our development partners.Together  we have shown what can be done where thereis political will.Yesterday  my colleagues and I launched thereport of the World Commission on the SocialDimension of Globalization  entitled “A fairglobalization: Creating opportunities for all”. Thereport is a contribution by commissioners with variedbackgrounds and experiences; it is also a reflection ofthe views of many ordinary people consulted throughnational and regional dialogues. It presents oneimportant consensus: globalization has produced bothstriking achievements and harmful distortions in globalgrowth and development. We all agreed that  leftunchecked  globalization will exacerbate the wealthgap within and between nations  thereby planting theseeds of social instability and crime on a national andglobal scale. But the report also presents the prospectof hope. Globalization  when properly governed  canbe a force for good — a catalyst for change and formeeting the Millennium Development Goals. Icommend the report to the Assembly.Responses to the challenges of globalization mustbegin at home. Good governance  prudent monetaryand fiscal policies  macroeconomic stability  peace andsecurity  the protection of property rights  settingpriorities for poverty reduction and the creation of aconducive environment for investment and trade  bothbetween Africans themselves and between Africa andthe rest of the world — all those are things that we inAfrica have agreed to address.But I must stress one conditionality: no solutionsto Africa’s problems can be sustainable unless they aregenuinely embraced and owned by Africansthemselves. We have shown our new resolve to cometo terms with our problems and to take the initiativeand the lead in finding solutions. From ourdevelopment partners  we ask in return for genuinerespect for our ownership and the policy space for localinitiative and leadership. We need policy space to dealwith problems such as conflict  ethnicity  land andagrarian reform and institution-building  and we needadequate  consistent and predictable external support toimplement the solutions we put forward.The Democratic Republic of the Congo deservesour continued and strong support. Instability in thatcountry robs the entire region of its potential for sharedprogress  development and solidarity. The people of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo must continue towalk down the path of peace  reconciliation and unity.They and the Government of President Kabila need anddeserve our robust help. We commend President Mbekiand the South African Government for their efforts and Tanzania pledges its unwavering support to them.In Burundi  we commend President Museveni ofUganda and the South African Vice-President Mr. Jacob Zuma  for their dedication to helpingBurundi realize a new political and social dispensationof inclusive governance  development and peace. TheRegional Initiative for Peace in Burundi has madestrenuous efforts to accommodate  throughnegotiations  all the parties in a Government of20national unity. Sadly  the Parti pour la libération dupeuple hutu-Forces nationales de libération(Palipehutu-FNL) has refused to be part of thatprocess. Its declaration of responsibility for themassacres against innocent and unarmed refugees atGatumba was the proverbial last straw for us in theregion  so we took a stand and declared the FNL aterrorist group. We appeal for the Assembly’s supportin treating it as such.The first international conference on the GreatLakes region  which Tanzania will host in November2004  will review aspects concerning peace andsecurity  governance and democracy  economicdevelopment and regional integration  as well ashumanitarian and social issues in the region.Ultimately  we hope to adopt a comprehensive security stability and development pact for the Great Lakesregion. I thank the Group of Friends of the Great Lakesregion for supporting the preparatory process andappeal to the United Nations and the internationalcommunity to render their support to that process.The humanitarian tragedy in Darfur is harrowingand demands urgent remedy. A humanitarian ceasefireagreement must be promulgated  presaging theevolution of a democratic and political culture. Wecommend and support the effort by His ExcellencyOlusegun Obasanjo  President of Nigeria and AfricanUnion Chair  and President Idriss Deby of Chad. Weask for the practical  urgent and increased support ofthe United Nations and the international community asa whole for the initiatives of the African Union inaddressing this tragedy.The question of Western Sahara has dragged onfor too long. We fully support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. It is theduty of this body to help them realize it. We supportthe United Nations peace plan and call on all sides tocooperate fully in its speedy implementation.When the Middle East road map was put forwardin 2003  we supported it  believing that it addressedcomprehensively the issue of the establishment of aviable Palestinian State living with the State of Israel with recognized and secure borders between them. It isregrettable that the road map has been put aside. In ourview  the road map remains the most reasonable  viableand sustainable way of resolving this long-standingconflict. We condemn the cycle of violence andkillings and the use of excessive force. We urge thatthe implementation of the road map be brought back ontrack.We are living with the spectre of internationalterrorism: the most vicious and pernicious amonginternational crimes. The people of Tanzania will neverforget the terrorist attack directed at the AmericanEmbassy in Dar es Salaam in 1998  which killed orwounded innocent Tanzanians. There should never beany doubt about our unflinching resolve to cooperatewith others in combating terrorism in all its forms.Tanzania is a faithful and active Member of theUnited Nations  and we reaffirm our readiness to workwith our fellow Members in addressing global concernsin furtherance of the ideals of the Assembly and theCharter of the United Nations. It is  therefore  withdeep humility and gratitude that the United Republic ofTanzania has secured the endorsement of the AfricanUnion to seek a non-permanent seat in the SecurityCouncil. Our candidature will be placed before theAssembly for election later during this session  and weappeal for the full support of our candidature.The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to ravagemany of our countries. As public awareness grows andtechnology improves  so do our chances of protectingthe most basic human right  the right to life. That rightcan be enjoyed by our people if current and futureadvances in science and technology are extended to themany poor who are infected with HIV/AIDS.Preventive care  access to affordable drugs and thehealth delivery infrastructure in developing countriesall need to be widened and strengthened. On this front too  we need help.Democratic governance is a universal norm which has to be reflected also in the United Nationssystem. What is desirable for our individual countriesmust also be true for the United Nations. Recentdevelopments in the reform agenda of the Organizationmust therefore be expedited. Our hope is that the reportof the High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges andChange will bring forth recommendations for a firmjump forward in the reconfiguration of the reformprocess.The Security Council must be representative oftoday’s wider membership of the United Nations andreflective of the current geopolitical and economicstructure of the world. There are countries in Asia Africa and Latin America that deserve permanent seatsbecause of their major contribution to the sustainability21of the Organization and to global peace  security anddevelopment. The time to bring them in has come.Members of the United Nations must upholdsteadfastly  in word and deed  the ideals of its Charterfor peace with justice and for security withdevelopment for all. These common aspirations are thefoundation of international law  of international orderand of international cooperation. They also invest withcredible legitimacy our collective pursuit of thehappiness of humanity and the renewal of humanity’senvironment. Working together  we can ascend to theheights to which we aspire. Only then shall we leave tocoming generations a deserved legacy of a commonfuture for all mankind."
"177",7114,"UGA",59,2004,"On behalf of mydelegation  the people of Uganda  and on my ownbehalf  I would like to congratulate you  Mr. Jean Ping from the sister African Republic of Gabon  upon yourelection to preside over the General Assembly at itsfifty-ninth session. I have every confidence in yourstewardship in steering the session to a successfulconclusion.I thank the Secretary-General for his excellentleadership  especially during these trying times for theUnited Nations. I note with satisfaction that  after ayear in which the centrality of the United Nations inthe maintenance of international peace and security hascome under serious challenge  there seems to be areturn to the more widely accepted multilateralapproach to resolving global challenges.Terrorism continues to be one of the biggestthreats to international peace and security. Since11 September 2001  thousands of innocent people including women and children  have been killed ormaimed as a result of indiscriminate terrorist acts. Thisyear  the world has witnessed many innocent civiliansmassacred in cold blood  hostages beheaded in themost barbaric manner  children mutilated by suicidebombers and terrorist groups  very often in the name ofextremist and misguided causes and ideologies.Whether it is the recent appalling attack on schoolchildren in the Russian town of Beslan  or the massacreof civilians in Balonyo in northern Uganda  theintention of terrorists is the same: to undermine anddivide our societies  overthrow elected Governments and to strike at the heart of international peace andstability.The Uganda delegation condemns those terroristacts in the strongest terms. We do not accept that anycause  however genuine  warrants the indiscriminatedestruction of human life or property.In Uganda  we have been fighting against aterrorist organization known as the Lord’s ResistanceArmy  based in southern Sudan. That organization haskilled  maimed and abducted tens of thousands ofUgandan children in the northern part of Uganda. Theacts of plunder and destruction by those criminals havelaid to waste entire villages and driven helplessvillagers into camps for internally displaced persons.The Government of Uganda is sparing no effort  withthe cooperation of the Government of Sudan  to endthat situation and restore peace and stability in thisarea. We are confident that soon the remnants of thoseterrorists will have been eliminated or captured.Despite amnesty legislation and a standing offer ofpardon by our President  very few have responded.However  recently some improvement in reporting hasbeen observed.Uganda welcomes the recent restoration ofsovereignty to the Iraqi people. We call upon theUnited Nations  in particular  and the internationalcommunity as a whole  to do everything possible toassist the interim Government in the rehabilitation ofIraq and re-establishment of the physical and politicalinfrastructure to allow the holding of scheduledelections in that country.The conflict between Israel and Palestine  oftendriven by rigid positions  continues to pose a seriousthreat to peace and stability in the Middle East. Ugandasupports the Quartet-led road map for a comprehensivepeaceful settlement in the Middle East. We support theestablishment of a Palestinian State existing side-by-side and in peace with Israel within secure andrecognized borders  in accordance with relevant UnitedNations Security Council resolutions.After more than 50 years of violence andbloodshed  both the Israelis and Palestinians mustrethink their positions. New  creative approaches to acomprehensive peace should therefore be sought forthe sake of their peoples. Every year we adoptresolutions which remain mere paper. Resolutions arenot solutions in themselves; it is high time we engagedconstructively in the serious search for a solution  forthe future of humanity and the Middle East.Turning to the Great Lakes region  we note withsatisfaction the positive developments with regard tothe peace processes in various conflict situations. In31Burundi  the transitional Government has beenconsolidated with almost all the fighting groupssubscribing to the Arusha Peace and ReconciliationAgreement for Burundi. We call upon the groups stillremaining outside the peace settlement to cease theirmilitary operations and join the peace process. Wecongratulate the African peace mission for itscontribution to the peace process and we welcome thedeployment of United Nations peacekeepers toBurundi. Election dates may change  but the electionsmust be held sooner or later. Elections  a newGovernment and good proposals relating to thequestion of representation — all must work for peacefor Burundi. It is therefore important that theinternational community extend the necessaryassistance for the consolidation of peace  stability rehabilitation and development of Burundi.Uganda remains committed to supporting thepeace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo(DRC). We urge all parties in the Government ofNational Unity in Kinshasa to remain committed to thePretoria Peace Agreement and to resist any temptationto resume hostilities. We also call upon the SecurityCouncil to strengthen the United Nations OrganizationMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo(MONUC) under Chapter VII of the Charter toconsolidate its peacekeeping operations. A robustMONUC force would be critical for the enforcement ofSecurity Council resolution 1493 (2003) on the armsembargo against militias  as well as the disarmament demobilization  rehabilitation  resettlement andreintegration of all armed rebel groups and militiasoperating on the territory of the DRC. That would alsoserve to reduce  and hopefully to eliminate  inter-ethnicclashes in the eastern Democratic Republic of theCongo and help to reassure neighbouring countriesabout cross-border security. It may also be important toinclude other legitimate groups in the Government ofNational Unity and Transition in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo in order to enhance peace. Webelieve that before democratic elections are held it isimportant to create a consensus for peace and security.Uganda believes that as a result of the positiveachievements in the peace processes in Burundi and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo there is an urgentneed to convene the international conference on theGreat Lakes region under the auspices of the UnitedNations and the African Union. The conference  whichis scheduled to take place in Dar es Salaam  UnitedRepublic of Tanzania  in November 2004  will bringtogether a core group of the Great Lakes countries andthe neighbouring countries affected by the conflicts orthose that  by infection  contribute to them.In order to consolidate the peace efforts  we hopethat the Great Lakes regional conference will involveall stakeholders in the development of a strategic planof action on the key issues  including regional peaceand security  development  post-conflict reconstructionand regional integration in the context of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). I amglad to note that countries of the Great Lakes region including Uganda  have already embarked on apreparatory process for the conference involving youthand women’s groups  non-governmental organizationsand local government officials from all border districts.We believe that this inclusive process will ensurenational ownership and commitment to theimplementation of the recommendations of theconference.The delegation of Uganda welcomes the peaceaccords recently signed in Nairobi between theGovernment of Sudan and the Sudan People’sLiberation Movement and Liberation Army (SPLM/A).We hope that those accords will lead to the end of thelong-running conflict  which has caused untoldsuffering to the people of the southern Sudan and led toinsecurity in neighbouring countries — particularly myown  Uganda. With the return of peace and stability inthe southern Sudan  we are confident that we will beable to bring to an end the Lord’s Resistance Armyattacks against our people in the northern part ofUganda.My country is an active participant in theIntergovernmental Authority on Development initiativethat has brought the various factions in Somaliatogether to the negotiating table to end the conflict inthat country. We note with great satisfaction theprogress that has so far been made  and we salute thepeople of Somalia for coming together to establish aParliament embracing all groups.In 2005 the United Nations will observe the fifthanniversary of the Millennium Summit  where wepledged our political will and commitment to a numberof Millennium Development Goals  including thereduction of poverty by 50 per cent by 2015. It is therefore  of great concern that in many parts of Africapoverty levels are rising as per capita incomes continueto decline and that infant and maternal mortality ratesare on the increase  while official developmentassistance commitments remain unfulfilled.32In order to make progress in meeting theMillennium Development Goals and ensuring theequitable sharing of the benefits of globalization  theGeneral Assembly should focus on the following  interalia: effective follow-up to and implementation of thevarious plans of action  declarations and strategiesrelating to the Monterrey Consensus on financing fordevelopment  the Johannesburg Plan of Implementationon sustainable development  the Brussels Declarationand Programme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries and the Almaty Programme of Action onlandlocked developing countries; restructuring of theglobal trading system  especially in agriculture  mode 4trade in services and increasing value-added exportproducts from the developing countries; mobilizationof adequate resources to fight malaria  tuberculosis andthe HIV/AIDS pandemic  covering prevention  careand research and development to ensure the provisionof cheaper and more effective drugs and possibly thediscovery of an HIV/AIDS vaccine; strengthening ofSouth-South cooperation  including measures by themore advanced developing countries to open theirmarkets to products from the least developed countries;and stronger international support for NEPAD  whichreflects Africa’s priorities to address development governance and the security challenges facing thecontinent. Critical support areas will include marketaccess  measures to encourage increased foreign directinvestment in African countries  higher levels ofofficial development assistance for infrastructure andhuman resources development  ensuring sustainabledebt levels  regional integration  enhancement of theAfrican Union’s capacity to deal with conflictsituations and implementation of the African PeerReview Mechanism.As the United Nations approaches its sixtiethbirthday in 2005  the need for revitalization of theGeneral Assembly and restructuring of the SecurityCouncil has never been greater. The need for reform ofthe United Nations is imperative if we want to enhancethe role of the Organization and the effectiveness ofmultilateralism to address emerging hard threats suchas terrorism  weapons of mass destruction andgenocide  as well as other challenges  such aspersistent poverty and HIV/AIDS. It is therefore fittingthat the report of the High-level Panel on Threats Challenges and Change will be discussed in 2005.With regard to reform of the Security Council the restructuring should reflect the need fordemocratization and ensuring a balanced and equitablegeographical representation. We believe that Africashould be allocated no less than two permanent andfive non-permanent seats in the expanded SecurityCouncil.In summary  Uganda is calling for strongercollective action against international terrorism andsupport for the post-conflict rehabilitation anddevelopment programme in northern Uganda. We havenoted the positive developments in the Great Lakesregion and stressed the importance of convening theinternational conference on the Great Lakes region inDar es Salaam in November 2004. We have highlightedthe significance of 2005 — as the both the sixtiethbirthday of the United Nations and the fifthanniversary of the Millennium Summit — as a keytime to focus on meeting the Millennium DevelopmentGoals and the revitalization and restructuring of theUnited Nations to enhance the role of the Organizationand to ensure the effectiveness of collectivemultilateral action."
"178",7161,"UKR",59,2004,"Mr. President  firstof all I would like to congratulate you on yourassumption of the important post of President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. Let me also21pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Julian Hunte for hishighly professional and fruitful work accomplished atthe helm of the General Assembly.A year ago the Secretary-General stressed in thisHall that the United Nations had reached a fork in theroad. This is still true today. We have a long list ofproblems  but we do not have a clear vision of how todeal with them. To choose the right way  to solve aconflict between wishes and resources  betweendesirable and achievable  we should concentrate onpriorities.Let me outline Ukraine’s vision of the mostimportant issues on which the United Nations shouldfocus. The tragedy in the Russian city of Beslan andother recent terrorist attacks leave no doubt that fightagainst terrorism is truly the major priority. We expressour sympathy to the victims and strongly condemnterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.The underlying reason for terrorism is to createchaos  to disrupt the global system of peace andsecurity established and promoted by our Organization.Thus  we have to act collectively. We have to overcomeold prejudices and to establish a spirit of confidenceand a new culture of international cooperation  whichwould embrace the whole spectrum of political  lawenforcement and security instruments.Creation of a new and efficient system ofinformation exchange on terrorism will help preventnew attacks and save priceless human lives. Wesupport the views expressed by previous speakers onthe need for a broader approach to address the complexand interdependent nature of security. To preventterrorist acts and to eliminate the roots of terrorism  theUnited Nations must promote better understanding  aglobal rapprochement between various civilizationsand religions. There are universal values of peace andsecurity which are a cornerstone of our Organizationand which can serve as a basis for a new atmosphere oftolerance in the world.Ukraine  as a country actively participating in thestabilization forces in Iraq  is concerned by the terroristinsurgency and continuing violence there. Although thesituation in Iraq remains difficult  there are somepositive trends. Ukraine welcomes the transition ofpower to the Iraqi people and the formation of theinterim government. It is important to ensure effectiveimplementation of the timetable for a comprehensivepolitical transition process in the country  particularlythrough the holding of free and fair elections  with thehighest standards possible under the currentcircumstances.Security Council resolution 1546 (2004) clearlyenvisages a central role for the United Nations in acomprehensive political transition in the country and inthe reconstruction process. However  the Iraqi crisisand the international fight against terrorism haverevealed the need to strengthen the United Nations as akey instrument for safeguarding international peaceand security.Institutional reform of the United Nations including the Security Council  which should becometruly representative and balanced  is an important task.We understand the reasons behind the suggestions toenlarge the Council in both its permanent and non-permanent membership  and we are ready to carefullyconsider relevant proposals. In this respect  Ukraineattaches primary importance to the allocation of anadditional non-permanent seat to the Group of EasternEuropean States.But reform must not only involve some structuralchanges. We should not have to embark on reformevery 20 years when a new balance of power emergesin the international arena. Universal criteria and acommon understanding of threats and challenges arenecessary to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency ofour Organization in the twenty-first century.We fully share the view expressed by theSecretary-General at the beginning of the generaldebate that the rule of law should be a priority both athome and in international affairs. We look forward tothe outcome of the deliberations of the High-levelPanel on Threats  Challenges and Change. UnitedNations authority should be increased  particularlythrough its greater involvement in conflict preventionand resolution. As President Leonid Kuchma ofUkraine emphasized  conflict prevention should bepivotal to the philosophy of United Nations work in thenew millennium.In our region  frozen conflicts in Abkhazia  SouthOssetia  Nagorny-Karabakh and Transdnistria need tobe solved as soon as possible.As one of the major contributors to UnitedNations peacekeeping operations and the largest inEurope  Ukraine is deeply concerned by the increasingdanger to the lives of peacekeeping personnel. We22stand for the universal application of the Conventionon the Safety of United Nations and AssociatedPersonnel and call upon all Member States to abidestrictly by its provisions.The role of the United Nations in the field of non-proliferation and disarmament should also bestrengthened. This year Ukraine will mark the tenthanniversary of its accession to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Its landmarkdecision to eliminate the third largest nuclear arsenaland to relinquish nuclear capability has significantlyenhanced the international non-proliferation regimeand global security. We hope that Ukraine’s positiveexample will be followed by other countries that nowentertain the erroneous idea that they can protect theirsecurity through access to nuclear weapons.All achievements by the international communitymay come to naught if our populations succumb toHIV/AIDS. This disease has killed more peopleannually than have all armed conflicts on the planetadded together. We highly appreciate the work carriedout by the United Nations  its specialized agencies andby the Secretary-General personally to combat thispandemic.Ukraine supports the initiative to hold a high-level meeting in June next year to review progress inthe implementation of the Declaration of Commitmenton HIV/AIDS. At the same time  we believe thatmillions of our infected fellow citizens need concreteaction. We are convinced that HIV/AIDS poses afundamental challenge  not only to human health andwell-being  but also to the very security of our world.In this regard  we attach particular significance to theOrganization’s declaration of a global emergency alertin the fight against HIV/AIDS. The main focus must beplaced on prevention and treatment of the disease. AsUkraine President Kuchma stressed last year at thehigh-level meeting on HIV/AIDS  we need to elaboratea clear system to encourage sponsorship of medicalprojects as well as to expand the educational campaignon preventing the pandemic.In the same vein  a leading role should be playedby the mass media. Ukraine has launched an activemass media campaign with the involvement of allsocial groups  and we are ready to lead a regionalmedia movement in the prevention of HIV/AIDS.Another pressing problem is trafficking inpersons  especially women and children. Ukrainespares no effort in addressing this issue. This yearUkraine became a party to the United NationsConvention against Transnational Organized Crime andits two Optional Protocols. However  tackling thoseissues requires a comprehensive approach and the closecooperation of the international community. We needto create a truly functioning and efficient mechanism tocombine the efforts of the countries of origin  transitand destination.Effective strategies to combat human traffickingshould be based on both law enforcement measures andimprovement of the economic and social conditions ofpotential victims. Ukraine welcomes the appointmentof the Commission on Human Rights SpecialRapporteur on trafficking in persons  especially inwomen and children  and stands ready to render everysupport in implementing the respective mandates.Last year the world observed the seventiethanniversary of the horrible genocidal famine  whichtook the lives of over 7 million Ukrainian people.Taking this opportunity I wish once again to expressour gratitude to all States that signed the jointstatement on the seventieth anniversary of the greatfamine of 1932-1933 in Ukraine — Holodomor — orwhose parliaments adopted acts of condemnation andsympathy  and to all organizations and individuals thattook part in the events to honour the victims of thegreat famine.The international community must thoroughlystudy that phenomenon in order to prevent itsrecurrence. We hope that the newly appointed SpecialAdviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention ofGenocide will also duly focus on this issue.Almost two decades have passed since Ukrainewas struck by another tragedy — the Chernobyldisaster. Ukraine together with other interesteddelegations put forth an initiative to hold  within theframework of the sixtieth session of United NationsGeneral Assembly in spring 2006  a special plenarymeeting to commemorate the victims of the Chernobyldisaster.Ukraine has fulfilled its commitments related tothe closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Whatneeds to be done today is to construct a new safeconfinement. We expect that funds for this purposepromised by the Group of Seven in 1995 will be fullyprovided.23Chernobyl remains a searing wound  whichproves every day how fragile our world is and howeasily nature can be damaged. No one should doubt ourcommitment to the preservation of our environment.That is why Ukraine is so sensitive to environmentalprotection  whether it concerns building of roads construction of new power plants or the reopening of anavigable waterway.It was fashionable some years ago to criticize theUnited Nations for its inability to solve the mostimportant problems. Today we all come to thisAssembly with the ever-stronger conviction that thereis no alternative to our Organization.I am confident that despite all obstacles anddoubts of the past  we can act for the attainment of theUnited Nations goals that are common to all of us. Wecan act swiftly  collectively and with a vision."
"179",7208,"URY",59,2004,"Today no one denies that globalization is here and thatit is here to stay. Not only has it changed the world ofcommunications so that now everything happens at thesame time throughout the world  but more importantly it has made historical borders irrelevant. The younggeneration has more contact with other young peopleliving thousands of miles away than they have withtheir own neighbours or family.It is absolutely true that a global culture isemerging in this world. While this is happening countries are still living on their nationalisms  theirsecular habits  their own interests and their parochialprojects that are often alien to the new realities. Thequestion that we leaders ask ourselves ó especially9those of us who represent small nations - is whetherthis inexorable change can be handled by theorganizations that we have created  or whether thoseorganizations still have a long way to go in terms ofadapting to the new reality. When we look at theimpressive success achieved by the United Nationssince San Francisco in 1944  two things seem clear.First  the institutions that we have createdrepresent the greatest and most successful effort evermade by mankind to organize peaceful coexistence andto endow the planet with the best possible instrumentsfor dealing with the important aspects of human liveswithin human society.Secondly  it is equally clear that the world haschanged so much that the current reality now farexceeds the capacity of the institutions that werecreated to address and resolve past issues  issues thattoday have taken on totally different characteristics.Suffice it to recall that the founding Members of theUnited Nations numbered 51 and that today there are191 Member States. More important  the worldíspopulation at that time was only half what it is today.And the total is inexorably rising towards 9 billion.Furthermore  over the past 40 years  scientificadvances and the ensuing technological applications haveincreased the resources of a very small group of nations leaving far behind many other countries  some of whichonly recently gained their independence and most ofwhich are rich in natural resources but lack the basicstructures needed to achieve sustainable growth -countries  moreover  where  no doubt as a consequenceof this  the population is increasing at very high ratesand where the resulting emigration to other continentswill soon create serious problems of coexistence.Uruguay has been a Member of the UnitedNations since its foundation and believes in theOrganization and in the varied multilateral agenciesthat support its efforts; we understand the need toconsider Charter revision so that nations that did notthen carry the weight they carry today can assumegreater obligations in the inescapable tasks that thesituation of mankind now imposes on us. It is time forthem to share the responsibility with the five nationsthat assumed it nearly 60 years ago.Uruguay has also been participating inpeacekeeping operations for many years. Uruguay is oneof the largest troop contributors  and is the very largestif the ratio of its small population - 3.4 million - topeacekeepers is taken into consideration. We haveparticipated in operations in Asia and in Africa  and weare currently deployed in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  Haiti  Eritrea and elsewhere.Uruguay acknowledges and welcomes the wiseEuropean Union effort to bring equality at the highestlevel to European nations with marked differences inincome compared with the richest countries. Theexamples of Ireland  Portugal  Spain and Greece which will surely be emulated for new European Unionmembers  indicate what we in the United Nations mustdo for the Congo and Haiti.There is no point in achieving peace if the UnitedNations lacks funds that can immediately be spent for thepractical benefit of peoples in extreme economicdifficulties. We must create global and largelyautonomous financial instruments to achieve those goals.That is the only way for the United Nations to succeed.A tiny nation like Haiti ó of 27 000 squarekilometres and 9 million inhabitants  where the averagenumber of children per mother is 4.7 and which lacksthe institutional and material infrastructure it needs -cannot and will not resolve its problems merelybecause a contingent of military forces from countriesof the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) iskeeping the peace.Travelling in the Congo with the troops werecently dispatched  we see exactly the same thinghappening: a nation of 2.2 million square kilometresand a population of 50 million does not have a roadgoing from one end of the country to the other. Withoutautonomous  ready and independent means of copingwith and transforming that state of affairs  the UnitedNations will not have solved anything at all even five 10  15 or 20 years from now. Yet only the UnitedNations can handle such tasks.Just more than three years since the fateful day of11 September 2001 and just over six months since thetragedy in Madrid  new and terrible forms of violencecontinue assailing other parts of the world  claiminghundreds of innocent victims ó as we have recently seenin Russia and as we see in the Middle East. This revealsthe destructive power that poses a permanent threat to theworld as a whole  a source of inescapable sadness anda cause for despair about the human condition itself.Terrorism - and a genuine commitment tocombat and defeat it - must therefore be the first item10on our international agenda. Each State  each nation  eachcommunity and each human being must contribute tothis endeavour; that is how we can help the UnitedNations to fulfil its role as universal guarantor.Combating this and other evils - hunger  poverty underdevelopment  marginalization  exclusion - requiresa United Nations that is more united  nimbler and moreeffective. That is why the Organization must be morerepresentative  more balanced and more reliable: sothat it can continue to be a reference point for the weakand a restraining influence on the strong.Here  our country has recently adopted legislationstrengthening the system of prevention and control ofmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism. Weare in compliance with nearly all current treaties in thisarea  and our legislation improves our mechanisms forinternational cooperation against money launderingand the financing of terrorism.At the Millennium Summit and in the DohaDeclaration and Monterrey Consensus we agreed onprinciples  goals and priorities  and we madecommitments which we reaffirmed a few days ago atthe summit of world leaders for the Action AgainstHunger and Poverty. If we are to attain those goals  weneed more just and equitable rules of internationaltrade. That is how to ensure that this becomes a keystage in the march towards the social and politicalstability that is today in serious jeopardy.This is particularly important since it is wellknown that States that vociferously preach free tradeand demand open markets ó which in our case arealready entirely open ó themselves impose and instituteobstacles to trade  subsidize their production in distortingways and compete with countries such as mine and manyothers  which have nothing to offer the world except thelabour of their people in the commodity and industrialsectors  which further enriches the rich countries.Uruguay attaches fundamental importance tofinancial and trade issues. In all international forums Uruguay calls for freer  more open markets. We favoura single market from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego; wesupport the Doha Agreement; we support the openingof markets. We believe in freedom  but we believe alsothat freedom is indivisible: there can be no politicalfreedom without economic freedom  and we think therecan be no economic freedom that does not go hand inhand with political freedom.We believe  therefore  that peoples can be strongonly if they can create their future in freedom. Wecannot build and stabilize democracies if women andmen cannot find an honest job to which to devote theirenergies. That goal cannot be achieved with economicassistance alone or with loans that  in the poorestcountries  are paid back only with great difficulty. Itcan be brought about only with free trade ó somethingthat the world experienced in the nineteenth century.In conclusion  Uruguay will continue to becommitted to the international system and to theprogressive development of international law  the mostrecent expression of which was the establishment ofthe International Criminal Court  whose Statute wehave ratified. We reaffirm our conviction thatmultilateralism is the main principle on which theconduct of international affairs must be based. Weexpress the hope that our region and the world as awhole will pool their efforts and work together in arealistic and committed manner. We continue to believein the United Nations as the collective instrument bestsuited to our search for peace."
"180",7255,"USA",59,2004,"Thank you for the honour ofaddressing the General Assembly. The Americanpeople respect the idealism that gave life to thisOrganization. And we respect the men and women ofthe United Nations  who stand for peace and humanrights in every part of the world. Welcome to NewYork City  and welcome to the United States ofAmerica.During the past three years  I have addressed theGeneral Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country and in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather ata time of tremendous opportunity for the UnitedNations and for all peaceful nations. For decades  thecircle of liberty  security and development has beenexpanding in our world. This progress has broughtunity to Europe  self-government to Latin America andAsia and new hope to Africa. Now we have the historic8chance to widen the circle even further  to fightradicalism and terror with justice and dignity and toachieve a true peace  founded on human freedom.The United Nations and my country share thedeepest commitments. Both the American Declarationof Independence and the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity ofevery human life. That dignity is honoured by the ruleof law  limits on the power of the State  respect forwomen  protection of private property  free speech equal justice and religious tolerance. That dignity isdishonoured by oppression  corruption  tyranny bigotry  terrorism and all violence against the innocent.Both our founding documents affirm that this brightline between justice and injustice — between right andwrong — is the same in every age  every culture andevery nation.Wise Governments also stand for these principlesfor very practical and realistic reasons. We know thatdictators are quick to choose aggression  while freenations strive to resolve differences in peace. We knowthat oppressive Governments support terror  while freeGovernments fight the terrorists in their midst. Weknow that free peoples embrace progress and life instead of becoming the recruits for murderousideologies.Every nation that wants peace will share thebenefits of a freer world. And every nation that seekspeace has an obligation to help build that world.Eventually there is no safe isolation from terrornetworks  or failed States that shelter them  or outlawregimes or weapons of mass destruction. Eventuallythere is no safety in looking away  seeking the quietlife by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others.In this young century our world needs a newdefinition of security. Our security is not merely foundin spheres of influence or some balance of power. Thesecurity of our world is found in the advancing rightsof mankind.Those rights are advancing across the world. Andacross the world  the enemies of human rights areresponding with violence. Terrorists and their alliesbelieve the Universal Declaration of Human Rights andthe United States Bill of Rights and every charter ofliberty ever written are lies to be burned and destroyedand forgotten. They believe that dictators shouldcontrol every mind and tongue in the Middle East andbeyond. They believe that suicide and torture andmurder are fully justified to serve any goal theydeclare. And they act on their beliefs.In the last year alone terrorists have attackedpolice stations and banks and commuter trains andsynagogues and a school filled with children. Thismonth in Beslan we saw once again how the terroristsmeasure their success in the death of the innocent andin the pain of grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov washeld hostage along with her son and her nephew. Hernephew did not survive. She recently visited thecemetery and saw what she called the “little graves”.She said  “I understand that there is evil in the world but what have these little creatures done?”The Russian children did nothing to deserve suchawful suffering and fright and death. The people ofMadrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul and Baghdad havedone nothing to deserve sudden and random murder.Those acts violate the standards of justice in allcultures and the principles of all religions. All civilizednations are in this struggle together and all must fightthe murderers.We are determined to destroy terror networkswherever they operate  and the United States is gratefulto every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets track down their operatives and disrupt their plans. Weare determined to end the State sponsorship of terror and my nation is grateful to all that participated in theliberation of Afghanistan. We are determined toprevent proliferation and to enforce the demands of theworld  and my nation is grateful to the soldiers of manynations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi peoplefrom an outlaw dictator.The dictator agreed in 1991  as a condition of aceasefire  to fully comply with all Security Councilresolutions  then ignored more than a decade of thoseresolutions. Finally  the Security Council promisedserious consequences for his defiance. Thecommitments we make must have meaning. When wesay “serious consequences”  for the sake of peace theremust be serious consequences. So a coalition of nationsenforced the just demands of the world.Defending our ideals is vital  but it is not enough.Our broader mission as United Nations Members is toapply those ideals to the great issues of our time. Ourwider goal is to promote hope and progress as thealternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purposeis to build a better world beyond the war on terror.9Because we believe in human dignity  the UnitedStates and many other nations have established aGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria.In three years the contributing countries have fundedprojects in more than 90 countries  and pledged a totalof $5.6 billion to those efforts. America has undertakena $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatmentand humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS  placinga special focus on 15 countries where the need is mosturgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time and our unprecedented commitment will bring newhope to those who have walked too long in the shadowof death.Because we believe in human dignity  the UnitedStates and many other nations have joined together toconfront the evil of trafficking in human beings. Weare supporting organizations that rescue the victims passing stronger anti-trafficking laws and warningtravellers that they will be held to account forsupporting this modern form of slavery. Women andchildren should never be exploited for pleasure orgreed  anywhere on Earth.Because we believe in human dignity  we shouldtake seriously the protection of life from exploitationunder any pretext. In this session  the GeneralAssembly will consider a draft resolution sponsored byCosta Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on humancloning. I support that draft resolution and urge allGovernments to affirm a basic ethical principle: nohuman life should ever be produced or destroyed forthe benefit of another.Because we believe in human dignity  the UnitedStates and many other nations have changed the waywe fight poverty  curb corruption and provide aid. In2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus  a boldapproach that links new aid from developed nations toreal reform in developing ones. And through theMillennium Challenge Account  my nation isincreasing our aid to developing nations that expandeconomic freedom and invest in the education andhealth of their own people.Because we believe in human dignity  the UnitedStates and many other nations have acted to lift thecrushing burden of debt that limits the growth ofdeveloping economies and holds millions of people inpoverty. Since those efforts began in 1996  poorcountries with the heaviest debt burdens have receivedmore than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent thebuild-up of future debt  my country and other nationshave agreed that international financial institutionsshould increasingly provide new aid in the form ofgrants rather than loans.Because we believe in human dignity  the worldmust have more effective means to stabilize regions inturmoil and to halt religious violence and ethniccleansing. We must create permanent capabilities torespond to future crises.The United States and Italy have proposed aGlobal Peace Operations Initiative. Group of Eight(G-8) countries will train 75 000 peacekeepers —initially from Africa — so they can conduct operationson that continent and elsewhere. The countries of theG-8 will help that peacekeeping force with deploymentand logistical needs.At this hour  the world is witnessing terriblesuffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region ofthe Sudan  crimes my Government has concluded aregenocide. The United States played a key role in effortsto broker a ceasefire  and we are providinghumanitarian assistance to the Sudanese people.Rwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in the Sudanto help improve security so that aid can be delivered.The Security Council adopted a new resolution thatsupports an expanded African Union force to helpprevent further bloodshed and that urges theGovernment of the Sudan to stop flights by militaryaircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of theCouncil on this timely and necessary action. I call onthe Government of the Sudan to honour the ceasefire itsigned  and to stop the killing in Darfur.Because we believe in human dignity  peacefulnations must stand for the advance of democracy. Noother system of government has done more to protectminorities  to secure the rights of labour  to raise thestatus of women or to channel human energy to thepursuits of peace. We have witnessed the rise ofdemocratic Governments in predominantly Hindu andMuslim  Buddhist  Jewish and Christian cultures.Democratic institutions have taken root in modernsocieties and in traditional societies. When it comes tothe desire for liberty and justice  there is no clash ofcivilizations. People everywhere are capable offreedom and worthy of freedom.Finding the full promise of representativeGovernment takes time  as America has found in twocenturies of debate and struggle. Nor is there only one10form of representative Government  becausedemocracies by definition take on the unique characterof the peoples that create them. Yet this much we knowwith certainty: the desire for freedom resides in everyhuman heart  and that desire cannot be containedforever by prison walls or martial laws or secret police.Over time and across the Earth  freedom will find away.Freedom is finding a way in Iraq andAfghanistan  and we must continue to show ourcommitment to democracies in those nations. Theliberty that many have won at a cost must be secured.As Members of the United Nations  we all have a stakein the success of the world’s newest democracies. Notlong ago  outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabulthreatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. Thoseregimes destabilized one of the world’s most vital andmost volatile regions. They brutalized their peoples indefiance of all civilized norms.Today  the Iraqi and Afghan peoples are on thepath to democracy and freedom. The Governments thatare rising will pose no threat to others. Instead ofharbouring terrorists  they are fighting terrorist groups.And this progress is good for the long-term security ofall of us. The Afghan people are showing extraordinarycourage under difficult conditions. They are fighting todefend their nation from Taliban hold-outs and helpingto strike against the terrorist killers. They are revivingtheir economy. They have adopted a Constitutionthat protects the rights of all  while honouring theirnation’s most cherished traditions. More than 10million Afghan citizens — over four million of themwomen — are now registered to vote in next month’spresidential election. To any who still would questionwhether Muslim societies can be democratic societies the Afghan people are giving their answer.Since the last general debate of this GeneralAssembly  the people of Iraq have regainedsovereignty. Today  in this Hall  the Prime Minister ofIraq and his delegation represent a country that hasrejoined the community of nations. The Government ofPrime Minister Allawi has earned the support of everynation that believes in self-determination and desirespeace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511(2003) and 1546 (2004)  the world is providing thatsupport. The United Nations and its Member nationsmust respond to Prime Minister Allawi’s request anddo more to help build an Iraq that is secure democratic  federal and free.A democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies becauseterrorists know the stakes in that country. They knowthat a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be adecisive blow against their ambitions for that region.So a terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda is nowone of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraqtoday  conducting a campaign of bombings againstcivilians and the beheadings of bound men. Coalitionforces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terroristsand foreign fighters so that peaceful nations around theworld will never have to face them within our ownborders.Our coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqisecurity force. The North Atlantic Treaty Organizationis providing vital training to that force. More than 35nations have contributed money and expertise to helprebuild Iraq’s infrastructure and  as the Iraqi InterimGovernment moves towards national elections officials from the United Nations are helping Iraqisbuild the infrastructure of democracy. Those selflesspeople are doing heroic work and are carrying on thegreat legacy of Sergio Vieira de Mello.As we have seen in other countries  one of themain terrorist goals is to undermine  disrupt andinfluence election outcomes. We can expect terroristattacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approachnational elections. The work ahead is demanding  butthose difficulties will not shake our conviction that thefuture of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty.The proper response to difficulty is not to retreat — itis to prevail.The advance of freedom always carries a cost paid by the bravest among us. America mourns thelosses to our nation and to many others  and today Iassure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq  and everyenemy of liberty: We will stand with the people ofAfghanistan and Iraq until their hopes of freedom andsecurity are fulfilled.These two nations will be a model for the broaderMiddle East  a region where millions have been deniedbasic human rights and simple justice. For too long many nations  including my own  tolerated and evenexcused oppression in the Middle East in the name ofstability. Oppression became common  but stabilitynever arrived. We must take a different approach. Wemust help the reformers of the Middle East as theywork for freedom and strive to build a community ofpeaceful  democratic nations.11That commitment to democratic reform isessential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peacewill not be achieved by Palestinian rulers whointimidate opposition  tolerate corruption and maintainties to terrorist groups. The long-suffering Palestinianpeople deserve better. They deserve true leaderscapable of creating and governing a free and peacefulPalestinian State.Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recentmonths  good will and hard effort can achieve thepromise of the road map to peace. Those who wouldlead a new Palestinian State should adopt peacefulmeans to achieve the rights of their people and createthe reformed institutions of a stable democracy. ArabStates should end incitement in their own media  cutoff public and private funding for terrorism  andestablish normal relations with Israel. Israel shouldimpose a settlement freeze  dismantle unauthorizedoutposts  end the daily humiliation of the Palestinianpeople  and avoid any actions that prejudice finalnegotiations. And world leaders should withdraw allfavour and support from any Palestinian ruler who failshis people and betrays their cause.The democratic hopes we see growing in theMiddle East are growing everywhere. In the words ofthe Burmese democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi:“We do not accept the notion that democracy is aWestern value. To the contrary  democracy simplymeans good Government rooted in responsibility transparency and accountability.”Here at the United Nations  Members know this to betrue. In recent years  this Organization has helpedcreate a new democracy in East Timor and the UnitedNations has aided other nations in making thetransition to self-rule.Because I believe that the advance of liberty isthe path to both a safer and better world  today Ipropose establishing a democracy fund within theUnited Nations. This is a great calling for this greatOrganization. The fund would help countries lay thefoundations of democracy by instituting the rule of law independent courts  a free press  political parties andtrade unions. Money from the fund would also help setup voter precincts and polling places and support thework of election monitors. To show our commitment tothe new democracy fund  the United States will makean initial contribution  and I urge all other nations tocontribute as well.Today I have outlined a broad agenda to advancehuman dignity and enhance the security of all of us.The defeat of terror  the protection of human rights  thespread of prosperity  the advance of democracy —these causes  these ideals  call us to great work in theworld. Each of us alone can only do so much. Togetherwe can accomplish so much more.History will honour the high ideals of thisOrganization. The Charter states them with clarity: “tosave succeeding generations from the scourge of war ...to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights ... topromote social progress and better standards of life inlarger freedom”.Let history also record that our generation ofleaders followed through on these ideals  even inadversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade members of the United Nations did not grow weary inour duties  or waver in meeting them. I am confidentthat this young century will be liberty’s century. Ibelieve we will rise to this moment  because I know thecharacter of so many nations and leaders representedhere today. And I have faith in the transforming powerof freedom.May God bless you."
"181",7278,"UZB",59,2004,"Allow me  first of all to congratulate you  Sir  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofGabon  on your election as the President of the GeneralAssembly and to wish you every success in thisimportant position. I would also like to extend ourappreciation to Mr. Julian Hunte for the excellentorganization of the previous session.The serious challenges to global stability andsustainable development that the internationalcommunity faces vindicate the urgent need to furtherdevelop the legal and institutional foundations ofmultilateral cooperation. There is no doubt that thecentral role in coordinating these efforts belongs to theUnited Nations. It is important  today as never before to define the direction of the dynamic adaptation of theUnited Nations to current realities  based on theOrganization’s unique experience of over half acentury  and to find adequate responses to the pressingissues of the contemporary world.Developments in the Central Asian regionprovide a vivid demonstration of the intermingling ofthe contradictory processes that are unfolding aroundthe globe. The aspirations of the peoples of CentralAsia to fully integrate into the world community  tocreate conditions for sustainable stability and economicdevelopment are facing serious challenges. The regionis faced with a combination of transnational threats namely terrorism  extremism and drug trafficking.Similar patterns can be observed in other regions of theworld as well.Not a single day passes without terrorist actstaking place somewhere in the world. It is obvious andundeniable that international terrorism has challengedthe civilized world. It makes no exceptions and doesnot distinguish between places  nationalities  religionsor social systems. It sows death and devastation in bothaffluent and developing nations. We need to admit thatinternational terrorism  which is capable of quicklytransforming and adapting to the changingcircumstances of the contemporary world  is trying toimpose its terms and conditions and keep entire regionsin fear.From the outset  Uzbekistan has firmly andvigorously supported the efforts of the anti-terroristcoalition aimed at eradicating transnational threats.The political leadership of Uzbekistan is deeplycommitted to the fight against this plague of thetwenty-first century and calls for a consolidation of theinternational community’s efforts in this area.However  effectively fighting internationalterrorism requires  above all  combating its ideologicalsources. It is vital to oppose the ideology of extremismand fanaticism and to outlaw militant radical religiousgroups that nurture international terrorism.At the same time  Uzbekistan strongly opposesany kind of allegations or assertions linkinginternational terrorism with the ever-growing religionof Islam  which has made an immense contribution tothe history of humanity. Uzbekistan  home of thegreatest thinkers and philosophers of the East  isadamantly pursuing an all-out support of traditional enlightened Islam. Only by promoting and encouragingideas of an enlightened and tolerant Islam can weeffectively withstand militant  politicized extremistfactions and avert further confrontations in the world.Uzbekistan holds that  in reviewing the urgentissues of global security  the regional agenda should begiven priority. Only by means of secure and stableregions can we gradually move towards global security.The establishment of a nuclear-weapons-free zone inCentral Asia remains one of the priorities of ourforeign policy. We again call upon the permanentmembers of the Security Council to develop — incooperation with the States of the region — aconsolidated position on the provisions of the treatyand its protocol. We trust that the establishment of thisnuclear-weapons-free zone would become an importantelement of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.Many issues of regional development are directlylinked to the processes taking place in Afghanistan. Webelieve that Afghanistan is historically andgeographically a part of Central Asia. Uzbekistan hasbeen giving all possible assistance to the Afghanpeople for the social and economic reconstruction ofthe country and its harmonious integration intoregional structures. The Government of Uzbekistan  incooperation with United Nations agencies  has set upand is successfully implementing a deliverymechanism for international humanitarian assistance toAfghanistan via Uzbekistan. To date  over 2.5 milliontons of such cargo has passed through our territory. Inaddition  we are doing all we can to reduce transit costsand improve the service infrastructure.In light of the continuous threat of narcoticsproliferation from Afghanistan  Central Asia  on the24frontline of combating narco-aggression  is facing theproblem of effectively countering this global menace.We look forward to the international community’s firmand continuous support of Uzbekistan’s initiative toestablish a Central Asian regional information andcoordination centre to combat transborder crime relatedto illegal drug trafficking.The United Nations has been present inUzbekistan for over a decade. During this period  theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) hascarried out numerous important projects aimed atstrengthening the country’s potential in implementingreforms  protecting the environment and creatingsustainable sources of income. We truly appreciate this.In this regard  we look forward to assistance fromUNDP and other United Nations agencies inimplementing Uzbekistan’s initiative to establish aCentral Asian common market. This would contributenot only to creating a large and robust regional marketand attracting more foreign investment and moderntechnologies  but also to properly addressing the socialand environmental problems of Central Asia  includingits sustainable development and economic prosperity.Overcoming the transportation andcommunication isolation of the region is another toppriority. In that context  I would like to draw theAssembly’s attention to the multilateral initiative toestablish a trans-Afghan transport corridor  whichwould link Central Asia with the Persian Gulf. Theimplementation of that project would significantlyexpand trade and economic relations andfundamentally improve the region’s economicprospects.We agree with the view of the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  that the present juncture is of crucialimportance for the United Nations. There is no othermultilateral forum similar to the United Nations  inwhich countries that differ from one another in termsof cultural and historical heritage  economic potentialand geographic location can work together as equalpartners.In the context of the current  increasinglycomplex globalization processes  the strengthening ofthe Security Council is of paramount significance.Uzbekistan supports the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil in both categories of membership  taking intoaccount the political and economic capabilities ofcountries  geographical representation and othercriteria. We reiterate our support for the inclusion ofGermany and Japan in the Security Council aspermanent members.In conclusion  I should like once again tounderscore the fact that Uzbekistan is confident thatthe United Nations will retain its role as the main pillarof the international security and cooperationarchitecture. We believe that the invaluable potential ofthe United Nations  which withstood all the upheavalsof the previous century  will long serve the cause ofconsolidating our efforts in the face of globalchallenges."
"182",7290,"VAT",59,2004,"The Holy See ishonoured to take part in the general debate of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations for the firsttime since the Assembly adopted resolution 58/314 on1 July 2004  which formalized and specified the rightsand prerogatives of its status as a Permanent Observer a status which the Holy See has enjoyed since 1964.It is therefore my pleasant duty to express sinceregratitude to all the Member States. In approving theaforesaid resolution  they signalled once again theparticular bond of cooperation between the ApostolicSee and the United Nations  already underlined byPope John Paul II on his first visit to this Assemblyexactly 25 years ago. In this significant circumstance  Iam honoured to convey to you  Sir  and to all of yougathered here to represent your noble countries  therespectful and cordial greetings of Pope John Paul II. Ibring a special greeting to the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan  and also to hisworthy assistants. Their work  as recorded in theannual report of the Secretary General (A/59/1) withreference  above all  to conflict prevention andpeacekeeping in the world  deserves the appreciationand gratitude of us all.Several of the themes included in the agenda ofthe General Assembly may be considered essential forattaining the supreme objective of peace and for thefuture of humanity. To quote only a few: the UnitedNations and a new global human order; pursuit of theMillennium Goals; total and general disarmament;globalization and interdependence; internationalmigration and development; human rights; and humancloning. I shall limit myself to a brief presentation ofthe Holy See’s position regarding some of those issues.Among the Millennium Goals  pride of placegoes to the theme of poverty and development. I saypride of place  because it concerns the right tosubsistence of hundreds of millions of human beings surviving — as best they can — below the threshold ofwhat is necessary  as well as tens of millions ofundernourished children unjustly deprived of the rightto live.In order to find a lasting solution to thoseinhumane conditions  it is necessary to progress  underthe aegis of the United Nations  towards a moreflexible and more just international trade system.Furthermore  financial structures are needed whichfavour development and the cancellation of foreigndebt for the poorest countries. Likewise  the results ofscientific research and technology must be generouslyshared  especially in the field of health.On that matter I need say no more  since the HolySee’s position has already been presented once againby the Cardinal Secretary of State  at the conference onhunger and poverty held in New York on20 September. I repeat only this: the urgency of thesituation cannot tolerate delay. It is a question ofjustice.Of immediate relevance to the supreme good ofpeace is the theme of total and general disarmament. Ifit is true that the production and sale of arms to othercountries endangers peace  it follows that severe andeffective international controls are needed. Thecommitment of the United Nations in that area isattested to by the various conventions it has supportedwith reference to weapons of mass destruction as wellas conventional weapons. But we are only at thebeginning of a long process  with huge economicinterests as obstacles along our path towards peace.The problem of weapons of mass destruction isclearly to be distinguished from that of conventionalweapons; but the latter have a terrible and unendingcontemporary relevance in the numerous armedconflicts that stain the world with blood  and also interrorism.Regional armed conflicts are so numerous thatthere is no time to list them all. However  there aresome that I cannot omit to mention. Above all there isthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict is notsimply contained within the narrow territorialboundaries of the region itself. Those directly involvedare the Israeli Government and the PalestinianAuthority  and they have the grave duty to demonstratetheir desire for peace. With this end in view  a roadmap has been drawn up and formally accepted by bothparties; may they proceed along it with determinationand courage.26But that conflict is also followed with intenseinterest and often with passion by large sections ofhumanity. The Catholic Church  present in Palestinefor 2 000 years  invites all concerned to turn theirbacks on any action likely to destroy confidence and toutter generous words of peace and make bold gesturesof peace. And if peace is the fruit of justice  let it notbe forgotten — as Pope John Paul II has remindedus — that there can be no justice without forgiveness;indeed  without mutual forgiveness.Then there is the Iraqi conflict. The position ofthe Holy See concerning the military action of 2002-2003 is well known. Everyone can see that it did notlead to a safer world either inside or outside Iraq. TheHoly See believes it is now imperative to support thepresent Iraqi Government in its efforts to bring thecountry to normality and to a political system that issubstantially democratic and in harmony with thevalues of its historic traditions.The Holy See is gravely concerned about variousAfrican countries scarred by bloodshed arising frommutual conflicts and even more from internal strife.They need active international solidarity: morespecifically  and connaturally  the African Union needsto intervene authoritatively so as to bring all legitimateinterested parties around a negotiating table. TheAfrican Union has already demonstrated its ability toact successfully in some cases: it deserves recognitionand support.I have mentioned the theme of terrorism  anaberrant phenomenon  utterly unworthy of man  whichhas already assumed global dimensions: today no Statecan presume to be safe from it. Hence  it seemsobvious that terrorists can be effectively challengedonly through a concerted  multilateral approach respecting the ius gentium  and not through a policy ofunilateralism. No one is in any doubt that the fightagainst terrorism means  first and foremost neutralizing its active breeding grounds. But theunderlying causes are many and complex: political social  cultural  religious; for this reason  what is stillmore important is long-term action  directed  withforesight and patience  at its roots  designed to stop itsspreading further and to extinguish its deadlycontagious effects.The Holy See  and the entire Catholic Church  isactively involved in this work. It is involved throughits educational and charitable institutions  which wherever they are  are committed to raising the culturaland social levels of the populations  without anydiscrimination  especially on religious grounds; it isinvolved through interreligious dialogue  which hasgrown in intensity ever since the Second VaticanEcumenical Council. The Holy See will always begrateful to the authorities of other religions thatdemonstrate openness to such dialogue  and also to thecivil authorities that encourage it  without any politicalinterference  respecting the distinction between thereligious and the civil sphere and the fundamentalhuman right to freedom of religion.The right to freedom of religion is sanctioned together with other fundamental rights  in theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights  adopted bythe General Assembly of the United Nations on10 December 1948. Such fundamental human rightsstand or fall together. And man stands or falls withthem.For this reason  every effort has to be made todefend them in all fields. For this to happen  oneparticular danger must be avoided  which is foundtoday in various countries and social settings. It is theidea that these fundamental human rights  assanctioned by the Universal Declaration  areexpressions of a particular culture and are thereforehighly relative. No  at heart  they are expressions of thehuman being as such  even if the fact remains that  atdifferent times and in different cultures  they may havebeen and may still be differently applied  in more orless adequate and acceptable ways.Among the fundamental rights  or rather foremostamong them  as the Universal Declaration explicitlystates  is the right to life of every individual. The HolySee could say a great deal about the right to life ofevery individual  because the essence of its message isthe gospel of life.The question of human cloning comes under thesame broad heading. In a few weeks  this GeneralAssembly will resume its debate on human cloning. Inthis respect  the Holy See is pleased to reaffirm itscommitment to support the advancement of medicalscience  conducted always in a manner that respectshuman dignity  because it offers healing and cures forvarious diseases. With this end in view  the Holy Seereiterates its support for the procurement and use ofadult stem cells and believes that the way forward is to27draw up and implement a clear convention that willresult in a comprehensive ban on human cloning.“Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity andof the equal and inalienable rights of all membersof the human family is the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world ”So begins the preamble to the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. It is one of the many undeniable meritsof the United Nations to have proposed to theconscience of all humanity  more than 50 years ago these secure principles for progress towards peace.Over the years  however  the United Nations hasneeded to adapt its procedures to take account ofdevelopments on the world political scene so that itswork for the promotion of peace can become moreeffective. The first results of the high-level commissionset up for this purpose by Secretary-General KofiAnnan were published last June. The Holy See will beable to offer some explicit evaluation on the occasionof the debate on the subject to be held next week.For now  I should simply like to recall Pope JohnPaul II’s words for this year’s International Day ofPeace. He reminded us that humanity today is in a newand more difficult phase of its genuine development and he called for a greater degree of internationalordering. This could be brought about by givingorganizations like the United Nations specialprerogatives to facilitate action to prevent conflicts attimes of international crisis  and also  when absolutelynecessary  humanitarian intervention — that is  actionaimed at disarming the aggressor.Yet  the greater degree of international orderingcould be achieved still more effectively if the UnitedNations were to rise to the status of a moral centre where all nations of the world feel at home anddevelop a shared awareness of being  as it were  afamily of nations.Now and in the future  the United Nations cancount on the Holy See to be not only an attentivePermanent Observer  but also a travelling companion ever ready to support its complex and difficult activity and also to collaborate in a spirit of freedom andfriendship with all the Member States."
"183",7325,"VCT",59,2004,"The fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly coincideswith the twenty-fifth anniversary of the independence ofSaint Vincent and the Grenadines. The last quarter of acentury has presented a mighty challenge for thepeople of my country: to develop in a worldincreasingly indifferent to the particular problems ofsmall  poor  developing States. But it is a challengethat the citizens of Saint Vincent and the Grenadineshave embraced with courage  fortitude and hope —9never doubting our ability to survive  thrive andultimately prosper as we contribute to the uplifting ofour unique  independent  distinctive and nobleCaribbean civilization. Our country has made progressthus far  but much more remains to be done. We lookforward to succeeding in our quest for self-mastery.I would like to congratulate you  Mr. President on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-ninthsession of the General Assembly. We are confident thatyou will perform your duties with dignity and skill. Letme just say that you have a hard act to follow. Yourpredecessor  our Mr. Julian Hunte  is a distinguishedson of the Caribbean who hails from our sister island Saint Lucia. He made us proud in his role as Presidentof the General Assembly.The peoples of the Caribbean and the southernUnited States are still traumatized by the devastationcaused by hurricanes this season. Jamaica  theBahamas  the Cayman Islands  Haiti  Cuba and otherCaribbean countries  including my own  have beenseverely affected. But our nearest neighbour  Grenada has suffered cataclysmic destruction and is now in astate of national crisis. We offer our profoundcondolences to the families and loved ones of thosewho have died in the hurricanes. Saint Vincent and theGrenadines and other Caribbean nations have reachedout a helping hand to Grenada  but the magnitude ofthe devastation in that country on 7 September isbeyond the capacity of the Caribbean to addresssatisfactorily by itself. Indeed  Grenada has become aninternational responsibility.I therefore reiterate the call of the CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) for the urgent convening ofan international donors’ conference to address thematter of Grenada’s utter devastation and itsreconstruction. Simply put  Grenada has moved fromthe status of a middle-income developing country witha modern  sophisticated society and well run democratic State machinery to a devastated land in amatter of three hours of pounding from hurricane Ivan.Today in Grenada there is no functioning economy anda highly traumatized civil society.Arising from all that is a strategic issue in ourquest to turn Grenada’s setback into a regional advancefor a more profound and meaningful Caribbeanintegration. Hurricane Ivan has spoken eloquently tothe fact that nature has made our region one. Historyhas further moulded us as one people who were drawnoriginally from diverse lands and cultures. Yet we inthe Caribbean continue to buck  rather than accommodateourselves appropriately to  both nature and history. Thatis a sort of vanity that we can ill-afford.It is tragic that it takes a catastrophe of thisnature to hammer home the point that the small islanddeveloping States have been making for some time namely  that there is a need for special and differentialtreatment because of  among other things  ourvulnerability to natural disasters.I repeat  without exaggeration  that HurricaneIvan  in a few short hours  reduced Grenada to rubbleand  at a stroke  undid the hard work and achievementsof its people since independence in 1974. We in SaintVincent and the Grenadines feel their pain and knowthat  but for the grace of God and the vagaries ofnature  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines would havesuffered the same fate.Accordingly  the crisis in Grenada  occasioned bynature  prompts Saint Vincent and the Grenadines togive the highest priority to the international conferenceto be held in Mauritius in January of next year  whenthe specific and distinct problems of small islanddeveloping States will be highlighted. We will bestressing the need for the international community totake urgent action on the problem of global warming andclimate change  which  if left unchecked  could lead to aglobal human and economic calamity in this century.The international community must become focused onthe avoidance of that threatened apocalypse.Since we met here last year  the CaribbeanCommunity has faced another crisis in our region — thistime  a political one — as one of our member States Haiti  descended into chaos  violence and anarchy. Wesaw an elected head of State removed in circumstancesthat bring no credit to our hemisphere. We remaindeeply troubled by the controversial interruption of thedemocratic process that took place in the early hours ofthe morning of 28 February this year in Port-au-Prince.It is worth remembering that CARICOM States wereinstrumental in preparing a plan of Action for Haiti toensure that the Constitution of that country wasrespected and to create the basis for a mobilization ofresources to avert a humanitarian disaster.On 25 February 2004  CARICOM was successfulin having the matter raised at a meeting of the SecurityCouncil. On that occasion  we went to the Councilarmed with a draft resolution. We pleaded for the10international community to respond to the rapidlydeteriorating situation in Haiti. The draft resolutionpresented by CARICOM to the Security Council wasnoted but politely ignored. The rest is history. TheGovernment and people of Saint Vincent and theGrenadines are anxious to help the Haitian people inthe sorry plight in which they currently findthemselves. But before engaging politically with theso-called interim Government of Haiti  we must see among other things  unequivocal evidence on theground of advances in democracy and freedom andcredible guarantees of free and fair elections within areasonable time. A regime that tries an indictedmurderer at midnight  one who was hailed by the veryregime as a liberator  and then frees him before the firstcock crows  has failed the most elemental tests ofjustice  freedom and democracy.The death and destruction occasioned by HurricaneJean in Haiti demand our humanitarian assistance  notour political engagement with the Haitian regime.The dire situation in the Darfur region of Sudanhas caused great distress to the Government and peopleof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. My own personalgrief prompted me to write letters in May of this yearto several world leaders  including Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan  offering the slender resources of mycountry to assist in whatever small way we could toalleviate the suffering of the afflicted Sudanese people.Most of those I addressed responded positively. It istrue that — thanks in large measure to the diligence ofvarious journalists and the news media — this tragedyhas now been brought forcefully to internationalattention. But the question we must nevertheless askourselves is this: has the international communityreacted in an appropriate way to this calamity  or havewe merely engaged in the usual perfunctory androutine denunciations? The images and reports comingout of Darfur are a chilling reminder of man’sinhumanity to man and a haunting condemnation ofthose who can truly help but who stand by idly ordownplay this humanitarian disaster callously. In thatregard  the Government of Sudan must shoulder itsresponsibility to its citizens and to humanity.Three months have gone by since I wrote to theSecretary-General  and this massive human tragedycontinues to unfold before our appalled eyes. I suggestthat we cannot allow the bloodbath to continue. Wemust save those who can still be saved in what havebecome the killing fields of Africa. The genocide ofyesterday in Rwanda stands as a monument of shameto the international community. As an internationalcommunity we must today take the shame out of oureyes in Darfur with urgent practical measures.A similar effort is required to address the harshconditions of life of other peoples  including the heroicnation of Palestine  whose humanity is being dailyassailed by outside forces.I would like to express  on behalf of the people ofSaint Vincent and the Grenadines  our deepestsympathy to the Government and people of the RussianFederation on the tragic and inexplicable events inBeslan on 3 September. A tragedy of that magnitude and especially the slaughter of so many innocentchildren  cannot fail to cause heartfelt sorrow.Since 11 September 2001  the fight againstinternational terrorism has intensified on all fronts. It isright and proper that rich and poor countries be engagedin the ongoing war on the barbarism of terror. SaintVincent and the Grenadines is a reliable partner in theglobal struggle against the evil of terrorism. Still  it isnecessary for me to point out that the cost of being areliable participant in that war is a heavy burden on themeagre resources of developing countries like SaintVincent and the Grenadines. Our internationalobligations and circumstances necessarily pull us intothat war  which we did not occasion or initiate. Yet webear that imposed burden with equanimity and pain. This body  however  must be reminded yet againthat there is another terrorism that we must fightrelentlessly. It is the terrorism of war  poverty illiteracy and disease  including HIV/AIDS. We mustnever forget  either  that daily hunger for 1 billionpersons worldwide is truly a weapon of massdestruction. Together we must fight that terrorism too.Developed countries cannot allow trade regimes andmarket conditions to further impoverish the poor  as hasbeen the case with banana farmers in the Caribbean  andstill trumpet that they are helping the poor.The case for a judicious and balanced reform ofthe United Nations to better reflect the reality of thetwenty-first century is unanswerably strong. We mustredouble our collective efforts to persuade those who fear unreasonably  the consequences of a just reform. We mustnot permit entrenched power to defeat right reason.Since Saint Vincent and the Grenadines becamean independent State  it has had unbroken diplomatic11relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan. We seethat country of liberty and democracy as a mostimportant component of the magnificent Chinesecivilization. Taiwan has the world’s seventeenth largesteconomy and the fifteenth largest trading volumeinternationally  and is third in the global ranking of theextent of foreign exchange reserves held. Taiwan’s 23million people ought properly to be represented in thisuniversal body by the Government of their choice. It isa mistake to continue to deny Taiwan internationalmembership of organizations. The relations betweenSaint Vincent and the Grenadines and Taiwan havebeen exemplary. Our friendship demands that we pleadtheir just cause.I conclude with these observations. Some Statesboast ownership of boundless territory  vast naturalresources and potent firepower; but none of thosefactors by themselves  or a combination of all three guarantee peace or prosperity. In some other Statespoverty  hunger conflict and disease are the norm. If instead of investing in war — knowing its certain sideeffect of the waste of young  innocent lives — nationscooperated with each other  striving for ways to solveproblems common to all  it is just possible that theworld we bequeath to our children will be morepeaceful and richer in the ways that matter andboasting cleaner air and a healthier environment.Internationally  and in our own countries  let usemphasize the power of love rather than the love ofpower. Let us extol not the rightness of power but therighteousness contained in our human condition."
"184",7372,"VEN",59,2004,"Thereare moments we can describe as historical turningpoints  when nations and peoples must decide whichside they are on. This is one of these moments  whenhistory will judge us and examine if we weredemocratic leaders that represented the will of ourpeoples.It is clear that the peoples of the world are takinga stand against neo-liberal economics and war. Theyare fighting against those who would impose their willby military force and economic violence. They areresisting those who would undermine and evenoverthrow the basic principles that founded thisOrganization that brings us together today. Under suchconditions  Venezuela echoes the call of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  that all the nationsthat proclaim the rule of law in their territory respect itabroad.As you know  the majority of the peoples andGovernments of the world took a stand against theillegal war in Iraq. In this context  Venezuela reaffirmsthe words of President Rodríguez Zapatero that peaceis a task that demands more courage  moredetermination and more heroism than war.The principal question for us is now thefollowing: are we building a world of real democracy equality and justice or a world led by the tyranny ofeconomic and military power? The people ofVenezuela were faced with such a decision last month with a referendum on the presidency. In fact  in the lastsix years  Venezuelans have participated in eightdemocratic procedures  including referendums andelections. The 1999 Bolivarian Constitution ofVenezuela allows for a mid-term referendum on arecall of the popular vote. On 15 August of this year citizens of Venezuela clearly exercised theirconstitutional right and  in an historic referendumnever before seen in the history of the world  ratifiedthe mandate of President Hugo Chávez Frías  thusconfirming the democratic process of structuraltransformation led by our President.Since the end of the last millennium  we havewitnessed tremendous dissent from citizens of theworld against neo-liberalism and war. In my country by the late eighties  a set of structural adjustments developed under the influence of the main centres ofneo-liberal capitalism  was met with a popular uprisingthat paralysed the country  leaving an indelible mark onour people’s minds. That resistance  popularly knownas “El Caracazo”  was perhaps the first protest againstneo-liberalism. The poor took control of the capital Caracas  as well as cities across the country todemonstrate their discontent with increasing povertyand the unjust distribution of the profits from ournation’s oil wealth. The ruling Government of the dayresponded by sending in armed forces to suppress theprotests  killing thousands of people. That was apainfully tragic moment for the people of Venezuela.Nevertheless  that event provoked the necessaryconsciousness  igniting a political awakening amongthe people that allowed them to unite their voices in thefight against neo-liberalism.Over the next decade  we witnessed protestsagainst the World Trade Organization and against neo-44liberalism in Chiapas  Davos  Seattle  Prague  QuebecCity and Genoa. Wherever the architects of neo-liberalism gathered  they were met with massiveprotests in the streets.We also witnessed the desperate actions of thebrave South Korean farmer in Cancún  who gave hislife to call attention to the plight of his fellow farmerson the brink of disaster throughout the world.The war in Iraq only strengthened the globalprotests. On 15 February 2003  an estimated 30 millionpeople around the world marched in protest anddisbelief  unwilling to stand idly by as once again theworld’s screams fell on deaf ears  as not-so-smartbombs fell on little children without knowing why. Ifwe combine the protests against neo-liberalglobalization with the anti-war demonstrations  we willfind a global rebellion of revolutionary proportions hasstarted. What we need to decide now is whether wewill march in the streets alongside our people or hideourselves away in an ivory tower.My fellow leaders  have we no eyes and ears?Can we not see the suffering? Can we not hear the criesof the poor  the disenfranchised  the disappeared andthe desolate? Can we afford to shirk thatresponsibility?According to the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP)  44 per cent of Latin Americanslive below the poverty line. Although Latin America isnot the only region to face that reality  it is aparticularly conspicuous example because it representsthe laboratory of the neo-liberal project. Structuraladjustment  as prescribed by the WashingtonConsensus  came early to Latin America  and itsapplication here became the model for the neo-liberalization of the former communist-bloc countriesin the 1990s.Besides being the initial site of neo-liberalism’sdevastating experiment  Latin America was also thefirst to experience anti-neo-liberal explosion. LastMarch  UNDP released a report entitled “Democracy inLatin America”  which highlighted a startlingrevelation: more than half of Latin Americans wouldprefer dictatorship over democracy if an authoritarianregime would solve their economic problems.A second report  released this past August by theprivate firm Latinobarómetro  came to a similarlydepressing conclusion — but with one notableexception: between 1996 and 2004 support fordemocracy actually grew in Venezuela  much more sothan in any other country in the region. In Venezuelasupport for democracy has undoubtedly increased.Could it be that there is a direct correlation betweenthose findings and the fact that Venezuela is activelypursuing a viable alternative to market democracy?The Nobel Prize-winning economist  AmartyaSen  affirms that democracy is the best remedy forhunger. Indeed  in Venezuela  under the leadership ofPresident Hugo Chávez Frías  we achieved that goal bygiving power to the poor. To reduce poverty  it isnecessary to increase democracy. There is no otherway. Democracy is also the only way to defeatterrorism. No matter if poverty and hunger create theconditions for its existence  there are no “good” and“bad” terrorists. There is only one terrorism —reprehensible  detestable and cowardly. But  onceagain  only through greater democracy can we defeat it.What the UNDP report reveals is that LatinAmericans have lost faith in a model of democracywhose scope is limited to political representation. It isa model that has entirely ignored the economic  socialand participatory facets of democracy and which hasconsequently completely failed to reflect the popularwill. As Simon Bolívar  our visionary liberator advocated two centuries ago  the best form ofgovernment is one that provides the highest degree ofhappiness  stability and social security for its people.A few days ago  President Lula of Brazil chaireda hugely successful meeting of world leaders on thetheme “Action Against Hunger and Poverty”. Thatwonderful initiative  co-sponsored by PresidentsChirac  Lagos Escobar and Rodríguez Zapatero expressed our common vision to fight against povertyand social injustice to guarantee security andsustainable development in both the North and theSouth. Our absolute support for that initiative isexpressed in the document on the subject of endingpoverty and giving power to the poor which wedistributed to Members at the beginning of the GeneralAssembly session.To that end we recognize the need to go beyondthe traditional official development assistanceframework. Venezuela’s contribution to the fightagainst hunger represents a genuine attempt to placethe tools of development in the hands of those whoneed it most. In shifting from food aid to food45sovereignty  we are not limiting ourselves to helping tofeed the poor; rather  we are committed to helping thepoor to feed themselves.For that reason food sovereignty in Venezuelaputs a clear emphasis on assisting small producersfrom community-run cooperatives. A far-reaching landreform has already transferred over 2 million hectaresof land to small producers. We have also made a firmcommitment to create a world seed bank in our countryto protect our heritage of seeds from the violentencroachments of transgenic and genetically modifiedcrops.In addition  we have recently created a Ministryof Food and Nutrition to guarantee our people theirfundamental rights in that area.Venezuela ardently supports the initiatives underway to reform the United Nations. As supporters ofmultilateralism and participatory democracy  we claima greater participation of the countries of the South atthe United Nations  and particularly in a moredemocratic Security Council  one in which there is noright of veto. In that regard  we support the candidacyof Brazil as a permanent member of an expandedCouncil.Venezuela aspires to join the Economic andSocial Council for the period 2005-2007. Our presencein the Economic and Social Council will help thepeoples of the South to promote at the global level theideas and social justice we are trying to enactdomestically. To achieve that objective and to attain theMillennium Development Goals  we believe that thecountries possessing the resources must make afinancial effort commensurate with the challenge.Venezuela has invested $2 billion in socialprogrammes this year  and we recently helped establisha fund of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC) to combat desertification anddrought  which greatly threaten our African brothers.That assistance from OPEC members reflects oursolidarity with our brothers and sisters in Africa.Venezuela has already had the opportunity to assistseveral African countries through its policy ofcooperation.The United Nations was born in a world that wastraumatized by the atrocities of Second World War  yethad the hope of creating a world of greater dignity forhuman beings.Fifty-five years later  when we observe that thewill of the General Assembly is often not respected  itappears that we have lost our course. Thus  we run therisk of submerging the world in a war of a thousandyears. It is time to put an end to the hypocrisy thatpermits a situation in which some resolutions arefollowed while others go unheeded.Let us have the courage to recover the originalgoals of the Assembly. If we are courageous  we willrecognize not only that another world is possible butthat this other world is crucial for humanity."
"185",7411,"VNM",59,2004,"At the outset allow me  on behalf of the Vietnamese delegation  towarmly congratulate you  Sir  an eminent son of Gabonand of Africa  with which Viet Nam has alwaysenjoyed warm sentiments and brotherly relations  onyour election as President of the General Assembly atits fifty-ninth session. I am confident that  under yourable guidance  this session will be crowned with finesuccess. I also take this opportunity to express our high29appreciation for the tremendous efforts andcontributions made by the previous President Mr. Julian Hunte  to the work of the fifty-eighthsession of the General Assembly.As the fifth year of the twenty-first centuryapproaches  we all cannot help asking ourselveswhether the world is a safer  fairer or — in a morecomprehensive assessment — better place for ourpeoples to live in. With all that has happened over thelast year  unfortunately  the answer cannot beaffirmative.The recent barbaric and inhuman massacre ofhostages at the school in Beslan  Russia  its scale andthe manner in which it was committed show thatterrorism has become more brutal than ever and that itis spreading to almost every corner of the world andsparing no nation. At this forum  we wish to reaffirmthe position of the Vietnamese Government denouncingevery act of terrorism. We urge the internationalcommunity to further strengthen cooperation with aview to eliminating terrorism from our civilized world.We have more than once stated our fundamentalposition that  if it is to enjoy broad support andparticipation and therefore be effective  the fightagainst terrorism must be pursued in conformity withthe provisions of the United Nations Charter and freefrom selectivity and double standards.A serious review would reveal that this is not asituation we can claim to have today. For a second timein two years  last April  in pursuit of their secessionistaim of creating a so-called independent State of Degar Kok Ksor and the organization he created  theMontagnard Foundation  staged a violent terrorist riotin the central highlands of Viet Nam  seriouslythreatening the security and territorial integrity of ourcountry. And still today  they continue to enjoyunjustified protection by certain forces.While encouraged by the trend of enhancedcooperation and friendship among countries andregions  we are equally concerned about conflicts andother threats mounting in different areas  especially inthe Middle East and Africa. The Iraqi people are yet toknow genuine peace. Non-traditional security threats such as narcotics  the spread of diseases  transnationalorganized crime and environmental degradation continue to affect adversely the life of peoples and thedevelopment of nations.The year 2005 is approaching. We are to reviewthe realization of the Millennium Development Goals.An undeniable fact is that the window of opportunityfor the economic development and integration ofdeveloping countries has become narrower  while thegap between the rich countries and the poor countriesand that between the rich and the poor within countriesare increasingly wider. According to a recent report bythe United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment  the gap between the world’s richest andpoorest countries at present is 74-fold. That being thereality  what is discouraging is that the proportion ofresources being utilized for economic development isnegatively imbalanced. Last year  for example  militaryexpenditures by rich countries amounted to more than$700 billion  which was 10 times higher than the totalamount of their official development assistance fordeveloping nations.Instead of receiving a stronger commitment todevelopment assistance  developing countries havefallen victim to unfair practices in international trade.A case in point is the application of protectionistmeasures under the form of anti-dumping dutiesimposed on Viet Nam’s catfish and shrimp  as well assimilar products of other developing countries. Theunfair imposition of anti-dumping duties on VietNam’s shrimp export by the United States has inflictedlosses on 3.5 million poor Vietnamese farmers whoearn their living directly or indirectly from the shrimpindustry. That not only runs counter to the principles ofthe World Trade Organization (WTO)  but alsoundermines the poverty-reduction efforts of theVietnamese Government  as well as the results oftechnical assistance provided by such internationalbodies as the World Bank  the International MonetaryFund  the Asian Development Bank and various UnitedNations agencies.In a world where injustice and uncertaintiesremain  it is both a desire of all nations and a primarytask of the international community to build a morepeaceful and fairer environment conducive todevelopment and prosperity. Such an environment canbe created only if all nations strictly comply with thefundamental principles of the United Nations Charterand international law  of which respect for the nationalindependence  sovereignty and territorial integrity andnon-interference in the internal affairs of nations aremost important. As the world’s largest multilateral30Organization  the United Nation is the sole entity fullycapable of creating that new environment.Viet Nam holds that  to fulfil that crucial role  theUnited Nations should be reformed in a way that willimprove its effectiveness and democracy. We highlyappreciate the ongoing efforts of the High-Level Panelon Threats  Challenges and Change and hope that thePanel will be able to put forth recommendations thatcan serve as a good basis for member States to hold in-depth discussions with a view to arriving at concretemeasures to be implemented soon  thus meeting theexpectations of the world public at large of a new effective and more democratic United Nations.In that connection  Viet Nam is of the view that if the Security Council’s democracy  effectiveness andtransparency are to be enhanced and if it is to truly acton behalf of all United Nations Members  as stated inthe Charter  both the non-permanent and the permanentmembership of the Security Council should be enlargedand developing countries more adequately representedin that important body. We wish to reiterate our supportfor Japan  Germany  India and other capable countriesfrom different continents becoming permanentmembers of the Security Council once it is enlarged.A more peaceful  fairer and more favourableenvironment for development requires internationaleconomic relations based on equality  mutual benefits shared responsibilities and the realization ofcommitments. Developed countries should seriouslyseek to fulfil their commitments to allocating 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product to officialdevelopment assistance; provide broader  faster anddeeper debt relief to poor nations; finance developmentprojects; and create fairer and more favourableconditions for developing nations to access the worldmarket and to join the WTO.Viet Nam holds that regional and interregionalcooperation and new partnerships between developedand developing countries are effective measures forputting into place fair and favourable conditions fordevelopment and for making sure that all nations willbenefit from the current process of globalization. Wewelcome the initiative on a new strategic partnershipbetween Asia and Africa that is being discussed amongcountries of the two continents. The initiative  the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development  is highlycommendable. Viet Nam attaches great importance topromoting South-South cooperation  especially withAfrican countries  as manifested in the “two plus one”formula  in which Viet Nam and an African country with the participation of the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations  cooperate inagricultural development. With a view to increasingcooperation with and assistance to developing nations we call for an end to unjust embargoes  especially theunilateral embargo against Cuba  which has been inplace for years now and caused untold difficulties andsuffering for the Cuban people.It is Viet Nam’s consistent policy to support thejust cause of the Palestinian people in the struggle fortheir inalienable rights. We call on the partiesconcerned to refrain from and cease acts of violenceand actively to participate in the implementation of theroad map for peace towards a just and lasting solutionthat takes into account the interests of the partiesconcerned for the sake of peace and stability in theMiddle East.Restoring peace and security and reconstructingIraq are pressing needs of the people of that country atpresent. Viet Nam is concerned about the escalatingviolence against innocent civilians. We hope that thesituation in Iraq will soon be stabilized so that the Iraqipeople can focus on their national reconstruction anddevelopment.The United Nations should play a more activerole in Iraq  commensurate with its mandate. Viet Namattended the conference on the reconstruction of Iraqand is willing to involve itself more actively in thatprocess.In our national reform and development processover the past 18 years  we have surmounted enormouschallenges to realize the goal of a rich people  a strongcountry  a just  democratic and civilized society.Encouraging results have been recorded. Over the past10 years  the average annual growth of our grossdomestic product has been maintained at as high as 7.4per cent  with the number of poor households reducedby half. Special importance has been given to people-centred development. We are resolved to sustain higheconomic growth in combination with the developmentof culture  the advancement of social progress andequality  the improvement of living conditions for thepeople and  most important  the achievement of thegoal of becoming an industrialized country by 2020.Given our substantial initial achievements and theappropriate path on which we have embarked  the31United Nations Development Programme  in its thirdreport on the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals in Viet Nam in 2003  assessed thatViet Nam is capable of overcoming its challenges toreach the Goals set in the Millennium Declaration. Wewish to take this opportunity to express our deepgratitude to the United Nations agencies for theireffective assistance. The United Nations agencies inViet Nam have taken important steps to furtherenhance cooperation effectiveness  especially thosewithin the United Nations Development AssistanceFramework. We are committed to continuing to workwith them in striving for the achievement of theMillennium Development Goals.In its reform process  Viet Nam pursues a foreignpolicy of openness  independence  sovereignty and thediversification and multilateralization of relations  andis willing to be a friend to and reliable partner of allcountries striving for independence  peace development and cooperation. Increasing regional andinterregional cooperation is a consistent policy and aninseparable component of the VietnameseGovernment’s policy towards greater internationalintegration. Viet Nam is actively participating ineconomic cooperation activities within the frameworksof the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  theAsia-Pacific Conference on Electron Microscopy andthe Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN).Within ASEAN  Viet Nam works closely withother ASEAN countries to promote regionalcooperation through such initiatives as the creation ofthe ASEAN security community  the ASEAN economiccommunity and the ASEAN socio-cultural community the Initiative for ASEAN Integration  the initiative onsub-Mekong regional cooperation  and developmenttriangles. ASEAN attaches great importance topromoting its relationship with dialogue partners.Active steps are being taken to establish free-tradeareas between ASEAN and China  Japan and theRepublic of Korea  and to promote closer economicpartnership with the United States  the EuropeanUnion  Russia and India  including free-trade areas.Viet Nam believes that multifaceted cooperation inSouth-East Asia will make important contributions tobuilding a peaceful  fair and favourable environmentfor regional countries.As evidence of its determination to participatemore actively in international and interregionalcooperation frameworks  Viet Nam is going to host theFifth Asia-Europe Summit in Hanoi this October andthe APEC Summit in 2006. We are standing forelection to a non-permanent seat in the SecurityCouncil for the term 2008-2009. In undertaking thoseimportant efforts  we look forward to enjoying thecontinued support and cooperation of the internationalcommunity.Our global village longs for a more peaceful stable and favourable environment for developmentand shared prosperity. Striving together  we will turnthat dream into reality."
"186",7442,"VUT",59,2004,"I bring to thisgathering a warm greeting from the people of theRepublic of Vanuatu.Mr. President  at the outset  I take thisopportunity to congratulate you on your assumption ofthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session. I also take this occasion to acknowledgewith deep gratitude the contributions of yourpredecessor  who so competently steered the work ofthe fifty-eighth session to its conclusion.Here  I must also acknowledge the outstandingrole of Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who has beenresolute in his efforts to revitalize the Organization’sability to address global concerns. My delegationreaffirms its support for Mr. Annan’s profound andmeticulous leadership of the United Nations.I also take this opportunity to convey thecondolences of my Government and the people ofVanuatu to the people of the Caribbean nations  inparticular Haiti  for the loss of so many lives and forthe extensive damage caused by the destructive forcesof nature that recently swept through the region. Weoffer them our moral support and pray that the affectedpeoples will soon recover and that the devastated areasof their nations will be swiftly rehabilitated and rebuilt.Those inevitable natural calamities demonstrate oncemore the extreme and particular vulnerability of islandStates  which seriously affects national economies.Every year  from this rostrum  we reaffirm ourfaith and confidence in upholding the purposes andprinciples of the Charter. We entered the newmillennium with much anticipation and hope ofcreating a just and better world for all our citizens.However  global insecurity and the varying dimensionsof serious conflict have created a frightening situation.It is to be expected that the world will plunge intofurther turmoil unless the role of the United Nations —the only truly global body — is reinvigorated andrecovers its legitimate responsibility of addressing thecauses of conflict and maintaining peace and security. Icome to the Assembly with some trepidation  as I seeour world spiralling out of control unless its Membersuphold the universality of the United Nations decision-making process in addressing global concerns.The world is at a crossroads and we meet here ata critical juncture. Around us  civil strife  wars poverty  disease  famine  drought  natural disasters terrorism  environmental degradation  depletion of landand marine resources and other phenomena areravaging the world. The displacement of peoples fromtheir natural habitats and the sacrilege of humansuffering in many parts of the world demonstrate that25unless immediate remedial strategies are implemented the global situation will continue to deteriorate.Moreover  the emergence of conflict in areas weonce believed stable  the deterioration of law and orderand the senseless killing of innocent peoples arepainful reminders that we need to rethink our policiesand decisions. Globalization has brought with it bothopportunities and challenges  but for the small islandStates the challenges are much more ominous. Thoseare the realities.Those negative developments lead me toconclude that the United Nations is indispensable andthat we all need to work as friends and equal partners.Globalization has brought nations together. We areinterlinked and interdependent. That demands globalcooperation and governance from all responsibleMembers of the Organization. Understandably  thereare the vested interests of the powerful  but that onlynecessitates genuine cooperation and goodwill toachieve convergence of those interests. The UnitedNations role in that regard must remain fundamental inorder to ensure compatibility with the internationallegal framework. Maverick policies and decisions willonly create further divisions and hostility.With that in mind  I believe there is nowconsensus on introducing far-reaching reforms thatmake the United Nations relevant for all its Members with the fundamental objective of preservinginternational peace  security and stability.My Government fully supports efforts to reformthe United Nations system in order to ensure a strongerand more effective Organization. On that note  mydelegation endorses the view of other delegations onthe need to review the membership of the SecurityCouncil so that it will better reflect geographicaldistribution and the underrepresented groups ofMember countries of the United Nations  withoutaffecting the authority of the Council.I hope all the rhetoric that has come before theAssembly can be translated into concrete and practicalaction. We must be resolute in our collective desire towork together as sovereign nations in addressing theworld’s problems through multilateral institutions. Theblueprint for international cooperation has beenestablished  but reforming certain structures in theUnited Nations system must be seen as a prerequisite ifwe are serious about moving forward. The Achillesheel of the current structure is the imbalance of powerin the United Nations system. It has become so chronicthat it has weakened the multilateral focus cohesiveness and internationalism of the UnitedNations.The principles of democratization and goodgovernance so actively advocated and championed bysome Members must be reflected in the reorganizationand decision-making process of the United Nationssystem.It is in this regard that Vanuatu supports thereview of the permanent membership of the SecurityCouncil in order to include Japan and onerepresentative each from the African continent  theMiddle East and the group of small developingcountries. A more representative Council will bringabout openness and transparency  create confidenceand ameliorate understanding and cooperation. Arestructuring of the membership of the SecurityCouncil is long overdue. Diversity is essential there.My Government looks forward to the report ofthe Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Threats Challenges and Threats.Although the fight against terrorism takes centrestage  it must not overshadow the socio-economicdevelopment agenda and other serious securityconcerns affecting the developing world  and inparticular small island States. Resources will inevitablybe diverted towards combating terrorism in all itsfacets  but judicious decisions need to be taken. It isagainst that background that our delegation wishes toassociate itself with statements made by otherdelegations on the imperativeness of supporting thedevelopment constraints of developing nations  and inparticular the concerns of the small island States onvulnerability.At the Millennium Summit leaders adopted theeight Millennium Development Goals  with targets tobe achieved by 2015. Although commitments havebeen made  the lethargic performance of manycountries  including Vanuatu  demonstrate the need formore international support in assisting countries tomeet those targets.The global economic situation todaydiscriminates against many developing economies.Unfair trading practices and the imposition of intrusivepolicies on national economies — including that ofVanuatu — affect those economies by opening them upto unfavourable conditions that only favour strongernations. The post-Cancún period poses extremechallenges to the economic survival and socio-26economic stability of many small developing nationslike Vanuatu.My Government’s initial focus is on the socialsector  namely  on health and education. TheGovernment’s prioritized action agenda  which waslaunched last year in consultation with ourdevelopment partners  is the catalyst for Vanuatu’smedium- to long-term strategic planning. Thisdevelopment policy framework is consistent withachieving the targets of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals and emphasizes the need to empower our ruralpopulation through infrastructure- and capacity-building initiatives. We appeal to our developmentpartners to adequately assist us in its implementation.On that note  my delegation wishes to express itsgratitude to the United States of America for grantingVanuatu eligibility to access development funding fromthe Millennium Challenge Account.The primary responsibility for development lieswith a State itself. Yet  external influences andconditional aid have not adequately corresponded withVanuatu’s development priorities and achievements.The pretext for meting out foreign advice conditionedwith development assistance has been to improvegovernance and other sectors considered vital inestablishing a strong economy. In Vanuatu’s case thatline of argument has not produced tangible results with restricted progress being reflected in ourcontinuous struggle with reforms that are more or lessdictated by external forces.Both the recipient and the external assistancemust be balanced and sensitive to national interests.Too often  that normal reaction is misunderstood bysome of our development partners. From Vanuatu’sperspective  externally driven reforms must bebuttressed by an equal partnership that respects localtradition  culture and the rights of all citizens withoutdisturbing the essential uniting mechanisms of societythat have successfully held us together over time. Anexploitative agenda can only erode and dismantle thoseingrained mechanisms  leaving us vulnerable to therapid changes affecting all of us today. Vanuatuembraces democracy and the concepts of governanceand transparency  but they must be tailored to suit thetraditional system without affecting the relevance andsignificance of those far-reaching principles.In recent times  the history of the Organizationhas been characterized by indecision  which blemishesthe record of the United Nations. I speak about thelongstanding issue of self-determination  and inparticular the case of West Papua  and I do so whilebeing cognizant of the Charter and while espousing theprinciples that continue to guide the Organization’sefforts in the process of self-determination. The UnitedNations must be consistent in its decisions for therecognition and respect of the fundamental rights toself-determination for the people of West Papua. Thetruth surrounding the so-called Act of Free Choicemust be exposed to the Melanesian sisters and brothersof West Papua and the rest of the internationalcommunity. Saddest of all is General Assemblyresolution 2504 (XXIV) of 1969  concerning WestPapua. How can the United Nations continue to ignorethe cries of over 3 million people demanding justice?As world leaders  we have time and again expressedserious concerns and dissatisfaction about the fact thatcertain decisions and actions by the United Nations orits bodies were not consistent with the purposes andintentions of the Charter. However  in the case of WestPapua  absolutely nothing has been done to rectify thegross violation of internationally accepted practice. Itis therefore our joint responsibility to address this greyarea of history.The continuing disputes and concerns raised withregard to the legality of United Nations-endorsedinstruments that have been concluded throughout theyears — such as the New York Agreement of 1962  togovern the United Nations administration of the so-called Act of Free Choice in West Papua — is a clearexample challenging the integrity and validity ofUnited Nations resolutions at that time. In our opinion the United Nations-conducted exercises were a totalfarce conditioned only to suit the geopolitical climateof that period. The United Nations cannot  and mustnot  continue to turn a blind eye to its own pastfailures. It is morally  politically and legally wrong todo so. The Netherlands in particular  which was theformer colonial authority  should also recognize that itshould shoulder some responsibility in helping toresolve the unfortunate situation of West Papua in apeaceful and transparent manner. Why is no oneaccountable for those unjust decisions affecting thelives of millions of people today?Vanuatu therefore calls for the establishment of aspecial commission of inquiry to review the UnitedNations conduct in relation to the 1969 Act. We alsocall for the United Nations to send a fact-findingmission to examine the situation in West Papua withregard to human rights abuses and other related issues.And we call for the reinscription of West Papua on the27list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. Those arecritically challenging responsibilities.On a final matter  my delegation stronglyreaffirms its support for resolution 2758 (XXVI) which was adopted during the twenty-sixth session  in1971  and which recognized the legal and politicalrepresentation of the People’s Republic of China as aMember of the United Nations. Vanuatu againreiterates its unwavering support for one China andurges all members of the United Nations to work in theinterests of world peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.In conclusion  I must bring to the attention of theAssembly another priority issue that is of graveimportance to my Government and nation. I wouldonce again like to raise the matter of the relocation ofthe Pacific Operations Centre of the Economic andSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)from Vanuatu to another location. My Government wasnot properly consulted in that regard  and requests thatthe decision to relocate the Centre from Vanuatu bereconsidered. If the Centre’s relevance in the region isbeing questioned  then my Government would proposethat a proper review be carried out with a view torestructuring the ESCAP office in order to relocate thePacific Operations Centre to Bangkok. Programmesand activities under ESCAP responsibility may bebetter coordinated through the United NationsDevelopment Programme activities in the region.I hope that wisdom will prevail as the debatecontinues on our future destiny. Despite all ourdifferences and diversity  human security for all is ourmain goal. That should remain the focus of the UnitedNations agenda. The cardinal question is whetherMembers will allow the United Nations to undertakeserious reforms in meeting the challenges ahead. Thefuture remains in our hands."
"187",7474,"WSM",59,2004,"Samoa warmlycongratulates you  Mr. President  on your election tosteer the course of the Organization’s work at thiscritical time in its 59-year history. I know that you willcontinue the good work of your predecessor inhighlighting the multidimensional nature ofinternational security and the need to reform the UnitedNations so that our Organization responds moreeffectively to the current and emerging challengesfacing our world.Hardly a week goes by without an act ofterrorism somewhere in the world assailing our senses.Such murderous acts  regardless of the cause orgrievance advanced by their perpetrators  are utterlyindefensible. Many innocent lives continue to bewasted  with people killed or maimed and multitudesdisplaced by heinous acts designed to undermine anddestabilize the collective efforts of the internationalcommunity to achieve peace and security for oursocieties. Samoa condemns  in the strongest terms  allacts of terrorism and will continue to take actions andcontribute our support to the campaign against it.Besides terrorism  other scourges to world peaceand to the stability of our nations persist. The threat ofweapons of mass destruction  poverty and hunger environmental degradation  the trafficking andsmuggling of human beings  HIV/AIDS  malaria andtuberculosis are becoming perennial major threats toglobal security.The campaign against terrorism can still besuccessful  but not merely by force of arms. Preventingsafe havens for terrorists and closing off their sourcesof financing are just as crucial. But no less important isthe necessity of addressing the root causes that feedterrorism.No sensible administration can fail to be movedby the tragedy of Beslan and the humanitariancatastrophe of Darfur. The imperatives for action bythe Organization and the international community toaddress those events and their causes have beeneloquently articulated by leaders who have spokenearlier from this rostrum. I wish only to recall andemphasize that actions to arrive at solutions to thoseevents and others like them must be carried out inaccordance with the rule of law.With regard to Iraq  Samoa deplores the dailyviolence that has killed and maimed so many peopleand the circumstances that have brought it about. Wefully support the re-establishment of Iraq’s sovereignty and we pray for the success of a credible electionprocess to create an Iraqi Government with a popularmandate.Likewise  we can only pray and hope that aworkable solution will be found soon for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  before many more lives are lost onboth sides.Last month  Samoa hosted  in the capital  Apia the annual Pacific Islands Forum Summit of leaders.As the representative holding the current chairmanshipof that group  I wish to inform the Assembly that thePacific leaders again noted the dangers to the world ofterrorism  and — to the Pacific region  in particular —of transnational crime  illicit drugs and the spread ofsmall arms assault weapons. Consequently  the PacificIslands Forum countries have strengthened theircooperation in counter-terrorism measures  as well asemphasized national efforts and regional cooperation incombating transnational organized crime and inbuilding border-control capacities.The Pacific Islands Forum is also committed tocollective arrangements and mechanisms to assistregional Governments to recover from nationalconflicts and crises. The success of these arrangements undertaken with the support of the United Nations  isalready evident in the positive results of the RegionalAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands. While muchmore remains to be done  Solomon Islands is makinggood and steady progress  and the Forum will remainengaged in sustaining the mission.Similarly  peace has been achieved inBougainville  with elections for an autonomousBougainville Government to be held by the end of theyear. The roles of the Governments of Papua NewGuinea  Australia and New Zealand  with the supportof the Pacific Islands Forum  working together with the5United Nations Observer Mission  is critical in guidingBougainville during this important period.An important feature of the response mechanismput in place by the Pacific Islands Forum to assistregional Governments is its flexibility. The PacificIslands Forum is now in the process of responding to acrisis in one of our member countries resulting fromcauses quite different from those in Solomon Islandsand Bougainville.In recognition of the importance of goodgovernance for economic growth and sustainabledevelopment  the Pacific Islands Forum has invited itsmembers to become parties to the United NationsConvention against Corruption. In strengtheningfurther the institutions of good governance in Pacificnations  the important role of non-State actors and civilsociety was highlighted by the Pacific leaders.One issue that the Pacific islands have brought tothe attention of the United Nations over the years thatremains relevant — not only for the Pacific — andthat  very importantly  is advancing the cause ofnuclear non-proliferation  is that of the South PacificNuclear-Free-Zone Treaty. The Pacific Forum hasagain called on the United States to ratify the Protocolsto the Treaty.Although the Pacific Islands Forum has beenheavily engaged in overcoming crises with which someof the regional Governments are grappling  severalPacific island nations  in addition to Australia and NewZealand  have nevertheless been contributing in wayswe can to the United Nations peacekeeping efforts. Asfor my own country  we provide police to the UnitedNations peacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste andLiberia  in addition to those we have committed toSolomon Islands.Clearly  our small nations are trying hard tocontribute to the security and peace initiatives of theUnited Nations. However  national obligations —including reporting obligations for the variousconventions and United Nations resolutions on securityand terrorism — place an onerous burden on theinfrastructure and administrative capacity of smallStates. We therefore seek the understanding of theOrganization and encourage the appropriate UnitedNations bodies to explore innovative ways to helpsmall States meet their commitments.Mr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda)  Vice-President  took the Chair.The challenges to and special needs of smallisland developing States are well known  and arereflected in the Barbados Programme of Action for theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  which has been in place for the past 10 years.Sadly  despite the commitments made 10 years ago atBarbados and during the 1999 mid-term review in thisHall  the achievement of those goals continues to eludeus.It is our fervent hope  however  that theInternational Meeting due to take place in Mauritiusnext January to comprehensively review the BarbadosProgramme of Action will provide an opportunity forthe international community to demonstrate thepolitical will and commit sufficient resources to allowour small island developing nations to overcome theunique challenges we face.The series of hurricanes that wrought massivedevastation in some island nations of the Caribbeanand in the United States is a stark reminder of theextreme challenges faced by small island developingStates and of their vulnerability to disasters. OurPacific island nations  including my own country know from our bitter experience of cyclones thatregularly batter our region about the dishearteningeffect of such disasters in setting back  in a matter ofhours  the hard-earned development achievements ofmany years.The concerns and the vulnerability of our nationsare therefore quite real. While we accept the primaryresponsibility for achieving the goals of theProgramme of Action  the reality is that the support ofthe international community is indispensable to itssuccess. We therefore call on the United Nationssystem and the international community to provide thenecessary support to complement ongoing and futureprogrammes  as well as for the implementation andmonitoring of the Mauritius outcomes for thesustainable development of small island developingStates.Likewise  the importance of multilateralinstitutions such as the Global Environment Facility(GEF) in this process cannot be overemphasized. Wetherefore urge GEF to apply its rules of access and tosimplify its disbursement procedures in order to take6into account the special circumstances of small islanddeveloping States.Trade is a vital component of sustainabledevelopment  especially for small island developingStates. We therefore continue to urge that thevulnerabilities of small States be taken fully intoaccount in the World Trade Organization negotiations particularly with regard to special and differentialtreatment for small economies.The review of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals next year will provide an opportunity for theinternational community to take stock of progress andto identify remedial strategies and commitments for thefurther realization of those Goals. Samoa remainscommitted to the achievement of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.The election of the second Deputy Prosecutor ofthe International Criminal Court just two weeks agocompletes the process of the full institutionalization ofthe Court. Samoa warmly welcomes the broadcomplement of judges and officers of the Court andadds its voice in urging other United Nations Membersto accede to the Rome Statute for the establishment ofthe Court. Given its role in upholding internationalhumanitarian standards and in protecting human rights the Court deserves the support of the internationalcommunity to give it the full universality it requires.We thank the Secretary-General and the previousPresident of the Assembly for their very commendablework in advancing the revitalization and reform of theOrganization.To this end  Samoa fully supports the work of theHigh-level Panel on Threats  Challenges and Change and looks forward to its report at the end of the year.We believe that the outcome of United Nationsreform should include the restoration of the primacy ofthe role of the General Assembly and the attainment ofa more effective and efficient Secretariat.In particular  we support the enlargement of theSecurity Council and strongly recommend theinclusion of Japan and Germany as permanentmembers.Finally  I offer Mr. Ping my delegation’s fullsupport in the discharge of his numerousresponsibilities  and I wish him well in his presidency."
"188",7520,"YEM",59,2004,"It givesme pleasure to begin my remarks by congratulatingMr. Ping on the vote of confidence represented by hiselection as President of the current session of theAssembly. Given his wisdom and organizational skills I am confident that he will be able to lead ourdeliberations successfully. Thus  his positive input willfurther enhance the stature and effectiveness of theUnited Nations at a time of profound andunprecedented transformation on the world scene.I wish also to commend the efforts and wisdom ofhis predecessor for his remarkable stewardship.Furthermore  Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General deserves our gratitude for his persistent efforts to liveup to the demands of his office in the face of complexand daunting challenges and surprises.Undoubtedly  the events of the past two years —specifically from the period prior to and after theoccupation of Iraq — have shown clearly that  intoday’s world  unilateralism in determininginternational action inevitably leads to the proliferationof hotbeds of tension  in addition to jeopardizinginternational peace and security. At the same time those events have further demonstrated the relevanceof multilateralism in global decision-making throughinternational institutions  especially this world body.Given that the United Nations represents asuperior form of multilateralism  because it bringstogether Member States to address common concernsover the maintenance of collective security and to faceuniversal challenges  it is only logical that we allshould join together to protect it againstmarginalization and to safeguard and strengthen itsrole. Thus  we should not allow the will of one Power or of a certain group of Powers  to direct the actions ofthe United Nations system or permit it to be used toadvance their agenda without regard for the wishes andinterests of the rest of the membership.A case in point  in our view  is the need toreconsider the decision-making process in the SecurityCouncil  its composition and membership. The realitiesof our contemporary world and the imperatives of38global security  which is indivisible  must be fullytaken into consideration in any review exercise. Nosingle State or group of States can alone guaranteeglobal security or assume the responsibility of thatundertaking without active participation by otherStates. In addition  decisions that are not in line withinternational law  the Charter of the United Nations orthe view of the majority of the membership should bevehemently opposed.As this session coincides with the thirdanniversary of the 11 September tragedy  once againthe Republic of Yemen reaffirms its commitment tofight extremism and terrorism within the frameworkestablished and led by the United Nations. Yemen  forits part  has made great progress in combatingterrorism and terrorists. The most recent achievementinvolved defeating a group that had rebelled against theConstitution and the rule of law in the Sa’dah region inYemen. Those rebels had resorted to terrorism in orderto achieve their goals. Their terrorist acts harmedinnocent civilians and disrupted security and stabilityin the area.The Government of Yemen  while fullyresponsible for the safety and security of its citizensand the homeland  remains faithful to its internationalcommitment to combat terrorism. Our conviction isthat terrorism has no specific identity or particularreligion. The struggle for national liberation or to endforeign occupation is a legitimate right under theCharter of the United Nations  international law andthe basic principles of justice and human rights. Such astruggle can therefore not be treated as terrorism. Inaddition  Yemen’s experience in combating terrorismhas taught us that in order effectively to battleterrorism  all possible resources must be deployed including its root causes  dialogue  the promotion ofdevelopment and justice  in addition to good securityand intelligence work.Yemen is a strong believer in the United Nations.However  we believe that  despite all the efforts madeby the dynamic Secretariat of this great institution  thegaps between rich and poor countries are widening.That is partly due to current economic policies thatstrengthen the dominance of wealthy nations over poorcountries. Today more than ever we need to examine inearnest the imbalances in international economicrelations.The first step we expect in this regard is thefulfilment by wealthier nations of the pledges andundertakings announced in their initiatives forachieving economic balance between the rich and thepoor. Failure to do so  as I presume all of us recognize would deepen the sense of bitterness felt by the poorcountries. It might also breed extremism and violenceto which no country would be immune.In that context  the Government of the Republicof Yemen believes that the recognition by the leadersof the Group of Eight industrial nations that theconsolidation of peace in the Middle East and thepromotion of economic growth and politicaldevelopment through a process of overall developmentin all countries of the region — as outlined in the G-8declaration adopted at their most recent Summit in SeaIsland  Georgia  United States — represents a verysignificant statement and a positive strategic challengeof interest to us and to the international community ingeneral.It is indeed a challenge  because this long-overdue vision seeks to correct a chronic anomaly. It isalso a challenge because of its positive implicationsand the shift in focus it can bring in favour of globalstability and international peace and security once thatabstract concept is translated into concrete andmeaningful steps on the ground. That will requiregenuine partnerships and the abandoning of policies ofcoercion.Proceeding from these convictions  Yemenwelcomed that initiative and agreed to participate inthe G-8 Sea Island Summit for two reasons: first because that vision is in line with our national plan forreform  and  secondly  because we welcome anypartnership between Arab States  the European Union the United States of America and the world at largethat enhances our development and stability andcontributes to the fight against terrorism.The commitment of my Government to build abetter future for the people of Yemen and the people ofour region has prompted us to institute numerouseconomic and political reforms  broaden popularinvolvement in governance  and strengthen ourpartnership with other countries and entities.This was highlighted in the Sana’a Declaration onDemocracy  Human Rights and the Role of theInternational Criminal Court  adopted earlier this yearat the Sana’a Intergovernmental Regional Conference.39A number of other countries  represented by theirGovernments  Parliaments and civil society  regionaland international organizations  took part in that forum.The Forum was organized in response to reforminitiatives that came from the Governments andpeoples of the region. It stressed that good democraticgovernance and respect for human rights require fullmobilization of the energies and potential of civilsociety. They also require interaction among allstakeholders  with a sense of responsibility andpartnership with Governments  and support fromoutside the region  in order to use overall developmentas a vehicle towards stability  progress and movementon the road towards democracy and overall humandevelopment.No one can ignore the great achievements madeby our Organization in promoting peace  security andwelfare over the course of its rich history. But oneshould  by the same token  admit that it has failed toresolve numerous conflicts that have endangered  andcontinue to endanger  the security and stability of manynations and peoples. Foremost among these dangers isthe Arab-Israeli conflict. Certainly  the United Nationshas failed to put an end to ongoing Israeli aggressionagainst the Palestinian people and to Israel’s repeatedthreats against Arab countries. Also  there are manytrouble spots and areas of conflict across the globe thatthe United Nations must address effectively if we wantinternational peace and security to prevail.The position of the Republic of Yemen regardingthe question of Palestine is abundantly clear. It is basedon the principles laid out by the Quartet in the roadmap  and on those contained in the Arab PeaceInitiative. This Initiative calls for the establishment ofa State of Palestine with full sovereignty over itsterritory and with Jerusalem as its capital; Israel’swithdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since4 June 1967; and the return of refugees to their homes.All along  Yemen has maintained that peace inthe Middle East will elude us as long as Israel isallowed to manoeuvre and circumvent United Nationsresolutions. We also believe that Israel will not acceptthe aforesaid solutions unless a Security Councilresolution is adopted with a view to imposing asolution on Israel that includes an enforcementmechanism. Contrary to our hopes  the entire questionhas become even more intractable and difficult tocomprehend  especially given the use of the veto poweragainst any proposed resolution that would force Israelto implement United Nations resolutions. This hasencouraged Israel to persist in constructing theracially-based separation wall  which aggravates thesuffering of the Palestinian people and is taking awaysizeable tracts of their remaining land  in defiance ofglobal consensus and of the advisory opinion of theInternational Court of Justice (ICJ).We wish to emphasize here that  as recent eventshave demonstrated  the wall cannot guarantee securityto Israel. Israel’s genuine security could be achieved ifit were to accept the road map and commit itself toimplementing relevant United Nations resolutions.We demand that the Security Council ensure thephysical safety of the Palestinian President  YasserArafat  provide protection for the Palestinian peopleagainst Israeli state-sponsored terrorism  and showrespect for the wishes and the will of the Palestinianpeople.In addition  Israeli withdrawal from the occupiedSyrian and Lebanese territories is an integral part ofany Middle East peace initiative. I wish to recall in thisregard that the Arab Peace Initiative represents an Arabconsensus for the resolution of the Arab-Israeliconflict.Furthermore  my Government considersinadmissible the threats that the Israeli militarymachine fires against sister Syria and against Iran fromtime to time. This represents irresponsible provocationthat exacerbates the already tense situation in theregion. The timing of these threats further fuelsviolence and frustrates peace endeavours aimed atfinding a just and negotiated settlement of theArab-Israeli conflict. They also represent an attempt bythe Israeli Government to distract attention from itsfailure to ensure security for its citizens. The time hascome for Israel to recognize that its stability andacceptance by countries of the region will remainunfulfilled unless it implements the road map andrelevant United Nations resolutions  and withdrawsfrom the occupied Arab territories in Palestine  theGolan and the Shab’a farms.In the same context  I wish to affirm my country’ssupport for United Nations efforts regarding theconvening of a disarmament conference which aims inter alia  at the establishment of the Middle Eastregion as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction.To this end  Israel must accede to the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty.40The current violence in Iraq  and the violation ofhuman rights and bloodshed of our Iraqi brothers is aninevitable outcome of an invasion. Thus  it isincumbent upon the United Nations to fulfil its role  asset forth in relevant resolutions  regarding the need toprovide support to Iraq with a view to restoring peaceand stability throughout the country. The interim IraqiGovernment should be empowered to exercise fullsovereignty in order to lead Iraq towards holdingdemocratic elections and forming a constitutionalGovernment that represents the will of the Iraqi people restores law and order and puts an end to theoccupation of the country. The tragic situationunfolding today in Iraq  in the wake of the downfall ofSaddam Hussein’s regime  has resulted in terrorism violations and chaos  which all of us can see. Thatsituation may take Iraq down a slippery slope ofsectarian violence and conflict which  in turn  willthreaten the unity and future of Iraq.Yemen believes that all of us should assist andsupport the interim Government in Iraq and thenational and legislative councils to overcome thecurrent critical transitional stage in accordance withSecurity Council resolution 1546 (2004)  with a viewtoward safeguarding the sovereignty  independence andterritorial integrity of Iraq. Also  we must ensure thatthe forthcoming period leading to parliamentaryelections and the formation of a national Governmentwill reflect the will of the Iraqi people without externalinterference. All effort should be made to develop anddefine political solutions for the complex situation  andto provide to the interim Government all it may need inorder to achieve a successful outcome. Priority shouldbe given to enabling the Iraqi Government to start theprocess of national reconciliation  ensuring theparticipation of all factions and political groups indefining the future of Iraq and closing the annals of thepast. We also call for an end to violence againstcivilians  as well as excessive military reactions by theoccupation forces  which victimize innocent civiliansand lead to further destruction  pushing moderatestowards extremism.In view of Yemen’s sense of fraternalresponsibility towards Iraq  we submitted to the lastArab summit in Tunis  an initiative conceived on thebasis of a set of firm principles set forth in UnitedNations resolutions. In essence  the initiative containedguiding principles for assisting the brotherly people ofIraq to overcome their current crisis. It also called forsetting timelines to link efforts to restore security andstability with ending of the occupation. In themeantime  Yemen supports any Arab or internationalendeavour that might help Iraq move safely to achievepeace  stability and national unity.My country believes that national reconciliationbased on dialogue and national unity is a viable pathtoward settling the long-running dispute and conflict inSomalia. Therefore  we congratulate the Somali leaderson the progress they have so far achieved within theframework of the reconciliation process. At the sametime  we call upon all warring factions in Somalia tobuild on that success and to put the highest nationalinterests of Somalia ahead of their own agendas.Yemen  which has played a leading role in promotingnational reconciliation in Somalia  calls upon theUnited Nations and the international community toassume fully and effectively their responsibilities inorder to bring about peace and security in Somalia.The Yemeni Government appreciates the currentefforts being made to assist the national reconciliationtalks in Somalia to reach a successful outcome  that isthe formation of a consultative council  election of aPresident for the country  and formation of an interimGovernment that will lead Somalia towards drafting anew constitution and setting up a democratic system ofgovernment. Yemen  of course  will align itself withthe good offices of the Governments of Djibouti Ethiopia and Kenya  and supported by the EuropeanUnion and the United States  to promote reconciliation.The Republic of Yemen has been closelyfollowing the humanitarian situation in the Darfurprovince of sisterly Sudan. I wish to underline here thedecisions adopted by the Council of Arab ForeignMinisters  which met at the headquarters of the ArabLeague early last August. That meeting was alsoattended by the head of the African Union Commissionand the Foreign Minister of Nigeria representingPresident Obasanjo of Nigeria — the current Chairmanof the African Union. We wish also to reaffirm thedecisions adopted in this regard by the Council of ArabForeign Ministers in its regular session on 14 and15 September. Those decisions reflected the jointArab-African position regarding the situation in Darfur.They affirmed the need to address the matter within theAfrican Arab framework. They also rejected allattempts to create a rift in Arab-African relations andstressed that there was no hard evidence of genocide.Furthermore  the meeting underlined the responsibility41of the Government of the Sudan for maintainingsecurity and stability  providing protection for itscitizens and disarming all militias in the region. Thesuccess of the Sudanese Government in achievingthose goals will depend on the degree of internationalsupport and humanitarian relief assistance provided toit. All external parties must also refrain frominterfering in the internal affairs of the Sudan.The Government of the Sudan must assume itsresponsibility for deploying its forces so as to ensuresecurity  provide protection for all of its citizens andconfront all of the armed groups responsible for thecrisis. In the meantime  all the logistical supportneeded by the Government of Sudan should beprovided by the African Union and Arab States with aview to achieving those objectives.The Sudan’s response to relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions  including the steps it has begun totake  clearly demonstrate its genuine commitment to itsundertakings. Furthermore  we call on the UnitedNations  especially the Security Council  to address theissue on the basis of an accurate assessment of thesituation in Darfur which obviously has begun toimprove. We must avoid favouring one side at theexpense of the other. We should also shift our focus toaddress the humanitarian situation without regard topolitical considerations or motives. All of the parties tothe Darfur dispute  including the Government of theSudan  should be urged to participate constructivelyand unconditionally in peace talks  with a view toachieving a just solution to the crisis. Any attempt touse blackmail or to exploit events to the advantage ofthe rebel groups must be rejected. Any party thatviolates its commitments  as verified by a neutralsecurity monitoring mechanism  should be heldaccountable.The Government of the Republic of Yemenstresses that threatening or imposing a unilateralboycott or economic sanctions  as practised againstsome Member States  would constitute an explicitviolation of the principles of international law —regardless of the fact that such practices have failed onthe ground in more than one case. Indeed  sanctionsand boycotts aggravate the suffering of innocentcivilians and lead to the escalation of hostilities.My country supports the call by the UnitedNations to end unilateral measures  and it affirms theneed to promote a culture of dialogue andunderstanding  even when dealing with controversialissues. That should  indeed  be the rational andcivilized approach that all of us should pursue inresolving our disputes and mending our relationships.Finally  my delegation wishes the GeneralAssembly every success as it endeavours to fulfil itsmandate during this session  with a view to reinforcingour common action to promote peace  security andwelfare for all. It is our hope that the ongoing reformof the United Nations will achieve the long-awaitedobjectives  including equitable representation in theSecurity Council. That would enhance the Council’seffectiveness and credibility and enable it to adaptbetter to the constantly changing landscape ofinternational relations.I take this opportunity to reaffirm that theRepublic of Yemen will support any efforts aimed atstrengthening the role of the United Nations andenhancing its credibility  safeguarding the sovereigntyand will of its Member States and pooling our energiesto create a better future for humankind."
"189",7558,"YUG",59,2004,"Allow me at the outset to convey the greetings and bestwishes of the people of my country to Member Statesand their people  and to the Secretary-General.War  oppression  crime  hatred and sufferingplague hundreds of millions of men and women allover the world today. In pursuit of the ideals of peace democracy and happiness  the United Nations is theunited conscience of humankind. In order to achievethe goals of the Millennium Declaration  ourOrganization must be strengthened structurally economically and spiritually.Serbia and Montenegro therefore supports boththe initiatives for the enlargement of the SecurityCouncil  that based on the need for equalrepresentation of all continents  and that whichconcedes a special role for the most developedcountries  without whose support the United Nationswould be unable to fulfill its noble goals.The fight against global terrorism in all itsmanifestations  such as anti-Semitism and anti-Islamism  is our primary responsibility today. Thosewho perpetrated  masterminded and bankrolled terroristatrocities in New York  Washington  Moscow  Beslan Jerusalem  Madrid  Istanbul and other places have notonly declared war against all nations  but also againstGod himself  who is the same God for all people.In the fight against terrorism  force isunavoidable  but prevention is what we need most.52Politicians  international religious and spiritual leadersand the media must constantly emphasize that thekilling of children and of innocent civilians are crimesthat the terrorists are perpetrating against their ownreligions and nations and that God will neither forgivethem nor reward them with paradise for such crimes.Multilateralism is the only means to prevent thecatastrophe of the clash between faiths andcivilizations. At the same time  terrorism must becondemned with equal resolve by everyone. There canbe no acceptable terrorists  nor should terrorists beproclaimed as `freedom fighters’ anywhere.Serbia and Montenegro is a small country that hasbeen confronted with most of the world’s currentproblems and misfortunes. The recent wars that saw thebreak-up of Yugoslavia - one of the founding membersof the United Nations - have had immense and painfulconsequences: unemployment; poverty; the tragicplight of some 600 000 refugees; hopelessness amongyoung people  which breeds drug dependence; a risingsuicide rate; and the desperate position of Serbs inKosovo and Metohija.The reality of Kosovo and Metohija today is bothdramatic and grim. Over the past five years  theinternational administration and dominance of theAlbanian majority of this Serbian province have led tothe killing or abduction of more than 2 500 Serbs including many children  and to the destruction of1 500-year-old churches and monasteries andapproximately 40 000 homes. As a result of terrorismand massive violations of basic human rights  nearly200 000 Serbs and other non-Albanians have beenexpelled from Kosovo and Metohija.The hopes of suffering victims are directedtowards the United Nations  particularly its bodies andspecialized agencies. I take this opportunity to expressmy most profound gratitude to the Secretary-Generaland to the Director-General of UNESCO for thedecision to convene  in November  an internationaldonor conference aimed at funding the reconstructionof destroyed churches and monasteries in Kosovo. Weare also grateful for the principled position that allhomes must be rebuilt  that conditions must be createdfor the return of all of those who have been expelledand that the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija must beguaranteed the right to life and to freedom ofmovement and all civil  national and religious freedoms.The spirit of a united Europe and a united worldlives in the hearts of Serbs and Montenegrins. Whilewe respect the existing State borders that we share withour neighbours  we wish to erase them in everyday lifeand to build a common European future based ondialogue  reconciliation and equality among all nations.We are fully confident that  with the strong support ofthe United Nations  we will attain that goal.But the insistence by some on the creation of asovereign State of Kosovo amounts to a call for thebreak-up of the sovereign State of Serbia andMontenegro. Such an objective breeds new hatred andmisery and is contrary to the basic tenets ofinternational law and to the Charter of the UnitedNations. We will not agree to the violation of the rightsof our State and its citizens.By applying consistent standards in addressing allcrimes  the United Nations will assist the efforts of thedemocratic Government in Serbia and Montenegro tofulfill our obligations to the International CriminalTribunal for the former Yugoslavia  which is somethingwe must do. The nation is innocent; responsibility restson the individual  and none of those who have beenindicted for war crimes has the right to hold a nationhostage.All of us on this planet are brothers and sisters.Gens una sumus: we are all one family. Therefore  theprimary obligation of any majority  whether religious racial or ethnic  is to fully protect the rights ofminorities. I can assure the Assembly that myGovernment is unreservedly committed to thatprinciple."
"190",7586,"ZAF",59,2004,"There are some matters onwhich we all agree. One of these is that  later this year we will receive the important report that will be tabledby the High-Level Panel on Threats  Challenges andChange  which was constituted by our Secretary-General. The other is that  next year  we will mark thetenth anniversaries of the Copenhagen World Summiton Sustainable Development and the Beijing WorldConference on Women and discuss their outcomes. Thethird matter on which we all agree is that  next year  wewill observe the fifth anniversary of the adoption of thehistoric Millennium Declaration.We will also agree that we took all theseinitiatives ó the convening of the social  womenís andmillennium summits and the constitution of the High-Level Panel ó because we were of one mind that wehad a number of problems that needed to be solved. Inthe Millennium Declaration  we used inspiring wordsto sum up our response to these problems. We said:ìWe have a collective responsibility to uphold theprinciples of human dignity  equality and equityat the global level. As leaders we have a dutytherefore to all the world's people  especially themost vulnerable and  in particular  the children ofthe world  to whom the future belongs.î(resolution 55/2  para. 2)We went on to say:ìWe are determined to establish a just and lastingpeace all over the world in accordance with thepurposes and principles of the Charter.î (ibid. para. 4)We also said that our efforts to make globalizationfully inclusive and equitable'must include policies and measures  at theglobal level  which correspond to the needs ofdeveloping countries and economies in transitionand are formulated and implemented with theireffective participation'. (ibid.  para. 5)To this we added the commitment that'We will spare no effort to free our fellow men women and children from the abject anddehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty'.'We are committed to making the right todevelopment a reality for everyone and to freeingthe entire human race from want.' (ibid. para. 11)Naturally  we have no choice but to agree that wedid say all these things and would undoubtedly agreethat we meant what we said. I trust that this will notmark the end of the range of issues over which wewould speak with one voice. I say this because  when Ihave asked myself the question 'Have we achieved thegoals we set ourselves?'  I have found it impossiblenot to answer that we have failed. There may very wellbe others among us who will take a different view andsay that a good beginning has been made and thereforethat it is too early to say we have failed.But I am certain that if we say to those affectedby violence and war that we have made a goodbeginning towards the establishment of a just and11lasting peace all over the world  they will not believeus. I am equally certain that if we say to those who goto bed hungry every day that we have made a goodbeginning towards freeing the entire human race fromwant  they will also not believe us.I would make bold to say that the vision ofhuman dignity  equality and equity at the global levelthat we enunciated in this imposing forum four yearsago resonates among the ordinary people who arevictims of hunger and war as a beautiful dream thatwill inevitably be deferred.Does this mean that  when we made the promiseswe made  we deliberately intended to tell the billionsof ordinary people a lie? The answer to that question isobviously ìnoî. Did we speak as we did simplybecause talk is easy and cheap? Again  the answer tothat question is obviously 'no'. The question musttherefore arise as to why the grandeur of our words andthe vision they paint ó of a world of peace  free ofwar  a world characterized by shared prosperity  free ofpoverty - has not produced the grand results wesincerely sought and seek.It would seem to me that the answer to thatquestion lies in the fact that we have as yet notseriously confronted the difficult issues that relate tothe uses and perhaps the abuses of power. Yesterday  inhis statement on his report on the work of theOrganization  our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan spoke eloquently about the 3 000-year-old Code ofHammurabi  and said: 'That code was a landmark inmankindís struggle to build an order where  instead ofmight making right  right would make might'(). We took it that the Secretary-General was in his own elegant way  drawing our attention to thecentral question of our day: the uses and abuses ofpower.Contemporary human society is characterized bya gross and entrenched imbalance in the distribution ofpower. That power is held and exercised by humanbeings. As human beings  the powerful share manythings with the powerless. Together  the powerful andthe disempowered share the common human needs toeat  to drink water  to be protected from the elements to dream  to love  to laugh  to play  and to live.But life itself tells us that all of that describesonly what human beings share. The rest  the relationsamong us as social beings  is defined by our variedaccess to power and its exercise.Without fear of contradiction  I have said that weall agree that later this year we will receive the reportof the High-level Panel on Threats  Challenges andChange. I am equally convinced that  depending onwhere we stand relative to the power equation  we willhold radically different views about what constituteshumanity's most serious threats and challenges  andtherefore what must be changed to respond to thatperceived reality.Both the powerful and the disempowered willundoubtedly agree that terrorism and war represent aserious threat to all humanity. They will agree that wewere right to make the commitment in the MillenniumDeclaration to work for'a just and lasting peace all over the world inaccordance with the purposes and principles ofthe Charter' (resolution 55/2  para. 4).Many of those who have already addressed theAssembly have correctly drawn our attention to manyinstances of terrorism and war  to which we are allopposed. They have spoken of the bombings of theUnited States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and ofthe African and American lives those claimed; of theheinous 11 September outrage in this city; and of theacts of terrorism in Indonesia  Saudi Arabia  Morocco Spain  Israel  Gatumba in Burundi  Beslan in theRussian Federation  and elsewhere.They have correctly drawn our attention to theviolent conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo Burundi  the Sudan  Palestine  Israel  Iraq Afghanistan  Chechnya  Abkhazia  South Ossetia andelsewhere  and to other unsolved problems  such asself-determination for the people of Western Sahara that cry out for a solution.Both the powerful and the disempowered agreethat the international community must act togethersuccessfully to confront these situations and thereforethe threat and challenge of terrorism and war.However  the powerful will also make theadditional determination that terrorism and warconstitute the central and principal threat and challengethat human civilization faces. They will make thatdetermination because  almost by definition  theterrorists target them simply because they arepowerful; they have no logical choice but to identifyterrorism as the central and principal threat andchallenge they face  and to which they must respond.12Because of their place in the power equation what they decide will necessarily represent the globaldecision of what constitutes the central  principal andmost urgent threat and challenge to human society necessitating various changes in the global system ofgovernance. What they decide will translate into a setof obligatory injunctions  issued by this Organization which all Member nations will have to accept andimplement.Again  both the powerful and the disempoweredwill undoubtedly also agree that poverty  want andunderdevelopment constitute serious problems that allhumanity must confront. Many of those who havealready addressed the Assembly have correctly drawnour attention to the reality of poverty  which billionsacross the globe continue to experience.Among other things  they have correctlyreminded us of the fact that some countries are poorertoday than they were a decade ago. They have pointedto the virtual certainty that we will fail to meet theMillennium Development Goals we set ourselves fouryears ago.Both the powerful and the disempowered agreethat the international community must act togethersuccessfully to confront this situation  and thereforethe threat and challenge of poverty andunderdevelopment. However  the disempowered  whoare also the poor of the world  will also make theadditional determination that poverty andunderdevelopment constitute the central and principalthreat and challenge that human civilization faces.They will make the determination that  becausethey are the daily victims of deprivation and want which claim the lives of millions every year ótranslating into cold statistics about shortened lifeexpectancy - deprivation and want represent thecentral and principal threat and challenge thathumanity faces  necessitating changes in the globalsystem of governance in order effectively to respond tothat reality.But because they are powerless  those billions -the overwhelming majority of the same humanity thatneeds to eat  to drink water  to be protected from theelements  to dream  to love  to laugh  to play  to live -will have no possibility of persuading thisOrganization  laughably described in the MillenniumDeclaration as 'the most universal and mostrepresentative Organization in the world'  to translatewhat they have concluded into obligatory injunctions issued by this Organization  which all Member nationswill have to accept and implement.If  for a moment  we resist the temptation tospeak in parables or in tongues  for fear that we mightbe punished for telling the truth  we must say that thisstark and simple reality reflects the distribution ofpower and wealth in contemporary human society.The wealthy and powerful feel  correctly mortally threatened by the fanatical rage of theterrorists. They have the power to respond to thispresent and immediate danger with all their might  and because they are mighty  they can determine for allhumanity that the principal threat to them is theprincipal threat that all humanity faces.The poor and powerless feel threatened by apermanent hurricane of poverty  which is devastatingtheir communities as horrendously as hurricane Ivandestroyed the Caribbean island State of Grenada.But  tragically  because they are poor  they do nothave the means to respond to this present andimmediate danger. Neither do they have the power todetermine for all humanity that what they decide is theprincipal threat they confront  is also the principalthreat that all humanity  including the rich andpowerful  faces.In the Millennium Declaration  we spoke of theneed to implement'policies and measures  at the global level  whichcorrespond to the needs of developing countriesand economies in transition and are formulatedand implemented with their effectiveparticipation' (ibid.  para. 5).Perhaps the mistake we made was to assume thatthe contemporary distribution of power in humansociety would permit this outcome  and that  regardlessof this fundamental consideration  it would be possiblefor the concerns of the poor to take precedence on theglobal agenda and the global programme of action.We comforted  or perhaps deluded  ourselveswith the thought that this Organization is 'the mostuniversal and most representative organization in theworld' - afraid to ask the question  is it?Every year many of us who have spoken  and willspeak  from this rostrum make an annual pilgrimage tothis great and vibrant city to plead the cause of the13poor of the world  hopeful that this time our voices willbe heard. Every year  after a few days  we pack up ourbags to return to the reality of our societies  whosesqualor stands out in sharp contrast to the splendour ofNew York and this majestic precinct that constitutesthe headquarters of the United Nations.In the aftermath  resolutions are passed. Againand again our permanent representatives  with theirextraordinary and plenipotentiary powers  report thatthose resolutions oblige us to act to thwart the deadlyplans of murderous terrorist gangs. Again and againthey report that yet another appeal has been made tothe mighty and the lowly alike  voluntarily to respondto the cries of the wretched of the earth.We are truly proud and inspired to see you Mr. President  presiding over the proceedings of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-ninth session  because weknow that you will discharge your obligations as a sonof the poor of the world should. We are moved by thefact that you had as your predecessor President JulianHunte  who also understood intimately what must bedone to ensure that the United Nations can become  inreality  the indispensable common house of the entirehuman family.As an Israeli said to us at our headquarters inPretoria a fortnight ago  it is perhaps time that we  thepoor and powerless  abandon our wheelchairs andbegin to walk unaided. Perhaps that will help to buildthe social order of which Hammurabi - and KofiAnnan - spoke  in which right makes might and notmight  right."
"191",7628,"ZMB",59,2004,"I am deeply honoured tohave this opportunity to address the General Assemblyon behalf of the people of Zambia.I would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Pingon his assumption of the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-ninth session. As one of the 21Vice-Presidents for the current session  Zambia pledgeshim its support and cooperation. I would also like topay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Julian Robert Hunteof Saint Lucia  for the efficient manner with which hepresided over the proceedings of the fifty-eighthsession. I wish to extend our sincere appreciation toSecretary-General Annan for his relentless dedicationto the cause of international peace  security andeconomic development.This session of the General Assembly convenesat a time when vexing problems plague the worldcommunity. Zambia believes that the key to addressinga host of such difficult global issues as terrorism HIV/AIDS and the humanitarian tragedy in Darfur is tofind multilateral solutions  often within the context ofan effective United Nations. Indeed  that is what Iwould call a multilateral imperative. With that in mind Zambia welcomes the report of the Secretary-Generalon the work of the Organization.It is also Zambiaís hope that this session willbuild on past achievements to advance the globalagenda. Accordingly  Zambia supports the conveningof the high-level plenary meeting next year in NewYork on the Millennium Development Goals  to which20we committed ourselves in 2000. We firmly believethat all Member States have a collective responsibilityto implement the commitments set forth in theDeclaration.My delegation supports the ongoing reforms ofthe United Nations. Zambia shares the concerns ofother countries that this important process has not yetbeen completed. Zambia believes that the reformsshould address the concerns of developing countries. Inthat regard  we look forward to the progress reports onthe reforms. Zambia appreciates the recent initiativesof the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session on the revitalization  reform andenhancement of the working methods of the GeneralAssembly. My delegation stands ready to continueactively participating in the reform process during thissession. We commend the President and hispredecessor for the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly as the highest deliberative and decision-making organ of the United Nations.Regarding the reform of the Security Council Zambia remains concerned about the lack of progress. Itherefore appeal to this Assembly to support the effortsof the Security Council to enhance its decision-makingand liaison methods during this session.As I stated at the outset  Zambia believes inmultilateralism  which continues to be an indispensableinstrument for achieving global consensus onimportant  life-saving issues. As a global community we face challenges that are transnational andinterconnected in nature. It is essential that we takeadvantage of the immense problem-solving potential ofmultilateralism. Unilateralism should have no place inthis global era. Zambia reaffirms its support for theUnited Nations initiatives in the fight against globalterrorism and the proliferation of small arms and anyform of weapon of mass destruction. We call upon theinternational community to take all necessary stepswithin the purview of the United Nations to combat thescourge of terrorism in all its manifestations. Thatscourge needs to be fought relentlessly  with totalcommitment and vigour. Zambia also pledges tocontinue supporting the Counter-Terrorism Committeeof the Security Council.My delegation would like the United Nations andthe world community at large to assist Member Statesin building their capacity to fight internationalterrorism. And we want to express our heartfeltsympathy for the innocent victims of terrorism inRussia  here in New York and elsewhere.Zambia expresses its profound dismay at thecontinued unrest in the Middle East and the impasse inthe Palestinian-Israeli peace process. We call on theparties to that longstanding conflict to allow for fullimplementation of the Quartetís road map. Zambiareiterates that the road map offers a viable solution tothe Middle East question. We endorse and support theinitiatives for a peaceful settlement of the Middle Eastcrisis. In the same vein  Zambia welcomes the adoptionof Security Council Resolution 1546 (2004) on Iraq.We fully realize that economic  social andpolitical development is the primary responsibility ofeach individual country. We are pleased that the Groupof Eight countries continue to support the NewPartnership for Africaís Development (NEPAD)  theprimary objective of which is eradicating theincreasing poverty on our continent and puttingAfrican countries on the path of sustainable economicgrowth. We recognize that the new initiative is byAfricans and for Africans  but we cannot ignore thevital importance of assistance from the internationalcommunity through increased official developmentassistance.External debt has continued to consume a largeproportion of the national incomes of developingcountries  especially the least developed countries(LDCs). The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)Debt Initiative was established to assist highlyindebted poor countries to reduce external debt tosustainable levels. Admittedly  the HIPC Initiative doeshelp reduce the effects of indebtedness. However  ithas some inherent problems which inhibit the fullrealization of its benefits. The international communitymust  therefore  continue exploring innovativeapproaches toward debt elimination. In thatconnection  we applaud the efforts of President Lula ofBrazil in his search for the appropriate financingparadigm for the eradication of poverty and hunger.As we endeavour to achieve the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  we are very concerned with theplight of the LDCs  which constitute 70 per cent of theworldís population. These countries are likely to missthe target we set of reducing by half the number ofpeople living in extreme poverty and hunger by 2015.21Let me briefly change direction and say a fewwords about certain positive developments in mycountry  a place where freedom truly is on the march.As you know the Programme of Action for theLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010was adopted in Brussels in 2001. Since then  Zambiahas committed herself to serious economic reform including privatization  trade liberalization  theadoption of poverty reduction strategies and thecreation of an environment conducive to both local andforeign investment. While we are doing our part  weexpect corresponding action from the internationalcommunity  as agreed upon in the Programme ofAction. Without assistance  all of our efforts will berendered futile. Our aim is to graduate one day soonfrom an LDC to a developing country.In addition  I am proud to say that myadministration is based on the rule of law. For example we have embarked on an ambitious review of ourconstitution in order to provide ourselves with adocument that will stand the test of time. We call onour cooperating partners and well-wishers to support usin this important endeavour.This year and next - 2004 and 2005 - areimportant years in the lives of our people. I call yourattention to four important events that are taking placein our country during this period.First  on 24 October 2004  we shall celebrate thefortieth anniversary of our national independence.Then  in February 2005  Zambia will be hosting theThird African Conference on Peace Through Tourism the high point of which will be a ceremony honouringthe hundredth anniversary of the birth of former UnitedNations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjild  whodied tragically in a plane crash in Ndola  Zambia.Also next year  my country will celebrate thehundredth anniversary of the founding of the town ofLivingstone  the tourist capital of Zambia and home ofVictoria Falls  also popularly known as the adventurecentre of Africa.In addition  next year we will commemorate theone hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Dr. DavidLivingstoneís first glimpse of Victoria Falls  theworldís largest curtain of falling water  which we callMosi-O-Tunya  or the smoke that thunders.It is my honour to invite your Excellencies  andthrough you all  all your citizens to come to Zambiaand participate in these events.Zambia also welcomes peace initiatives atregional  continental and global levels aimed at endingconflicts and wars in various parts of the world. It isfor this reason that Zambia has continued its activeparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions.With peace prevailing in Angola  that country isnow faced with the challenge of post-conflictreconstruction. Zambia calls on the internationalcommunity to double its assistance to Angola to helptackle the humanitarian situations such as the removalof landmines and the settlement and reintegration offormer combatants and refugees. I am pleased to reportthat on 15 June 2004  Zambia and Angola witnessedthe repatriation of some 363 Angolan refugees innorth-western Zambia  under the auspices of the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner forRefugeesí voluntary repatriation programme. This wasa good start to the programme  but more internationalsupport is needed.In conclusion  I want to reiterate the imperativeof finding multilateral solutions to the problems thatconfront us. In our interdependent world  all of theproblems and challenges that we face can only beaddressed through the concerted multilateral efforts ofthe international community."
"192",7664,"ZWE",59,2004,"I am delighted tocongratulate Mr. Ping  a distinguished son of Africa upon his election as President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-ninth session. Indeed  at a time when thecommunity of nations has committed itself to payingdue attention to issues that relate to development inAfrica through support for the New Partnership forAfricaís Development and other mechanisms  hispresidency gives us the hope and confidence that ourconcerns and aspirations and those of others willremain high on the agenda of this body. Let me alsoexpress our sincere appreciation to his predecessor Mr. Julian Hunte  for the efficient and exemplarymanner in which he conducted the business of the fifty-eighth session.At the fifty-eighth session  I spoke alongsideothers about the need to reform the United Nations andits related bodies so as to make them more democratic.I stressed the perils inherent in the status quo particularly with regard to the dominance of globalpolitics by one super-Power and its closest allies.While we welcome the current debate on enhancing theauthority and role of the United Nations  we wish tostress the need to address the core issue of thedemocratization of international governance. Debate onthe reform of the Security Council has been too longdrawn out because of attempts calculated to protectthose whose interests are best served by the status quo.Ironically  it is some of those same forces that since last year  have been raining bombs and hellfire oninnocent Iraqis purportedly in the name of democracy.Iraq today has become a vast inferno created by blatantand completely illegal and defiant acts of aggressionby the United States  Britain and their allies  in the fulltrail of which the world has witnessed mass destructionof both human lives and property  and with them ourhuman rights  values  morality and the norms ofinternational law as enshrined in our Charter. We arenow being coerced into accepting and believing that anew political-cum-religious doctrine has arisen namely  that there is but one political god - GeorgeW. Bush - and that Tony Blair is his prophet. It is theKoran writ anew in Baghdad.The United Nations Charter remains the only andmost sacred document and proponent of the relations ofour nations. Anything else is political heresy.We note that the Secretary-General has placedbefore the General Assembly the report of the Panel ofEminent Persons on United Nations-Civil SocietyRelations. While civil society makes a significantcontribution to the work of the United Nations  wehope that any arrangements that will eventually beagreed upon will recognize that the United Nationsremains an inter-State and intergovernmental body. It isalso our expectation that the conclusions of the debatewill recognize the different levels of development ofcivil society in different parts of the world.As we prepare for the mid-term review of theimplementation of the Millennium Declaration inSeptember 2005  it is apparent that many developingcountries  including my own country  Zimbabwe  maybe unable to meet the goals and targets set  as oursubregion of southern Africa has in recent yearsexperienced extended and successive periods ofinclement weather  principally droughts  that havewreaked havoc upon our economies and accordinglydiminished our capacity to achieve the MillenniumDeclaration targets. The situation  particularly withregards to the health and education sectors  has alsobeen worsened by the brain drain and the devastatingeffects of the HIV and AIDS pandemic.In that regard  Zimbabwe welcomes thecontinuing efforts of this community of nations to findsolutions to the scourge of HIV and AIDS that hasravaged our peoples and economies. At the nationallevel  we have taken measures  within our limitedmeans  to combat the pandemic. We are alsocoordinating our efforts at the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) level. Regrettably we continue to see an unfortunate and futile tendencyto use assistance in this area as a reward for political26compliance and malleability  making it unavailable tocountries whose Governments are deemedìinconvenientî. Let it be realized that the pandemicdoes not respect boundaries and that these self-serving selective approaches will have little or no meaningfulresults.Zimbabwe has also had to withstand unprovokeddeclared and undeclared sanctions  imposed by Britainand its allies  which are bent on bringing down ourlegitimately elected Government. Mr. Tony Blair  theBritish Prime Minister  has arrogantly andunashamedly announced in his Parliament that hisGovernment was working with Zimbabwe's oppositionparty to bring about regime change. Once again  thelawless nature of that man who  along with hisWashington master  believes he is God-ordained to ruleour world  has shown itself. Regime change is theinalienable right of the Zimbabwean people  who through their sovereign vote  can make and unmake ourGovernments.In any case  we reject completely the assertionsof  and pretence to  democracy by our former colonialmasters  whose undemocratic regimes we taught thelesson of one man ó or one woman ó one votethrough our armed liberation struggles.As we in Africa look at the situation here in theUnited States  we are aware of the plight of the blackpeople ó Afro-Americans ó of both yesterday andtoday and of the semi-slave  half-citizen status that hasbeen their burden. Do the blacks in the United Stateshave the same political  social and economic rights andstatus as their white counterparts? When we will weever have a black ó African-American ó President ofthe United States? Never  ever. Why?I wish to take this opportunity to express theappreciation of my Government and that of the peopleof Zimbabwe for the humanitarian assistance wereceived from the international community during ourperiod of need. Without such support  we would nothave been able to avert a major catastrophe.I am pleased to inform you  Sir  that we have  inspite of the sanctions and evil wishes of Britain and itsallies  now emerged from that difficult phase. We had arelatively good agricultural season this year  and ourland reform programme has begun to make asignificant contribution towards the turnaround of oureconomy. Despite the partial drought at the beginningof the season  we have managed this year to realize agood harvest ó certainly one good enough to ensurethat we meet our food requirements until the nextseason. We plead with the International Monetary Fund(IMF) to stop its strange political mouthings  lies andfabrications about our situation. Our own regionalorganizations know the truth about Zimbabwe. We urgethe IMF to listen to them  and  for once  to be clean.My Government is determined to eliminatecorruption and its corrosive effects on nationaldevelopment efforts. After signing the InternationalConvention against Corruption in November last year we put in place legal and administrative measures thathave already arrested a growing and deliberatetendency to circumvent normal business practices particularly in the financial-services sector. We have however  experienced some setbacks in our efforts  assome countries  particularly in the developed West continue to provide safe havens for fugitive economicsaboteurs from our country.In March next year  Zimbabwe will be holding itssixth democratic parliamentary elections sinceindependence in 1980. Those elections  like othersbefore them  will be conducted in accordance with ournational laws and the SADC principles and guidelinesgoverning democratic elections  recently adopted byour subregion. We do not need any lessons from theNetherlands or its imperialist allies from the EuropeanUnion on this question. Zimbabwe will indeedwelcome to the elections those observers whose soleand undivided purpose is to observe the process andnot to meddle in the politics of the country.The fight against international terrorism hasexposed the duplicity and insincerity of erstwhileleading democracies and human rights monitors withregard to the question of the observance of humanrights. We have seen established internationalconventions thrown to the dogs  and resolutions of theGeneral Assembly and other United Nations bodies onthis issue have come to naught.We are seriously concerned at the fact that theUnited Nations  the pre-eminent instrument for themaintenance of international peace and security watched helplessly while Iraq was unlawfully attackedand plundered by the United States and UnitedKingdom-led so-called coalition of the willing. Suchbelligerent  gunslinging diplomacy and the illegitimateterritorial occupation of the State of Iraq are blemisheson the fair-play image of the United Nations.27While the sadistic scenes from Abu Ghraibremain vivid in our minds  other places in Iraq  as wellas Guantanamo Bay  have provided useful samples ofthe Western concept of respect for human rights. Letme say once again that the West should spare us theirlessons on human rights. They do not have the moralauthority to speak about  let alone parade themselves astorch-bearers of  human rights.Zimbabwe remains deeply concerned about thesituation in the Middle East. We continue to berevolted by a situation where the collective decisionsand authority of the United Nations are disregardedwith impunity on account of big-brother support. Wedemand an immediate lifting of all restrictions illegallyimposed on the Palestinian people  which have seenPresident Yasser Arafat remain a virtual prisoner offoreign occupation. We welcome the recent opiniongiven by the International Court of Justice that foundthe construction of the Israeli wall to be incontravention of international law  and the subsequentGeneral Assembly resolution that demanded animmediate halt to that monstrosity.As the Assembly is aware  the African Unionearlier this year established its own Peace and SecurityCouncil to seek and promote African solutions toAfrican problems. Already  the Council is seized withthe matter of the crisis in western Sudan. Those effortsneed the support of the international community.Let me conclude by assuring Mr. Ping of mycountryís support as he presides over the work of theGeneral Assembly at this session. I wish also toreiterate my countryís commitment positively tocontribute to the fulfilment of the aims and purposes ofthe United Nations."
