"1",16,"AFG",41,1986,"I wish to begin my statement. Sir  by offering you the felicitations of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly for its forty-first session.I should also like to pay a warm tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for his active and selfless service at the helm of the Secretariat.The circumstances in which our world is evolving today are far more fraught with threats to its existence than at any time in the entire history of mankind. The awesome quantities of means of war and destruction piled up in the aggressive centers of power haunt millions of people all over the world with a fear of the unthinkable happening. That legitimate fear of the complete annihilation of the human species  in view of the vast accumulation of very advanced and sophisticated means of making war  particularly in its nuclear dimension  has made the question of war and peace the uppermost concern of all mankind.There is no doubt that the mere existence of such a disproportionately large arsenal on Earth justifies the deep anxiety that prevails in our minds. It is  however  the bellicose mentality with which those in aggressive imperialist circles view the possession and prospective use of such weapons that lies at the core of peace-loving humanity's concern. The grave alarm caused by pronouncements using expressions such as ""negotiating from strength""  ""security through force"" and ""limited or protracted nuclear war"" has been on the increase  owing to the unprecedented material at the service of those militaristic and warmongering doctrines.Having implemented a comprehensive plan to upgrade quantitatively and qualitatively its military might on Earth  the united States imperialists have drawn up and started to put into effect plans to spread some of the most threatening of its newly acquired military technologies and weaponry into outer space  under the guise of a defense initiative  rightly named Star Wars. To overcome the legal barriers prohibiting it from carrying out those designs  the present united States Administration has taken steps to nullify unilaterally and arbitrarily same very hard-won agreements on an ti-ball is tic missiles and strategic arms limitations. It has irresponsibly rendered all bilateral and multilateral negotiating forums virtually paralyzed by putting up an array of unacceptable and unreasonable conditions.While all these things are being done in the imperialist camp  the forces of peace are gathering their strength and calling for the urgent  serious consideration of measures vitally needed to avert the greatest menace threatening the whole of civilization. The Non-Aligned Movement and the socialist community have repeatedly put forward several initiatives aimed at the strengthening and universalization of the process of detente  the halting of the unbridled arms race and the achievement of disarmament.The unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests declared by the Soviet Union over a year ago  which has been extended several times since then in response to the urgings of the international community  is a vivid example of that country's true desire for peace and disarmament. We consider as highly important and very timely the proposal of the Soviet Union for the conclusion of a treaty banning all nuclear tests by all States in all environments for all time. That initiative  which is in full conformity with the position of the non-aligned countries  constitutes a giant leap towards the general and complete disarmament envisaged in the Soviet Union's comprehensive proposal for ridding the world of all nuclear weapons by the end of the century. This proposal  which is unprecedented in its dimensions and foresightedness  enjoys the full support of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  other non-aligned countries and all other peace-loving forces of the world.We also attach great significance to the recent initiative of the socialist countries  including the Soviet Union  concerning the establishment of an international system of collective security embracing all nations  which has been officially submitted for the Assembly's consideration and was referred to  together with the concept of collective Asian security  by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union  Eduard Shevardnadze  in his statement to the Assembly the day before yesterday.The mad arms spree that has filled the thoughts and actions of the United States Administration is accompanied by a dangerous version of State terrorism being carried out under the slogan of neo-globalism. Through this heinous policy the united States arrogates to itself the right to be militarily present in every corner of the world and to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and regions. Hence  the hands of the United States espionage agencies and armed forces are clearly visible in practically all conflict situations  thus widening their scope and rendering their solution extremely difficult.It is precisely such involvement that has led to the continued occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories by Zionist Israel. It is precisely such involvement that has led to the escalating bloodshed in South Africa perpetrated by the apartheid regime against South Africans  the continued illegal occupation of Namibia by the racist Pretoria regime and its increased acts of aggression and intimidation against the front-line States.It is precisely the United States involvement that has plunged Central America into a state of instability and tension  threatening the security  territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence of revolutionary Nicaragua. It is precisely United States involvement that has heightened discord and hostility in South-East Asia  posing a constant threat to the popular order in Kampuchea and exerting pressure on the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the Lao People's Democratic Republic.It is precisely the United States that has launched piratical armed aggression against Libya. It is precisely the United States that has illegally occupied the island of Diego Garcia and turned it into a springboard for aggression and destabilization  thus preventing the realization of the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. It is precisely the United States that has brought to power and sustained such dictatorial and fascistic regimes such as those in Chile  South Korea  El Salvador and elsewhere. And last but not least it is precisely the United States that has organized  trained  financed and armed terrorist and mercenary groups to wage undeclared wars against the peoples of Afghanistan  Angola  Nicaragua and other countries.*Accompanying all this are the greedy economic policies and practices of the United States  which is at the head of a world capitalist system which  through its financial monopolies  has robbed numerous nations of their human and natural resources. The intolerable burden of debt weighing down the backs of the economies of many developing countries  the artificially high interest rates  the low prices for the export commodities of developing countries  the unfavorable balance of trade and other disturbing features of the prevailing world economic situation arethe direct result of the present unjust international economic order imposed by the capitalist countries.The predictable outcome of such policies and practices is manifested in the drastic widening of the gap between the respective living standards and rate of development of developed countries and developing countries. The imperialist policy of using economic assistance as a means of exerting political pressure on the developing countries is no longer confined within the limits of bilateral relations; it has also been extensively employed to undermine the capabilities of multilateral institutions  with a view to curtailing or completely stopping the flow of international development assistance to developing countries  particularly those that dare refuse to submit to imperialist diktat.The non-aligned countries  in the course of their eighth summit Conference  held earlier this month at Harare  arrived at a sober analysis of the present world situation; they called for an immediate end to be put to the arms race and for the diversion of the resources thus released to the alleviation of the suffering of hundreds of millions of people around the world who have been condemned to hunger  poverty  disease and ignorance. They repeated their vigorous call for the early establishment of a new international economic order based on justice  equity and co-operation.The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan considers that the situation in the Middle East has been brought about as a result of the use of force  the denial of the right of nations to self-determination and the acquisition of territory by force. No comprehensive and lasting peace can be achieved unless Israel withdraws its forces from occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories  including Jerusalem  the Golan Heights and South Lebanon  and unless the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  exercise theirright of self-determination  including the right to establish a State of their own in Palestine. We welcome the timely proposal of the Soviet Union on the establishment of a preparatory committee to set in motion the process leading to the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East.In southern Africa  the apartheid regime is faced with enormous upheavals of the vast masses of the people inside the country and with mounting pressure from world public opinion abroad. The use of brute force by the Pretoria regime has brought a result which is the opposite of that expected by the racist regime.The Non-Aligned Movement's Harare Declaration on South Africa proposes specific action to be taken by the international community to put an end to the horrendous apartheid system. It is our hope that the General Assembly will adopt resolutions calling for similar measures to be taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. We express our staunch solidarity with the people of South Africa and their vanguard  the African National Congress of South Africa.We also stand firm with the people of Namibia under the leadership of their sole legitimate representative  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  in their struggle to achieve the full independence of their country. Immediate steps should be taken to give effect to the provisions of the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its fourteenth special session  held last week.In Central America the prospects for peace are seriously reduced by the interventionist aggressive policies of the United States  which is fomenting discord and conflict. We hail the constructive attitude of the Government of Nicaragua towards the process of negotiations  and we express our support for the peace plan put forward by the Contadora Group and the Contadora Support Group which in our view constitutes a solid basis for eliminating a hotbed of tensionfrom this vital part of Latin America.In connection with South-East Asia  we wish to lend our full support to the repealed peaceful demarches made by the three Indochinese countries  and we call upon the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to give a positive response to those peaceful proposals.We associate ourselves with the repeated demands of the international community that an end be put to the senseless fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq and that their disputes be settled through peaceful means available within theinternational legal system.On the question of Cyprus  our position remains unchanged. We stand for theindependence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-aligned status ofCyprus and support the efforts of the Government of that country to find a peacefulsolution in the interest of all Cypriots.We also support the proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of Korea on the basis of the free will of the Korean people  without any foreign interference.We reiterate our loyalty to the cause of all national liberation movements and our support for the restitution of territories under colonial or alien occupationto the sovereignty of their respective nations.The scope of the undeclared war of imperialism  hegemonism and reaction against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has been considerably widened- to encompass the military  economic  psychological  political  diplomatic and other spheres. On the basis of admissions by top-ranking intelligence figures in the United States Administration  we can see that more than two thirds of the budget of the united States Central Intelligence Agency for so-called covert operations is being channeled into the financing of that war. Added to that sum are the large amounts of weapons and money that are given to the criminal bandits by other imperialist  hegemonist and reactionary quarters.The loss of life and the destruction inflicted on our people as a result of this dirty war  although enormous  have not shaken our firm determination to pursue vigorously the destiny we chose with the accomplishment of our national democratic revolution of 1978. Our great strides towards national reconciliation and harmony  as declared and elaborated by Comrade Najib  General-Secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  are producing the expected positive results. The further widening of the National Fatherland Front  embodying all social and mass organizations of the country; the merger of several democratic groups and organizations with the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan; the enlargement of the Revolutionary Council and the Government through the incorporation into them of well-respected non-party personalities; the completion of the process of elections to the local organs of State power and administration; and the preparation of the draft of the new Constitution are noteworthy examples ofour efforts in this direction.In the economic sphere  the investments of the early years of the revolution are bearing fruit. On the material basis - that is  what has been achieved so far  particularly in the fields of land and water reforms and the nation-wide literacy campaign - the first Five-Year socio-Economic Development Plan has been drawn up and half of its first year has already been implemented. While having been realistically prepared  this Plan will create a solid foundation for sustained and long-term growth in the economy of the country.In the military field  thanks to the growing unity of our people and the vigilance of our armed forces  the last remnants of mercenary pockets of resistance are being wiped out and scores of former bandits are surrendering to the State authorities and the people's militia.All those factors point towards a peaceful  prosperous and secure future for our people. The settlement of the situation around Afghanistan and the creation of a stable  harmonious climate will naturally have a very favorable impact on the pace of our national efforts. Since the last session of the General Assembly  the proximity talks between the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and Pakistan  through the intermediary of the Representative of the Secretary-General  have continued to center on the drafting of required instruments that would comprise a comprehensive settlement of the situation that has evolved in South-west Asia. While expressing our gratitude to the Secretary-General and his Representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  for their good offices during these talks  we wish to reiterate the desire of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan for the early and successful conclusion of the process leading to normal and harmonious relations among the countries of the region on the basis of the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of States  respect for the right of all States to determine their own social and economic and political systems  and friendly relations and good-neighborliness among States.The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  in line with its peaceful foreign policy  has adopted a principled  constructive and serious approach in the course of these negotiations and has spared no effort to create an atmosphere of confidence  which is indispensable in such negotiations.With a view to contributing to the furthering of mutual trust  and as a sign of our sincerity in the search for a political settlement  the Governments of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union decided in August 1986 to return to their permanent bases six regiments of the limited military contingent of the Soviet Union which is now based in Afghanistan. It is our earnest hope that this unilateral measure  together with other principled concessions and the flexibility repeatedly demonstrated by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  will be promptly reciprocated by our negotiating partner. A sense of realism and statesmanship calls for bold action and the political will to take the last few steps towards the conclusion of the instruments and to embark on their faithful implementation.The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan stands to gain from such a course  and we are wholly confident that no one will lose by adopting the same course."
"2",55,"AGO",41,1986,"At the outset allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the Assembly at this session  during which  we are confident  we shall be able to achieve the goals we shall propose in this important forum.Allow me also to avail myself of this opportunity to express our admiration of your predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  whose insight and judiciousness greatly helped us to surmount e. number of obstacles and made his mission successful.We should also like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his efforts to find solutions to the many problems facing mankind. Mr. de Cuellar has shown great concern for the preservation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations notwithstanding the limited resources available and the adverse influence of certain Western Powers that are more interested in their own strategic interests than in joining forces to achieve international peace and security.Every year in this same place the representatives of all the nations make a pledge of peace  disarmament  freedom and development  reflecting the determination of the great majority of nations to achieve those goals and thus strive for the survival of the human race.Even given the strong will of the peace-loving countries  a paradoxical reality subsists: the world has never been as exposed as it is today to the threat of a nuclear war that could destroy its entire population.In spite of united Nations General Assembly resolution 3093 (XXVIII)  which prescribes a 10 per cent cut in the military budgets of the permanent members of the Security Council for the benefit of the developing countries  the arms race has not been halted  and it has now reached outer space. While certain countries spend huge amounts of money on their military programs  the majority of the developing countries face a critical economic situation that prevents them from achievingsocial and economicdevelopment programs.We feel that the international community should not remain passive. In the face of this situation  we call for intensified efforts on the part of all peace and freedom-loving countries to reverse the negative trend. Similarly  Angola welcomes the USSR's initiative unilaterally to extend the moratorium on nuclear testing and its recent proposal on the gradual banning and elimination of nuclear arms by the year 2000 and the creation of an international global security system. We also support unconditionally the proposal presented in May this year by the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United Nations Secretary-General regarding the creation of an international organization for the peaceful use of outer space  and we urge all Member States of our Organization to join in this initiative  which undoubtedly would bring benefits to all countries  regardless oftheir stage of development.Angola is a sovereign independent country situated in Africa  in the southernpart of the continent. Since its independence 11 years ago  our country has actively followed a policy of non-alignment and peaceful coexistence. Our Constitution is very clear about our country's willingness to maintain diplomatic relations with all the countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries and of non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States in accordance with the norms of international law governing relations between independent States.Unfortunately it is in that subregion of the his lean continent that is found the abhorrent and obsolete apartheid system condemned by the vast majority of countries. That system continues to be a destabilizing factor for the countries of the region  particularly South Africa's neighboring countries  which are the victims of repeated violent aggression resulting from its arrogance and disregard of the resolutions of the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of African unity.In spite of its strong traditional inclination for peace  our people has not known a moment of peace since the very beginning of its independence  and our country is the victim of continuous armed aggression launched by South Africa from the illegally occupied Territory of Namibia.The People's Republic of Angola continues to be faced with an undeclared war situation created by the South African racist regime  .which has forced the Angolan people to endure enormous sacrifices as a result of the train put on our country's financial  material and human resources  which seriously affected our economic and social development.defenseless children  women and elderly people are among South Africa's favorite targets and the racist forces constantly blow up our bridges  railways and roads and destroy our hospitals and schools  not sparing our industrial installations.Material damage caused to our country has been estimated at $12 billion. This figure does not include the money spent in youth mobilization and youth defense programs. The South African regular army  with the collaboration of South African trained UNITA puppet groups  has perpetrated numerous atrocities and is responsible for a large number of deaths.The Angolan people  who  under the Portuguese colonial rule during^ the 14 years of its struggle for national liberation to regain its freedom and dignity  usurped for five centuries by Portuguese colonialism  had already borne many sacrifices and lost many of its best countrymen  has longed for peace for its newly independent country  so that it could build a strong nation through its natural resources and make use of the country's huge potential for the Angolan people.The imperialist world has always tried to show the current situation in our country as a civil war  while in fact it is rather a foreign invasion of a United Nations Member State  whose territory was partly occupied by the racist SouthAfrican armed forces. That is why Angola continues to insist on the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the South African forces from its territory.Racist South Africa uses the Namibian territory as a springboard for its attacks on Angola. The South African military bases in northern Namibia train the rebel and mercenary groups that infiltrate our territory. It is from those bases that the South African troops make incursions into our country and provide military support to the armed groups which operate in Angola under South African command.South Africa's acts of aggression against Angola  encouraged by successive United States administrations  started soon after our country's independence. In 1975  the apartheid regime invaded our territory and occupied the south.In the light of these facts and in conformity with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter  the People's Republic of Angola requested help from friendly countries. The presence of Cuban troops in Angola has nothing to do with the independence of Namibia and consequently should not be seen as a threat to South Africa  which does not share any border with the People's Republic of Angola.Conscious of the complexity of the international situation and desirous of seeing the impasse created by racist South Africa and the Reagan Administration resolved through United Nations implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the Government of the People's Republic of Angola presented  in a letter from President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar  a negotiation package proposal  dated 17 November 1984.The racist Pretoria regime responded to the well intentioned Angolan initiative with further violent attacks on the People's Republic of Angola. Their most recent acts of aggression were the attacks on the village of Xangongo and the commercial port of Namibe  with a significant number of Angolan casualties and heavy material damage.In the last weeks  we have seen the concentration of over 10 South African army battalions along our southern border  a sufficient signal for us to anticipate a new major offensive against our country.By trying to make implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) depend on the removal of the Cuban troops from Angola  the South African Government  along with the Reagan Administration  resorts to an excuse an old misleading pretext in order to impede Namibia's independence and transform that illegally occupied Territory into a springboard to keep destabilizing Angola with sustained acts of aggression.We could not comment on the world economic crisis without mentioning the problems that are at its origin. Notwithstanding the efforts already made by the United Nations  certain developed countries still adopt policies that will not do much to help improve economic relations between developed and developing countries.In fact  as far as monetary and financial matters are concerned  the problem lies with the inadequacy of structures that no longer meet the exigencies of the world's economic recovery as a result of the selfish policies pursued by certain developed countries  which consequently worsen the balance of payments and the external debt of the developing countries. It is therefore important that  without delay  we concentrate on the task of restructuring the current monetary and financial system in order to enable the developing countries to share in decision-making and take advantage of eventual benefits.It is important to reflect on how far the negative changes of the world's monetary and financial system have exacerbated the external debt crisis of the underdeveloped countries  forcing them into default. Such changes have frustrated the development prospects of those countries  bringing about critical political and social repercussions.While in the first: quarter of 1984 the combined foreign debt of the developing countries already reached $600 billion  today that debt is estimated at more than $900 billion  which is a discouraging factor that frustrates all optimistic hopes for development as long as the developing countries are compelled to spend larger debt repayments amounts than their revenues allow.The International Monetary Fund is far from having achieved the objectives set forth in its by-laws and we feel  therefore  that there is a need in the monetary and financial areas for the creation of a mechanism for South-South co-operation at the regional level to alleviate and ultimately eliminate financial dependence on that institution.One of the causes of the present world economic crisis is  no doubt  the recurrent violation by the developed countries of international trade principles  rules and regulations. The proliferation of discriminatory measures imposed by the developed countries in their trade with their developing counterparts  a growing protectionist attitude and other restrictive measures are responsible for the decrease in the revenue from the exports of the developing countries  which limit their opportunities to invest in other areas more beneficial to their development.In this context  we wish to reiterate the need for all the underdeveloped countries to ratify the Integrated Program for Commodities contained in resolution 93 (IV) of the Fourth United Conference on Trade and Development  and ensure the entry into operation of the Common Fund as soon as possible.The lack of human  material  financial and technological resources in some of the underdeveloped countries should provide a reason for strengthening and improving the co-operation between those countries  and it should provide strong motivation for contributing to the collective and individual autonomy of our countries and strengthening their power to negotiate with the developed countries.In southern Africa  despite the aggressive acts of the racist regime of South Africa  co-operation within the framework of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference has made significant progress in several areas  as demonstrated by the adoption of a number of conclusions and resolutions adopted at the recent submit conference of Baads of State or Government held in Luanda from18 to 22 August 1986.We realize  however  that much remains to be done on the African continent where we have to live and to survive despite our major problems. The United Nations General Assembly's special session on Africa in May 1986  where a program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development was adopted  constituted a positive step towards the adoption by the international community of measures to support the African countries in their struggle to emerge from the difficult situation in which they find themselves.I have decided not to read out the entire text of try speech  but it will be distributed. However  I should like to take advantage of the last few minutes scheduled for my speech to comment briefly on what has already been said  especially the statement made about my country by the United states of America.I have already presented the views of my country on the international situation with respect to southern Africa. Angola is a peace-loving country whose people liberated themselves in 1975 through their own arduous efforts and the militant solidarity of friendly countries  and other Members of our Organization  of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  and of the OAU  in accordance with their principles and the rules of international law. Angola will continue its solidarity with and its unselfish aid to those people still fighting against colonialism  neo-colonialism and imperialism. Its external policy is based on the principles of justice  equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of Member States.I should like to take this opportunity to recall that Angola  as an independent and sovereign State  cannot accept the use of false and distorted representations of the real situation that exists in my country to justify attempts at interference and make false accusations against us of secret motives that my country has always rejected and fought against. My Government does not accept that type of policy  and I must reaffirm that in Angola  it is the Angolans themselves -and only they - who decide their own destiny.The frequent declaration by the United States that Angola is governed by ananti-people and repressive regime is simply a blatant falsehood and an act ofinterference in the internal affairs of the Angolan Government. The truth of thematter is that facts themselves give the lie to such statements and demonstrate thetrue situation. The truth is that for over 10 years  Angola has suffered acts ofaggression committed by the racist regime of South Africa  as a result of the helpthat regime has received from its allies - above all  the Government of the United States of America.The presence of Cuban forces in our country is in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations  and the result of an invitation by our Government. Cuban Internationalist forces are helping our people to defend themselves from external pressure exerted by the racist regime of South Africa  and for that reason will remain on our soil until our Government decides to the contrary.I would like to recall the words of Comrade President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos  in his speech in Cape Verde on 22 December  when he said that the tension in southern Africa is tending towards a progressive aggravation because some of the Western Powers  instead of associating themselves with the efforts of the international community to allow Namibia to accede to independence on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and to eliminate the apartheid system  which undoubtedly is solely responsible for the climate of destabilization  insecurity and conflict prevailing in that subregion  are seeking to protect their financial and economic interests  allying themselves with the white racist minority regime of South Africa."
"3",102,"ALB",41,1986,"Mr. President  I should first of all like to convey to you the warm congratulations of the AlLanian delegation upon your assumption of the important post of the presidency of this lofty Assembly.Judging by recent events  we cannot but note that the current international situation is far from what the peoples desire and aspire to. While the United Nations proclaimed 1986 the International Year of Peace  at this very time international peace and security are under serious threat. The legitimate aspirations and efforts of the progressive peoples and forces throughout the world that cherish freedom and independence are being opposed by the super-Powers  with their designs of expansion and world domination.*The current policy of the super-Powers is dominated by total military  economic and ideological mobilization; it relies more than ever before on the force of arms and nuclear blackmail so that they may achieve their unchanging hegemonist aims. The struggle for military superiority by the two super-Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  has given an unprecedented impetus to their arms race. They have created enormous stockpiles of the most varied weapons  nuclear and conventional  chemical and bacteriological. With world supremacy as their constant objective  the super-Powers are making feverish efforts to develop  manufacture and deploy qualitatively new and ever more deadly weapons.The militarization of outer space is becoming the hub of a new spiral in the arms race. The Star Wars space programs could turn outer space into a staging ground from which those aggressive Powers can prepare to strike at our planet and at mankind. This is a further escalation of their military rivalry and a new manifestation of their policy of force and of ever more intensive propagation of a war psychosis. They are trying to present war as inevitable in order to subjugate other peoples and countries and impose their will upon them.Each of the super-Powers claims that that rivalry restrains its adversary and thwarts its plans to breach the peace. It is clear that every attempt on the part of either to gain strategic points or develop new weapons gives rise to problems and tension between them but never to any desire to safeguard true peace.In last year's general debate in the Assembly there was much talk and some optimism about last November's Soviet-United States summit meeting. It may well be that at the Geneva meeting each of the parties made concessions and gained advantages  but we can say with certainty that nothing of benefit to peace resulted. On the contrary  immediately after that manifestation of what was called ""the spirit of Geneva""  the world was witness to the stepping up of American aggressiveness and provocation in the Gulf of Sirte  to the point where  on the pretext of fighting terrorism  the United States committed serious acts of aggression against Libya  a sovereign State Member of the United Nations  and peace in the Mediterranean and beyond was threatened.Much is now being made of the coming American-Soviet summit and the propaganda machines of the two super-Powers have been doing their best to persuade people that the fate of the world lies in the hands of those Powers.The Albanian delegation believes that the urgent regional and international problems of concern to peoples today cannot be left solely in the hands of the super-Powers  which are concerned with their own interests only and disregard those of other peoples and States. We cannot allow the role of the international community and the United Nations to be reduced to providing a backdrop for the scenarios the super-Powers are preparing or acting as an audience which will take note of the results of their secret diplomacy.Disarmament plans have been presented one after the other. They contain so many proposals and counter-proposals that even specialists on the subject are liable to get them confused. Each super-Power is well aware of the fate reserved for its proposals before it even presents them  but they both believe that they must do something to placate public opinion. While they continue to build up their arsenals  each of them tries to prove  through its propaganda machine  that it sincerely wants disarmament but the other side does not  and is upsetting the ""balance"". Thus a vicious circle is created.Moreover  the new theories and concepts advocated by Washington and Moscow -such as ""neo-globalism"" and a ""global system of security"" - really differ only in form from the old ones and are basically just a means of justifying local conflicts  blackmail  the nuclear threat and even direct armed intervention against sovereign peoples and countries.Like all other peace-loving States  Albania is against the arias race and increases in the war budgets of the imperialist Powers. It is in favor of genuine disarmament. Albania has always been and remains a staunch opponent of the expansionist  aggressive policies of imperialism and social-imperialism. We can never equate world peace with the so-called strategic balance. We can never consider the mere absence of nuclear conflict a situation of peace at a time when the world has faced and is still facing constant threats and continuing wars and local conflicts.The continent of Europe continues to be one of the principal theater of confrontation between the imperialists. No other region of the world contains so great a concentration of conventional and nuclear military arsenals. What makes the situation in Europe even worse is that those arsenals are facing each other in an area containing the border between the two blocs - those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Treaty. This cannot fail to have an effect on all the peoples of the continent  especially the peoples of the member countries of the two political and military blocs led by the super-Powers. It is anomalous and very unjust that more than 40 years after the end of the Second World War foreign troops are still stationed in many countries of the old continent.Europeans are seriously concerned about the grave situation created by the policy that makes them victims of the super-Powers' nuclear blackmail. The peoples and States of Europe cannot consent to being a prey to the ambitions and rivalries of those Powers  or to their countries serving as the targets of nuclear weapons. Therefore  energetic measures must be taken to oppose all attempts to leave the solution of questions vital to Europe in the hands of the super-Powers  for any proposal they might make in that regard would first and foremost serve their own interests.Comrade Raraiz Alia  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor and Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania  has said:""Albania is a European country and as such is vitally interested in all that takes place in the continent ... The divisions and splits and the frequent tension and confrontation between countries of the continent have their roots in participation in the military blocs of the super-Powers. It is our view that only determined opposition to American imperialism and Soviet social-imperialism  the elimination of military blocs and the removal from Europe of atomic weapons and foreign troops can ensure peace in the continent."" The situation in the Middle East remains grave and explosive. The brother Arab peoples are experiencing great difficulties and must daily face the conspiracies hatched by the enemies of their freedom and national independence.That inveterate aggressor  Israel  which enjoys the support and protection of the United States of America  is continuing its expansionist  terrorist activities  its annexation by force of Arab territories and its acts of genocide against the suffering Palestinian people. The events of this year have given new proof of the intrigues against that people and demonstrated the desire of the imperialist Powers and other enemies of the Palestinian people to close the chapter on the Palestinian cause. The situation is grave in Lebanon also. Israel has turned that country into a permanent hotbed of conflict so as to keep the entire Middle East in a state of tension and fan the flames there.Albania has always firmly supported the just struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of its legitimate rights  as well as the struggles of other Arab peoples  whose unity is essential in opposing imperialist-Zionist aggression and the plots of the super-Powers and in order to liberate the occupied Arab territories and make the Middle East a zone of peace and prosperity.The United States and the Soviet Union have transformed the Mediterranean into a militarized sea. The continued presence of their war fleets there is fraught with grave consequences for the freedom and independence of the Mediterranean peoples and countries. A short time after the last session of the United Nations General Assembly there were some very dangerous developments in the region. A number of acts of aggression were committed and escalated into the bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi by the Americans. Those acts of aggression show that the United States is behaving in the Mediterranean in total disregard of the rights of sovereign States and the elementary norms of international law. They also prove that the presence of the war fleets of the super-Powers in the Mediterranean constitutes a constant threat to the peace  freedom  security and independence of the peoples of the region. Peace and security in the Mediterranean can only be safeguarded by stepping up the struggle of the Mediterranean peoples and countries for the withdrawal of super-Power fleets. The Mediterranean belongs to the Mediterranean peoples  whose sincere desire and will it is that the Mediterranean become a sea of peace. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania has always been opposed to the presence of super-Power fleets in the Mediterranean. Albania does not accept  and never will accept  foreign military and naval bases and will never provide any facilities at its ports for the units of those fleets. This is a concrete contribution by Albania to the cause of peace in the Mediterranean.The waves of tension in the Mediterranean and the Middle East are being felt also in the Balkan peninsula  where  apart from the consequences of the tense international situation  from time to time negative regional elements inherited from the past and encouraged by imperialism and reaction come to the surface. The bitter history of the past is remembered to this very day and teaches the peoples of the Balkans not to be taken in by the dangerous games of the imperialist Powers and to avoid and overcome the negative factors which create favorable ground for the increasing intervention by the super-Powers in the region. The interests of the peoples of the Balkans dictate the need for resolute opposition to such interference.It is the sincere wish of the Government of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania that good-neighborly relations should prevail among all the countries of the region. For its part  it will continue to work for an extension of bilateral exchanges  particularly in the fields of trade  culture  science and technology  in the conviction that these exchanges are in the interest of genuine and fruitful co-operation  friendship between peoples and peace and security in the peninsula.The Iran-Iraq war has been going on for several years now  with as yet no signs of an end to the bloodshed. Albania and the Albanian people  which feel sincere friendship for and maintain friendly relations with both Iran and Iraq  can only hope that those two neighbors will put an end to this destructive war  the continuance of which serves the interests of the imperialist Powers.Afghanistan remains a serious hotbed of tension. The Soviet occupation troops must leave that country  and the freedom-loving Afghan people must be left to decide for themselves the destiny of their homeland.Albania has frequently expressed its clear and firm support for the struggle and efforts of the Korean people for reunification of their homeland  in conformity with the aspirations and desires of the Korean people  free of outside interference.In Central America the undeclared war waged by the United States against Nicaragua continues. American policy towards that country illustrates the attitude of the united States towards the States and peoples of Latin America that have chosen the course of free and independent development.The situation in Africa has become a subject of universal concern. A number of international conferences have been organized under the auspices of the United Nations on the problems of concern to the peoples and countries of that suffering continent  such as the critical economic situation  sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa and the Namibian problem.For centuries Africa has been exploited pitilessly by the colonial Powers and has served to enrich the metropolitan countries. Today troops and military expeditions have been replaced by imperialist monopolies and multinational corporations which continue savagely to plunder the colossal wealth of Africa. Thus Africa continues to suffer impoverishment  and whole regions of the continent are threatened with famine. In order to resolve this painful situation the African States must resolutely oppose neo-colonialist policy and take effective measures to exercise their full sovereignty over the national resources.South Africa  that bastion of colonialism and racism in the continent  is not only fiercely pursuing its policy of apartheid but committing flagrant acts of aggression against neighboring countries such as Angola  Zimbabwe and Zambia.In the course of recent events in South Africa the democratic peoples and States of the world have once again seen the unreserved support of imperialism for its offspring  racism. Diplomatic soundings and proposals by the emissaries of States which are keeping the Pretoria regime on its feet  with a view  allegedly  to the so-called reform of the racist regime  are but attempts to prolong its existence at a time when it is reeling under the blows of the just struggle of the African peoples for the freedom and independence and is being condemned by all international public opinion.The Albanian Government and people  sincere friends of the African peoples  will continue to the very end their unreserved support for the just liberation struggles of the Namibian  Azanian and other African peoples to expunge the ugly blemish of racism and apartheid and to rid themselves of the neo-colonialist yoke and oppression.We hear a great deal today about international terrorism. The Albanian delegation wishes to stress that  ro matter who undertakes it or on what pretext  terrorism is an odious phenomenon. We resolutely condemn the terrorism that claims innocent victims. While condemning terrorism  we believe we should also condemn those who have elevated it to a State policy. Are not the American acts of aggression against Libya  Israel's massacre of women and children sleeping in Palestinian camps  the killing of defenseless people in attacks by Soviet aircraft in Afghanistan and the organizing and financing of the Somozist gangs terrorism  even organized terrorism elevated to a State policy? On the pretext of fighting against terrorism  violations of the sovereign rights of peoples and disregard of the norms of international law are justified. Using the same pretext  efforts are made to identify wars of national liberation with terrorism and thus to discredit them. There is no doubt that there could be no more savage terrorism than that practiced by the super-Powers with the aid of aircraft  tanks  warships and entire armies. And it is that kind of terrorism that incites and cultivates all other kinds of terrorism. Therefore  we believe that if we condemn terrorism  we must at the same time strongly condemn those who commit acts of aggression  who interfere in the internal affairs of other States and violate their sovereignty  and who have elevated terrorism to state policy.The world economic crisis continues to have a negative effect on international economic relations and on the political situation as a whole. By means of monopolies  all kinds of machinations and speculative manipulations of the international economic and financial system  the imperialist Powers have stepped up their plundering  especially in the developing countries. One of the most widespread forms of neo-colonialist exploitation  which  in recent years  has assumed unprecedented proportions  is the granting of loans and credits on very onerous terms. Indeed this phenomenon represents a new imperialist strategy which is designed to establish hegemony not only through political and military aggression  but also through economic aggression.The creation of more just international economic relations requires the establishment of a fair ratio between the prices of raw materials and «.hose of manufactured goods  the removal of protectionist measures and tariff and non-tariff barriers  and the free transfer of technology. The grave economic situation can be resolved only by opposing  and taking effective measures against  the system of neo-colonialist exploitation.The Albanian people are looking forward to two important events: the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Party of Labor of Albania  which  under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha  our great and unforgettable guide and teacher  ensured the freedom of the homeland and the construction of socialism  and the Ninth Congress of the Party. The policy of the Albanian State  domestically and internationally  during these four decades  has secured for the Albanian people genuine freedom and independence  progress and well-being  and true social equality  in which the worker has a place of honor. Socialist Albania is developing its economy uninterruptedly on the basis of self-reliance  with no debts or credits. The policy of the Albanian State rests on the interests of our people and of the peoples struggling for national freedom and independence  peace and security.Permit me. Sir  to assure this Assembly that the People's Socialist Republic of Albania  at this session and in the future  together with other democratic States  will spare no effort to promote genuine peace."
"4",170,"ARE",41,1986," Sir  on behalf of the United Arab Emirates it gives me great pleasure to extend to you my heartfelt congratulations on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-first session. This election reflects the confidence of the international community in you and in your country  Bangladesh  with which we have relations of friendship and co-operation. We are fully confident that you will conduct the proceedings of this session wisely and ably.It also gives me pleasure to convey my sincere thanks and gratitude to your predecessor. His Excellency Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  for presiding over the fortieth session with wisdom and competence. On behalf of the United Arab Emirates  I wish to take this opportunity to reaffirm our confidence in the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his continued efforts to strengthen the role of the Organization  and for the initiatives he has undertaken with a view to settling disputes.The celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations reflected the interest of the world in strengthening and enhancing the role of the Organization  particularly through the structuring of international relations in a way that would lead to peace through negotiations and through the peaceful settlement of disputes.The proclamation of 1986 as the International Year of Peace has been a source of hope for many people. However  an objective review of the events of this year does not justify optimism  since certain parties have been trying to weaken the United Nations and diminish its role  a development which poses a threat to the existing international order. There is no doubt that the present financialcrisis is but one aspect of the international political crisis. Although webelieve it is necessary to introduce the necessary administrative and financialreforms  this should not be used as a pretext for undermining the effectiveness of the United Nations.On the other hand  this year has been a year of tension in big-Power relations. Violence has been used and escalated in certain parts of the world and the threat of force and its actual use against certain countries have been resorted to  time after time. This year has alsc seen the possibilities of peacefulsettlement of outstanding problems recede further.The principles of our country's foreign policy rest on a firm commitment to the Charter. They also rest on the desire to strengthen the United Nations organs and support the peaceful methods prescribed by its Charter for the settling of disputes among States. Another basic of our foreign policy is respect for andadherence to the resolutions of the United Nations.That is the reason why my country has always called for adherence by all States to the aims of the Charter. We should resort to its provisions as arbiters in our disputes instead of resorting to confrontation and violence in pursuit ofephemeral interests.Proceeding from that belief  we endorse the proposals for strengthening thesystem of collective security and for enhancing the role of the United Nations. This strengthening of the United Nations should include use by the Security Council of preventive measures  and use of the Security Council as a forum for negotiation in urgent international situations and discussion of the problems and obstacles which have thus far prevented the Organization from performing its role and fulfilling the hopes and expectations of the international community.We hereby emphasize that the United Nations should continue to play its vital role in defusing the serious manifestations of world tensions in the interests of detente  the halting of the arms race and the prevention of the acquisition of nuclear weapons whose proliferation threatens to annihilate humanity. The Organization should also be instrumental in achieving total disarmament and encouraging the. peaceful settlement of disputes.Continued international tensions and worsening conflicts and disputes between States are evident in the Gulf region  where the war is still raging between two Muslim neighbors  Iran and Iraq. This war  now its seventh year  has expanded  and its consequences are no longer limited to the two warring parties. Its unending escalation has disastrous consequences for peace and security in the region and in the world at large. We have always been of the opinion that the only way to end the war and its destructive consequences is peaceful dialog and the will to solve the outstanding problems between the two countries in a manner that preserves their national rights in keeping with the Charter and the principles of international law. My country has translated this belief into action through its participation in the various efforts undertaken to end the conflict. We are prepared to take part in any further efforts directed towards that goal.We regret to find that this war is generating threats to expand its area. We therefore re-emphasize the grave dangers inherent in such a development. We also emphasize our opposition to the occupation of any piece of Arab land. Hence we urge the international community to intensify its efforts and adopt serious and effective measures that will put an end to this devastating war.We appreciate the positive posture of brotherly Iraq towards the international initiatives and efforts undertaken to end the war  including its recent peace proposals and we appeal- to the Islamic Republic of Iran to follow suit and show that it wishes to end the war in the interests of stability and security in the region  and to avert the danger of foreign intervention.The situation in the Middle East still poses serious threats to international peace. There have been more setbacks and failures in the search for peace in the region. Events after the fortieth session of the General Assembly underscore twoaxiomatic facts.First  Israel has continued to create obstacles in the way of peace through its policy of aggression  its continued occupation of Arab land  the escalation of its repression against the Palestinian people  the building of settlements  the confiscation of Arab lands  its sustained effort to vacate Arab and Palestinian lands and disperse their inhabitants  and the escalation and hardening of its conditions in the face of any attempt or initiative aimed at achieving a just and permanent peace.Secondly  the question of Palestine is at the core of the Middle East conflict. No initiative or effort will ever succeed in transcending the realm of theoretical assumptions without finding a just and comprehensive settlement which would ensure the exercise by the Palestinian peoples of their inalienable rights  including the right of return  self-determination and the establishment of their independent State. This has been borne out by events  past and present. Consequently  if Israel is really interested in peace  it should declare its readiness to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian and other Arab lands  including Jerusalem  so that the Palestinian people may exercise their inalienable rights.The only mechanism that inspires hope for the achievement of a just and lasting peace is the international conference on the Middle East that should be convened in accordance with General Assembly resolution 38/58 C  under the auspices of the United Nations and with the full participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The situation in our sister Lebanon is still a cause of grave concern for us. Lebanon has been suffering from the absence of security and stability over the past several years. Israel's intervention in the internal affairs of Lebanon  its occupation of part of Lebanon's territory in violation of the resolutions of theSecurity Council and the principles of international conduct  together with its continued threats and acts of aggression  are a major reason for the protracted Lebanese conflict. These Israeli acts have adverse effects on Lebanon's search for national unity.Thus the restoration of stability in Lebanon is tied to a large degree to Israel's withdrawal from the Lebanese territory that it occupies  and its abstention from intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs. We appeal to the various Lebanese factions to resolve their differences through political dialog. That is the only hope for restoring stability to Lebanon.The situation in South Africa concerns all of us because the racist regime in Pretoria is persisting in its policy of apartheid. It still occupies Namibia and commits acts of aggression against the African front-line States  thus violating their independence and territorial integrity in an attempt to destabilize their security and stability.We condemn this policy which is a crime against humanity and an affront to human dignity. We also condemn the repressive and terrorist practices of the Pretoria regime against the African inhabitants  and demand the imposition of sanctions under the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter on that regime  since the so-called policy of ""constructive engagement"" has demonstrated its utter failure in persuading the Pretoria regime to change its policies.We look forward to the speedy implementation of the united Nations plan for the independence of Namibia in accordance with Security Councilresolution 435 (1978). We declare our support for the Namibian people's struggle under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) * and our solidarity with the front-line States in their determined stand against the aggression of the apartheid regime. We strongly condemn the alliance between the racist regimes of Pretoria and Tel-Aviv and stress the similarity of their racist policies and repressive practices. We call on all States to refrain from co-operating with them in view of the threat that such co-operation poses to international peace and security.The danger of war  particularly nuclear war  increases daily. This danger threatens not only our planet but outer space as well. Thus  the preservation of international peace and security  which is the main purpose for which the United Nations was established  is being undermined. The prevention of war must be the main concern of all States  particularly those that possess nuclear weapons. We hope that the negotiations between the two super-Powers  notably the forthcoming second summit meeting between their two leaders  will lay the necessary foundations for halting the arms race  thus paving the way for complete disarmament and the convening of an international conference on this subject  in which all States would participate.My country supports the proposals for the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones  especially for such a zone in the Middle East. We also emphasize our support for and adherence to the General Assembly resolution on the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We hope that the obstacles that stand in the way of convening the Conference cm the Indian Ocean will be removed and that all the States concerned will be prepared to hold the Conference on the newly set date in 1988.Just as we have always affirmed the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  the non-use of force or the threat of force  and the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means  so we emphasize the need to reach a comprehensive political settlement in Afghanistan that will put an end to foreign intervention and guarantee complete respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of that country.The same applies to Kampuchea  as well as to the countries of Central America  in regard to which we support the principles outlined by the Centadora Group for the settlement of the problems and conflicts in the region.We urge North Korea and South Korea to settle their differences through open dialog in order to satisfy the desire of their peoples for unity.With regard to Cyprus  we are saddened by the obstacles that impede the efforts undertaken to settle that problem. We hope that the Secretary-General will persist in his efforts aimed at bridging the gap between the Greek and Turkish communities and reaching a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement within the framework of which the two communities can coexist  with full security  and the independence  security  territorial integrity  and non-aligned status of Cyprus will be guaranteed.The state of the international economy is no different from that of world politics. The structural imbalances in the economic order have been accentuated  thus leading to sharp fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and a decline in the revenues derived therefrom as well as more protectionism  more discriminatory practices and more trade barriers to the exports of the developing countries. Moreover  those imbalances have triggered fiscal and monetary instability  fluctuations in exchange rates  a marked worsening of the problem of foreign indebtedness and interruption of the process of development. Needless to say  allof this has had and will continue to have adverse effects on the developing countries.In addition to economic instability  the continuous tensions that afflict international economic relations also cause us concern. We are also concerned about the lack of co-operation and serious efforts and the reduction of the role played by international organizations responsible for collective co-operation  while yet another cause of concern is the insistence of certain industrial nations on pursuing economic policies that are not in accordance with the goal of international economic development and do not lead to reform of the structure of the system of international economic relations.In view of all of this  we reaffirm that the existing international economic order is not conducive to balanced and equitable development or just and equal relations among States. We must therefore continue the efforts aimed at restructuring international economic relations so as to establish a new international economic order based on justice  eguality  and mutual interest. To this end  the industrial nations must demonstrate a positive attitude and undertake serious negotiations with the developing countries with the aim of achieving international understanding and thus promoting the cause of development.We emphasize the importance of strengthening the role of the United Nations and its specialized agencies as major forums for dialog and negotiation on matters relating to international co-operation for development. We stress the need to abide by the principle of multilateralism and an integrated approach in dealing with the interrelated issues of money  finance  debt  trade and resources earmarked for development. We appeal to all States to honor the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and to refrain from using the imposition or threat of imposition of trade restrictions  embargoes or sanctions as a political instrumentin the conduct of economic relations  in violation of the Charter.We hope that this session  together with the forthcoming session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development will provide industrial and developing nations alike with the opportunity to make concrete progress towards a common strategy for so] ring existing economic problems and conducting international economic relations in a manner that will protect the common interests of all.The significance of the United Nations lies in the commitment of its Member States to the Organization  as an embodiment of the will of the international community  in order to achieve detente and harmony between East and West and establish constructive co-operation between North and South. The continued existence of the United Nations is a sine qua non of our own existence and of our dealings with each other in this troubled world. We must therefore support ti.d Organization and enhance its status so that we may be able to build the better world we all desire."
"5",217,"ARG",41,1986," Mr. President  first  I would like to congratulate you on your unanimous election as President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We are pleased to see a diplomat like you  of proven merit and knowledge  directing these deliberations. You are a citizen of Bangladesh  a country with which Argentina maintains friendly relations.I also wish to greet the Secretary-General in a very special way and express to him how pleased we are now that he has fully recovered. His dedication  efforts and leadership deserve our most heartfelt gratitude.I would also like to express my sincere appreciation to Ambassador Jaime de Pinies who presided over the fortieth session of the General Assembly in such an able and successful manner. At this juncture  we feel it is our duty to pay tribute to the memory of Olof Palme  a statesman who fought untiringly for the cause of peace and development. His ideas will continue to inspire peoples and direct the actions of Governments.We meet in this principal forum to deliberate  negotiate  and adopt decisions on the fundamental issues which are of concern to the international community: peace  justice prosperity  the defense of human rights  and the sovereignty and independence of nations.The consideration of these issues has become especially relevant in light of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization  which we designated with the following call for hope: ""The United Nations for a better world"". I believe it is thus appropriate and necessary to pause and reflect on the present conditions affecting international relations in contemporary society. The seriousness of the existing conflicts  the increasing disparity in the distribution of power and wealth  the senselessness of terrorism  have reached proportions of such magnitude that they threaten the existence of a community of nations respectful of the right of each and every one of its members.Throughout its existence  the United Nations has served as an essential instrument for the elimination of all forms of discrimination  for decolonization  for the strengthening of human rights and for the promotion of economic and social progress. During these years  mankind has avoided the tragedy of a new war on a universal scale. It is fitting to ask what would have happened in the world without the existence and active presence of the United Nations.Based upon this positive balance  last year's commemoration represented a commitment to multiply efforts in order to advance concretely towards the achievement of the principles and purposes of the Charter that is to say the construction of a better world.However  the past year has not been positive and it must be admitted ""that'the present serious international situation does not seem to arise from a set of circumstances  but rather from a structural manifestation  the expression of a logic which impels the forces leading us towards dissension  confrontation and destruction.Despite the great effort of decolonization  new forms of dependence and exploitation incompatible with the basic provisions embodied in the Charter are gradually imposing themselves and appear to generate an order from which one can discern nothing but new and increasingly unbearable demands on the weakest members of the international community.The bloc policy  a modernized version of the old policy of the balance of power  is replacing the collective security system. Its implications are well known: a reduction of the political independence of the less powerful; a stagnation in the relations between the principal partners; an increasingly inequitable economic order  and a forced homogenization of the world which stifles national styles.The realistic aspiration of progress and justice  which formed the basis of the creation and vitality of our Organization  seems to be disregarded for the sake of hegemonic projects which exclude the alternatives of an authentic peace. Such is the logic of the present-day world  a logic of senselessness.This logic stems from the confrontation of the blocs in a world characterized by a bipolar tendency  which in turn brings about two consequences which affect the developing nations in particular.The first is an increase of what we could call the amorality of international politics  which is a result of the excessive weight of the security factor.This distortion establishes a difference and sometimes an opposition between the criteria applied to internal relations and those applied to international relations.Thus  on the one hand the inviolability of civil rights in the domestic order is not carried out into the international order with regard to matters related to the respect of people's rights to self-determination and independence. On the other hand  the calls for equality found in the internal message are not translated into an external version of equality among States and the resulting respect of their sovereignty.The second consequence is that we suffer because of the problems resulting from the uncertain and arbitrary security borders which separate both blocs  giving rise to a kind of underhanded war which occurs at many different levels  disregarding the basic principles and rules of international law and allowing the confrontation of underground powers and destructive fanaticism.We are all aware of the fact that there can be no real independence as long as there is no effective control within the internal political area of our countries. In addition  we are all aware that this capacity to control tends to weaken and even vanish as a result of the confrontation between the super Powers. The war of propaganda and mutual harassment within our own territories is known to polarize societies and divide citizenry because of questions often unrelated to their own interests. As a consequence  the global strategic conflict ends up by absorbing our national energies.Moreover  while we become involuntary participants in and victims of the global strategic conflict  the regional tension thus created turns bade upon the super-Powers  increasing the danger to their own internal peace and survival. We believe it necessary to recreate a logic of good sense  the logic which led to the creation of our Organization four decades ago. To do this  we must first and foremost rid ourselves of the nightmare of war.The Argentine Government gives the highest priority to the question of nuclear disarmament. Today there would be no winner in a nuclear war: all mankind would be its victim. Based on this simple  apocalyptic reasoning  my Government returns to this forum to insist on this question  which no one can ignore.At the beginning of 1984 the tension between the tJhited States and the Soviet Union had reached a level comparable to the highest level reached in the so-called cold war. Mutual dialog had been interrupted and replaced by a counterpoint of challenge and response  which lead to the development of new weapons and their positioning in territories which until that time had been free of them.This gloomy outlook began to brighten when the United states and the Soviet Union issued  on 20 November 1985  a joint communique in which they stated that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought"". If this sentence means to its authors what it states literally  we have no doubt that the bilateral disarmament negotiations must make progress. Yet this has not been the case.In 1984 the Argentine Government requested that a global disarmament process be initiated urgently. Nevertheless  none of the negative conditions mentioned by us on that occasion has been overcome; on the contrary  in many cases those conditions seem even more negative. Such is the position regarding the vertical and geographical proliferation of strategic weapons  the continuation of nuclear-weapon tests  the deceptive guarantees of security given to States which do not possess nuclear weapons  and the absence of measures to prevent nuclear war.This was why my"" country  on 22 May 1984.- together with India  Greece  Mexico  Tanzania and Sweden  started an initiative seeking to halt the nuclear-arms race and bring about nuclear disarmament. We asked that the tests  the production and the positioning of nuclear weapons and launching systems be suspended. We also requested that this be followed by a substantial reduction in nuclear forces.We  those six countries  have continued to put forward practical initiatives  and during our recent meeting in Mexico we offered our assistance in setting up appropriate verification mechanisms. Such measures could include the creation of temporary surveillance stations in the existing testing zones  arrangements to use the stations in the United States and the Soviet Union to monitor their territories beyond the testing zones and the inspection of large chemical explosions. In addition  we have proposed to the Heads of State of the United States and the Soviet Union that experts from our six countries should meet with Soviet and American experts.The Mexico Declaration begins by proclaiming the right of mankind to peace  which is intimately linked to the right to live  since war would inevitably lead to a holocaust. Therefore  I should like to take this opportunity to ask the States responsible for the arms race to give appropriate consideration to the proposals presented by the group of six.War is also looming over Latin America. The Central American crisis and conflict have become more and more serious. A peaceful settlement in Central America is not only a humanitarian objective for other peoples  but a necessity for all Latin Americans. On the basis of the experience of three years of negotiation  we must now find a new process that will once again give rise to hope. I believe this process should not insist cm the formal aspects of a treaty  it being understood that prior to the peace treaty itself a desire for peace cm the part of all parties is indispensable.Today an exceptional treaty  the Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  is available to us thanks to the great efforts of the Contadora Group. This lucid and complex document is a truly important source for the measures we must take. But for this instrument eventually to be effective  the parties which are to be governed by it must first reach agreement on how to resolve the conflict.It is quite clear what has to be achieved. The Contadora Group ana its Support Group expressed it in the Message of Caraballeda  Venezuela  in February of this year  as follows: the full exercise of self-determination* non-interference in the internal affairs of other States? respect for the territorial integrity of States; pluralistic democracy* no armaments or military bases that would endanger peace in the region*  no military operations by countries of the region  or by countries with interests therein  which would involve aggression or constitute a threat to peace* no foreign troops or military advisers* no support  whether political  logistical or military  for groups seeking to destabilize the constitutional order of the Latin American States by means of force or terrorist acts of any kind* respect for human rights  which means unconditional respect for civil  political and religious freedoms so as to ensure peace by a strictly Latin American process.None of these aims has been fully achieved in the region and some of them have increasingly been violated in the past weeks. These 10 commandments  which should be the Decalogue of hope  are instead the cause of our anxiety.Even though the aims are clear and the international community has endorsed them  it seems that there is growing confusion about how to achieve them.We believe that a reciprocal commitment is needed: on the one hand a commitment among Latin Americans based on the assumption that the political  economic and social development of Central America is the responsibility of those countries which  like ours  are committed to this effort of mediation and peace* aid on the other an agreement among centered Americans regarding democracy and the elimination of any kind of political  military or economic dependency on any Power.If we want peace  it is necessary for the nations of centered America to make a colossal effort to secure their internal and external freedom  that is their democracy and independence; and if we want the Central American countries to be able to make this effort  the remainder of Latin America must pledge its help in bringing about the material and political conditions that will make possible the independence and freedom of the Central American countries.If Latin America runs away from the conflict  the conflict will catch up with it. If Central America does not destroy the causes of the conflict  the conflict will destroy it.This mutual effort could be vain unless there is a third pledge that of the countries that have links and interests in the region to abstain from any kind of intervention  since what happens in the future will largely depend on them and since the peace and security of those nations is contingent upon satisfactory solution of the Central American conflict.Our country is willing to honor its pledge; we hope that at this decisive time those who have done most in favor of peace will once again take the initiative and redouble their efforts.The identification of practical ways to eliminate injustices which may create new areas of tension will also contribute towards peace and development in Latin America. In this regard  we support the just and legitimate efforts of our sister republic of Bolivia to recover a direct  useful and sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean. This would be a just historical indemnity which  by eliminating the land-locked character of that country  would promote its development. Similarly  I wish to reiterate the support of my country for all of Panama's efforts to ensure full compliance with the Treaties applicable to the Canal ana to obtain all countries' endorsement of the Protocol to the Treaty Concerning Permanent Neutrality and Operation of that interoceanic waterway.My country's backing of the initiative of the Federative Republic of Brazil to designate the South Atlantic as a zone of peace and co-operation of the peoples of South America and Africa also takes its inspiration from the same dedication to peace that characterizes the Argentine people and Government. Demilitarization of the South Atlantic and avoidance of the arms race will contribute substantially to a lessening of international tension.My Government wishes to reiterate that the sovereignty dispute over the Malvinas  South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands is an issue of permanent interest to the Argentine Republic and represents the central problem which keeps it apart from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.We are determined to achieve a peaceful  equitable and final solution to this dispute through serious negotiations in good faith. If such a solution were achieved  relations between the two countries would be established on solid and permanent bases. However  despite the repeated calls of the international community  the United Kingdom still refuses to accept comprehensive negotiations.The international community has fully understood the necessity for the Republic of Argentina and the United Kingdom to resume negotiations ands.has expressed this desire by supporting last year's resolution 40/21  adopted by a majority of votes in the General Assembly.	'Nevertheless  the international community once again is witness to the intransigent stand of the British Government  which persists in ignoring  its call and rejects negotiations as the appropriate and rational way to solve international disputes.Such an attitude only prolongs a situation which  because of its consequences  is as unacceptable as it is detrimental: First  the excessive military presence in the South Atlantic constitutes a serious risk to Argentina and affects the entire region.Secondly  the strategic airport built on the islands and the extraordinary naval reinforcement jeopardize the stability of an area which is part of a Latin-American nuclear-weapon-free zone. Thus the Malvinas Islands have been turned into a new zone of strategic interest and attract the global East-West conflict towards them.Thirdly  the illegal and arbitrary ""Exclusion Zone"" unilaterally declared by the United Kingdom around the Malvinas Islands precludes Argentina from engaging in legitimate and peaceful activities in waters and air space falling within its jurisdiction. In addition  this has caused the uncontrolled exploitation of the area's fishing resources.The Argentine Government reiterates its willingness to initiate negotiations in search of an imaginative solution that would  through special statutory safeguards and guarantees  also allow the interests of the present inhabitants of the Malvinas Islands to be adequately addressed.The next step on the road towards final solution of the question of the Malvinas Islands must be taken by the British Government and the Republic of Argentina  together with the international community. They await a positive reaction  as can already be observed in certain political spheres of the United Kingdom as well as in other sectors of the public opinion of that country.I should' like to avail myself of this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for his assistance and constant efforts to promote fruitful negotiations.-1 The Argentine Government asks him to continue his efforts  and reiterates that he can be assured of its broadest and fullest co-operation.Before addressing myself to other important issues that deserve our special attention I wish to mention one which preoccupies us all by virtue of its flagrant nature: the untenable policy of the Government of South Africa  which offends not only the written rules of international law but also more basic and fundamental rules which each one of us carries within his conscience.The Argentine Government has repudiated time and again the policy of apartheid and its inexorable consequence: the harassment of the republics of southern Africa.Faced with the continuing acts of aggression by the Government of South Africa which are the other side of an institutionalized regime of racial discrimination  unacceptable in the framework of the contemporary international community  we have broken diplomatic relations with the Republic of South Africa.Once again we reiterate in this forum the Argentine people's expressions of friendship to the oppressed people of South Africa  as well as our support for the just struggle it is engaged in to establish a free  egalitarian and democratic society in its country.On this occasion  I believe it necessary to confirm the unlimited support of the Argentine Government for the people of Namibia - represented by the South West Africa People's Organization - which still suffers from the illegitimate occupation of its Territory by South Africa.As I stated in my message addressed to the recently concluded special session of the General Assembly on Namibia  this situation is unacceptable. Its continuation can only be explained by the imbalance of the forces involved and the importance of the interests seeking to perpetuate it.There are countries which  though they do not belong to the region  still have a great responsibility towards it. This responsibility is incompatible with the continuing existence of racism  colonialism and interventionism - scourges that are contrary to human dignity  violate human rights and breed violence and destruction.There is no rule of law in South Africa or Namibia. The longer it takes to establish it  the more widespread will be the violence and injustice; the greater will be the insecurity of those who share with us the Atlantic basin.The Middle East region continues to pose a risk of conflict  escalation and war  as we have unfortunately witnessed.We the Argentine people believe in the possibility and need for peace in that tormented region - a peace based upon truth  justice and freedom for all  without exception  a peace based on the negotiation of the legitimate interests by all those who hold inalienable rights that no one can ignore  a peace based upon mutual respect and tolerance. That is the context in which Argentina affirms the necessity for recognition of the Palestinian People's right to form on its own territory an independent State enjoying full self-determination and governed by authorities freely chosen by the Palestinian people.Similarly  we uphold the right of all the States in the region  including Israel  to live within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.For the same reasons we condemn all measures which jeopardize the full force of human rights  as in the case of the forceful occupation of territories  acts of terrorism and violence  which cut short human lives  destroy families and mutilate children and adolescents.I wish to mention especially the conflict that has been raging between Iran and Iraq since 1980: that war must cease. The peace  which should never have been broken  must reign once again. The peoples of both nations  which have suffered and been terribly afflicted  must once again co-exist as brothers. The Argentine Republic is friendly to both; it has supported and will continue to support all efforts to restore their full enjoyment of the right to life and peace pursuant to the United Nations Charter and the principles of non-alignment. A part of this pattern of tension can also be observed in Lebanon  a country with which we have relations of long-standing and deep friendship. He can only express our hope to see once again a flourishing and peaceful Lebanon  enjoying fully its sovereign rights  free fros occupation of any part of its territory and actively contributing towards the progress and stability of the region. The senselessness which tends to dominate the international scene reveals itself crudely in the world economic situation  and this widens the gap separating an ever more powerful center from an ever weaker periphery. To this we must add a technological monopoly which threatens to disenfranchise even further the developing countries. The lack of access to the more advanced technologies will accentuate the economic instability but  more than this  it will affect the capability of the nations left behind to act politically  submitting them to a new form of colonialism.Unfortunately  it must be admitted that in the year that has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly no events have occurred in the area of international economic relations that would raise our hopes for a more equitable and rational system. On the contrary  the situation of international trade has deteriorated  showing clearly the doubly unjust principles on which it is at present based. On the one hand  something that is a fallacy is stated: de facto equality among nations. From this premise  rules are conceived which not only do not favor possibilities for development of the poorest but also perpetuate  if not intensity  already existing inequalities. Disregard for de facto inequality leads to the creation of an actual de jure inequality among nations  through a body of norms and principles which all must accept as the only one capable of governing commercial exchange.The poorer nations  the youngest ones  the former colonies  we are told  should not and cannot search for the road towards their own development and progress outside the framework which the ridlest nations  the most established Powers and the most important cities of the world need to strengthen their trade and productive investment.Now comes the second inequitable basis. The evolution of the international economic order is showing that what the backward nations cannot do the richestcan. Thus one arrives at the paradox where precisely those who seated the rules in accordance with their needs and their requirements are not only the first but indeed the only ones who violate their own rules when this becomes necessary for the defense of their own interests.The process which led to starting the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations show how far the logic of discrimination reaches: while the opening of markets for goods and services is proposed  protectionism and unfair competition increase as regards traditional raw materials. Since its inception GATT has failed to address the question of raw materials.The deterioration of international trade has worsened the problem of external debt owed by developing countries  especially that of Latin America. In our region the standard of living has regressed 10 years in the past 5 years. In addition  servicing foreign debt in the past four years has turned Latin America into a net exporter of capital: we have exported more than 3100 billion.The response of the Latin American countries has been an enormous effort to put order into their economies  improve efficiency and increase exports  an effort that is nevertheless neutralized by the drop in raw material prices on the international markets. The logic of senselessness puts us into this absurd predicament in which our efforts to comply with the debt requirements meet with discrimination and ever growing protectionism on the part of our creditors.The subsistence of the negative factors of the prevailing international economic system obliges Latin American countries to make even greater efforts to transform regional co-operation into a concrete fact. This is the reason behind the ambitious integration agreement entered into recently by my country and the Federative Republic of Brazil  the final purpose of which is to create a common(Mr. Caputo  Argentina) market system between our two countries. As my dear colleague from Brazil has said  we share the fraternal aspiration to ""grow together"". Also  as the Republic of Uruguay is doing  we hope that other Latin American countries will join this initiative. Thus Latin America is moving from the rhetoric of integration to a common effort which translates into practical initiatives.The Cartagena Consensus  which remains fully valid as a means of solving the debt problem  as well as other joint endeavors which direct the course of the democracies of Latin America  has paved the way for the possibility of a new regional arrangement to serve our peoples and all mankind  not contradictory to but complementary with the other regional arrangements which more and more characterize the times in which we live.One of the main themes on the agenda of the General Assembly refers to the crisis within the United Nations. The Organization can only be strengthened by a rationalization of its duties based on the expert report submitted for our consideration. However  in addition to the obvious need for a readjustment of the work procedures and administrative and financial reforms  a concern arises with regard to the true purposes and possibilities of our Organization.This is where an attempt at frankness must play a fundamental role. For four decades the United Nations has assisted in the reconstruction of economies shattered by war and has helped countries subjected to colonial domination to gain their independence. Nevertheless  fundamental tasks remain to be undertaken in this search in the United Nations for a better world. To carry out this substantial task  we must all contribute  whether or not this is convenient to our own particular interests.This is how we see the world and its conflicts. We do not expect miracles but we shall not let ourselves be disheartened. We trust in the ability of mankind to understand existing situation and apply its will to transform it. But there will be no transformation of the present without a proper understanding of the fundamental facts that shape it  nor will it be possible to build the future unless there is a clear idea about what we expect for our civilization.The years remaining until the end of this century present a challenge to our intelligence  to our will  and fundamentally to our sense of ethics in relations among men and nations.Our presentation is essentially political  in the profound sense of this word. We believe in peace as a true formula for coexistence  in equality as a predicate of action towards the common welfare  in development as a focus for the energies of men and women to build a new society.We have no other weapons than our minds  and this is why we ask that this logic of senselessness be abandoned in order that common sense may be restored. We repeat that we must regain our senses so that the system of peaceful coexistence of our various national identities may survive. For more than 40 years that has been the principal objective of our Organization.We do not believe that our world can organize itself to build a better future by favoring immediate interests derived from strategic and military concepts or proceeding from the basis of a continuous confrontation between the great hegemonic blocs that use their power politics in dealing with those which do not belong to any of the power blocs. We prefer a world in which people can coexist peacefully and freely  not in submission or under oppression but rather on the basis of respect for diversity. As Albert Camus once said:""The extremisms of the right or of the left seek totality  that is to say  the elimination of differences  and not unity  which is the harmony of contrasts."""
"6",276,"ATG",41,1986,"Let me begin by extending my congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. This is a crucial convocation  which is confronted with issues never before placed before the Assembly. My sense of discomfort over our capacity to find solutions to the difficulties faced by the Organization is eased only by the knowledge of your own capacity for problem-solving and for bridge building. This Organization has faced many trials and survived an equal number of tribulations in the 41 years of its life. But I suspect that it has faced no greater test than the current financial difficulties which hamper its ability to function. No nation represented in this Assembly should allow the United Nations to succumb to pressures spawned by the misguided notion that this great Organization should be weakened; for the Organization  and the Charter which governs its operation  remain as important and vital to the world today as they did on 26 June 1945  when United States President Harry Truman told the closing session of the first General Assembly in San Francisco that ""the Charter of the United Nations is a solid structure upon which we can build a better world"".In 1945  the world was reeling from the brutality of a war which left millions dead and many more millions with their livelihood in shreds. The devastation was all pervasive and mankind recoiled from the horror of its self-destruction. The forces of fascism and tyranny  which had unleashed a monstrous regime of terror  had frightened nations  large and small  into the realization that  in Truman's words  ""if we had the United Nations Charter a few years ago - and above all the will to use it - millions now dead would be alive"".It was against that background of massive human conflict and destruction that nations found the capacity to co-operate in the creation of the United Nations  and to set out in its Charter the principles of international conduct that could lead to lasting peace and security for all.In 1986  conditions are not dissimilar. Today  millions are still dying from human conflict and neglect. Tyranny and terrorism still stalk the globe  and tension and fear continue to follow in their shadow. Today  however  we have the United Nations Charter*  but do we have the will to use it? To quote the words of the Secretary-General's report: will we ""meet our financial obligations under the Charter""?In June 1945  President Truman said*  ""if we should falter in the future in our will to use the united Nations Charter  millions now living will surely die"".Those millions have died  for we have failed to use the Charter. How many more must die in the Middle East  in Central America  in South Africa and in terrorist attacks  before we use the Charter? How many more mothers must die from starvation? How many more children must live a life too weak to walk  too sick to cry  too hungry to care that they die  how many more  before we use the Charter?For small nations  such as mine  this is no empty question; it is a vital issue. Our very survival depends upon respect for the Charter of the United Nations by other  more powerful States*  for tomorrow we may be the victim of a stronger neighbor's aggression or  worse still  the casualty of someone else's war.But apart from our own self interest in promoting respect for the Charter and in maintaining the work of the United Nations  the smallness of our size in no way diminishes the magnitude of our anxiety over the continuing conflicts in the world  nor does it soothe the searing pain upon our consciousness when we witness the agonizing misery of thousands  world-wide  who suffer from malnutrition and lack of adequate medical care.In the name of those millions who died in order to bring mankind to the understanding that the united Nations is imperative; in the name of those millions  who have since died while we failed to use this Organization and its Charter to bring an end to wars  I urge this Assembly to turn away from acrimonious debate over the financial crisis in the Organization  which would serve only to weaken the United Nations still further. I plead  in the name of my country  that we should seek  instead  to strengthen the Organization by overcoming its current difficulties through a spirit of genuine compromise. For  as the Secretary-General observed in his report to this session;""... in a world where the destinies of all countries are almost certain to become ever more closely linked  there can be no substitute for an effective multilateral system in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the co-operative management of global problems."" (A/41/1  pp. 2-3) My delegation holds the view that the report of the Group of High-level Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations presents us with a blueprint for appropriate reform. We would urge the Assembly to accept the Group's recommendations as a foundation upon which we can streamline the Organization.However  we would also urge those who have withheld their contributions fromthe Organization to release them promptly for the stability of the world will be threatened if this United Nations is crippled and rendered weak and un-authoritative.No country or region can guarantee its own security without guaranteeing the security of others. World peace cannot be achieved in circumstances where the globe is only half-safe from threat. If any nation wishes to be secure  it must be ready and willing to share security with all.The framers of the United Nations Charter were deeply conscious of the necessity for the Organization to play an important role in maintaining international peace and security - ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". Chapter VII of the Charter contains a blueprint for an international security system with an enforcement capacity to deter aggression and prevent regional disputes from erupting in armed conflict. It has never been implemented. Yet as we survey the globe  there are incidents of regional conflict on almost every continent; it is estimated that some 150 conflicts have occurred since the Second World War with no less than 20 million deaths.It is staggering to consider that the world is now spending over $1.5 million a minute on arms. It takes just 15 days and 15 hours for world military expenditure to match the amount spent on all aid to all developing countries in the whole of 1983. swords have not been beaten into ploughshares spears have not become pruning-hooks  and nations continue to lift up sword against nation. And nowhere is this more striking than in the fact that for every 100 000 people in the world  there are 556 soldiers but only 85 doctors.It is against this background that we must all welcome the agreement made in Stockholm this September between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries allowing for verification and inspection of military activities as well as observation; for  the Stockholm document removes a great deal of the tension and suspicion associated with these military exercises and is an indication that  given the political will  the East and West can stand together on common ground  encouraging mankind  as a whole  to enjoy a sense of optimism over the future of the world. We must all pray that Stockholm was not a false start but rather a bold beginning on the long journey towards a reduction in conventional arms and  more important  genuine limitation of nuclear weapons.While small countries  such as mine  welcome the relief from tension in Europe occasioned by the Stockholm agreement  we remain troubled that in the absence of global adherence to the principle of the United Nations  we have been forced to protect national security through accumulation of arms and through military agreements with countries equally small and equally disadvantaged. My country  and other countries like mine in the Caribbean  could better have spent our scarce resources on hospitals for our ailing  on welfare for our aged  on education for our young.It is not right that small countries which have experienced a history of exploitation and whose people have been forced for centuries to endure deprivation and suffering should be weighed down with the heavy burden of expenditure on arms at the beginning of their journey to independence.But  we cannot deceive ourselves that small though we are  we have not become the subject of attention by adventurers of one sort or another. The numerous examples of mercenary forces mounted to invade small countries  of political opportunists fomenting disquiet  of unscrupulous drug dealers destabilizing our territories  demand that we should not sit by idly. To meet these pernicious elements  and in the absence of a will within the United Nations to address collective security as envisaged in the Charter  small States have been forced to establish the means for some self-protect ion.But  by diverting scarce resources into security  our economic and social development has been retarded.In 1982  the year after my country took its place as a Member of this Organization  the Secretary-General  in his report  issued a call:""to reconstruct the Charter concept of collective ... peace and security"" (A/37/1  p. 2) in order to meet the need of Governments for:""a workable system ... in which they ... have real confidence."" (Ibid.) Yet four years later we are not even close to achieving confidence in the United Nations capacity for collective security. For the countries with veto power on the Security Council have chosen to frustrate attempts to create the ""workable system of collective security"" (ibid.) envisaged by the Secretary-General and endorsed by this Assembly.The result has not brought benefits to anyone: conflicts have ignited like brushfires on the global map and the super-Powers have become engulfed in the flames as each puts support behind one or other of the adversaries. The cost has been high not only to the people engaged in the conflict  but to the people of the super-Power nations  whose Governments diverted money from their own development and spent it instead seeking positions of primacy over each other.As the representative of a small country anxious to advance its social and economic development and deeply aware that a system of collective security under the umbrella of the United Nations opens an opportunity for genuine global stability  I call upon this Assembly to request the Secretary-General to bring the question of collective security to the attention of the Security Council once again in the hope that the troubled state of the world and the debilitating effect upon all countries  including the super-Powers  will encourage a more productive response.As we survey the globe  who could help but be deeply troubled at the state of the world? In some areas of the Middle East  children no longer have a normal life: their only school is an army  their only playground a battlefield. The war between two neighbors  Iran and Iraq  has been raging  with grievous consequences for both. Surely  the General Assembly and the Security Council can use their influence to bring about a complete cease-fire and a peaceful settlement to the conflict by mediation.Equally  the Assembly cannot be unmindful of the increasing tension in Central America over conditions in Nicaragua. The lives of people have been severely disrupted; there is no longer any routine and each day could be their last. Is that how people should live? Has the time not come for the General Assembly and the Security Council to intervene behind the Contadora negotiating process in order to secure a comprehensive  verifiable and simultaneous agreement to bring true and lasting peace to the area?In the midst of this disturbing scene of human tribulation  we are heartened by at least one attempt to find a solution to problems by peaceful means: The Assembly should welcome the efforts of the Republic of Korea to resolve its differences with North Korea on the basis of a comprehensive unification formula. We would urge neighbors in other regions to turn away from the battlefield and to seek solutions to their differences at the negotiation table.My country lies on the route of the most dangerous traffic that the Western Hemisphere has experienced this century: the drug run to the United States of America. In the process of our being used as a trans-shipment point  some of the cargo has been left on our shores  promoting drug abuse and encouraging crime by the lure of big money.We have all seen the injurious effects of narcotics on societies - the flower of youth emaciated and withered before it has had a chance to bloom   minds reduced to inarticulate cabbages  life snuffed out even before it has had a chance to sparkle. We are all painfully aware of the injury to economic development which is done by drug abuse among the work force in developing countries. Larger and more powerful States cannot sustain the waste of its human resources. How  then  could we in small States  with fewer people  cope with so perilous a problem?But the problem is even more ominous  for last year the International Narcotics Control Board reported that evidence exists clearly linking drug trafficking in many countries with the illegal traffic in firearms  subversion  international terrorism and other criminal activities. Since that report  the situation has deteriorated significantly. Our economic development is threatened from within as our young people are nursed into the habit of drug abuse  while our security is threatened from without by gangsters eager to find trans-shipment points to the United States and unmindful of the extent of the action  including murder  which they must take to secure their ill-gotten gains.It cannot be beyond the capacity of the United Nations to institute mechanisms upon which countries can call for help to rid the world of this all-consuming evil  in this connection  the entire international community should give the strongest support to the proposed international conference on drug abuse and illicit trafficking to be held at the ministerial level next year. But  equally. States Members of the United Nations should give full support to the activities of the Organization in this area.My delegation would suggest that  following upon the forward-looking resolution introduced by South-East Asian countries and adopted by the General Assembly last year  the scope of the Organization's work should be expanded to include the provision to developing countries  upon their request  of help from a trained and capable international team to investigate and detect drug traffickers within their territories and to police their territorial waters effectively. This suggested new activity could be accommodated through the Central Training Unit for Law Enforcement Officers  which the United Nations has operated since 1972. I would add that the biggest contributors to that Unit should be those countries which are the largest markets for these drugs. For  while we acknowledge a responsibility to be watchful for dangers to all mankind  small countries should not be expected to pay for the eradication of evils bred in the societies of larger and richer States.Drug traffickers respect no boundaries  and the harmful effect of drug abuse does not question the nationality  ideology or ethnicity of its victims. All our countries have a vested interest in aborting this foul activity. To that end  I call on the General Assembly to give the Secretary-General the mandate to create a global plan to eliminate progressively illicit production of narcotic drugs wherever it occurs. Such a program must take account of the need to develop alternative means of livelihood for the large numbers of poor people in developing countries who are used to produce these drugs and who are paid only a subsistence income  while the organizers and distributors in the developed countries grow rich and fat.If we in the Caribbean feel threatened by the activities of illicit drug traffickers  it should also be understood that we feel no less uncomfortable over the rise in the number of nuclear reactors in our hemisphere. Events at Chernobyl have taught us that accidents at nuclear reactors could be as devastating as the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The countries of the Caribbean traverse no vast area and  consequently  the effects of a nuclear accident would waste no time in spreading throughout our region  leaving few  if any  free from harm.It is cause for deep concern to us that while more nuclear reactors are being established in our hemisphere  we have no influence over their number  their locations and the levels of their safety. It is in this context that we must ask: At what point does the placement and safety levels of nuclear reactors cease to be a national matter and become an international concern? Is it when an entire island nation is wiped out? Is it when it is too late to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from dying?We in the Caribbean have good reason to sympathize with our sister States in the Pacific that have been distressed for years over nuclear tests conducted by larger states and the dumping of nuclear waste. We share the deep-seated fears of the Pacific island countries about the long-term medical effects of exposure to radiation and the contamination of the environment  including marine life and food crops  which could be caused by nuclear activity.In expressing our strong desire for the United States and the Soviet union to reach agreement in their negotiations to limit nuclear arms  we are mindful that there is also need for agreement in the international community as a whole on nuclear safety. We are aware that just two months ago governmental experts met at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and settled the texts of two draft conventions in the field of nuclear safety. This is a welcome development and we urge all nations to ratify these conventions as soon as possible.But it should be understood that these conventions meet some of our concerns only part way. For while the treaties would oblige ratifying States to provide early notification of nuclear accidents with possible trans-boundary effects  and also would commit them to endeavor to provide assistance in the event of a nuclear accident  they do not set standards of safety nor do they allow for verification. For a country like mine  a mere 170 square miles  early notification of a nuclear accident would be a meaningless gesture  for the effects of a disaster on a land the size of ours would be immediate and fatal. It is in this context that my delegation would urge all nations to agree to establish within the United Nations system the means of setting standards for and verifying nuclear safety.I come now to terrorism. Here again  while the main focus of this iniquity has been in the developed countries  small States find themselves in a sadly vulnerable position. Some of our countries have become the arena for the conflict of others  and we have been forced to take precautions to protect ourselves. These precautions have not been without cost and  consequently  we have been compelled to divert spending from social and economic development projects to take account of this evil of terrorism.In the Caribbean  our countries depend on tourism  and welcoming visitors from all over the world and offering them the comforts of nature  with which we are blessed in abundance  are important elements in our economic well-being. In this context alone  we cannot afford to treat security at our ports casually. The current situation in the world  in which terrorists strike indiscriminately at innocent civilians demands that we interrupt our own peaceful way of life with extravagant security arrangements for the hundreds of thousands of people who visit our countries every year.No terrorist organization that so wantonly and cold-bloodedly takes the lives of innocent human beings should believe that it enjoys the respect or sympathy of the world. For it does not. Indeed  the actions of such organizations have lost them - and those who support them - the ear of many nations which might otherwise have given their cause a hearing. Terrorist activity directed at civilian targets achieves no good for anyone  and the time has come for the strongest possible action against those who would foster and promote it. I turn now to South Africa. The Secretary-General has observed that: ""Only the total elimination of apartheid will restore peace to South Africa and to southern Africa as a whole"". (A/41/1  p. 12) This observation is an echo of the cries of many South Africans  black and white  who yearn for the day when their country will be free from the repression of apartheid  from illegal imprisonment  from police torture and from State-sanctioned slaughter of young and old alike.Unfortunately  the wailing voice of suffering  rising from the unrelieved brutality of South African jails  has been unable to reach the ears of those in the strongest position to bring an end to this wretchedness of apartheid. Thus  despite the overwhelming support for mandatory economic sanctions against the South African regime  there are those who hesitate to act and others who refuse to do more than pay lip service to abhorrence of apartheid.Yet  in June of this year  the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group whose attempt to negotiate a peaceful settlement in South Africa was aborted by the disdain of the South African authorities  pointed out in their report that if South Africa:""comes to the conclusion that it would always be protected from economic measures  the process of change in South Africa is unlikely to increase in momentum"".That same Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group concluded that if the ncn-white people in South Africa came:""to believe that the world community will never exercise sufficient effective pressure through other measures in support of their cause  they will have only one option remaining: that of ever increasing violence."" If we are to set store by the findings of this Group  the compelling conclusions must be that the Governments which now refuse to impose sanctions on South Africa are helping to keep apartheid alive  and are pushing the non-white people of South Africa into seeking to secure their basic human and civil rights by means of violence and death.The late Prime Minister of India  Mr. Nehru  wrote that:""there is no easy walk to freedom anywhere and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountain tops of our desires"". There should be no mistake about the fact that the black people of South Africa are prepared to walk that valley time and again for their freedom. The choice before the Assembly  and ultimately before the members of the Security Council  is either to help all of South Africa to reach the mountain tops of democracy and justice  or to plunge the country and all its people into a river of blood. My country opts for democracy  we choose freedom and justice for all in South Africa. We urge all others to do the same by agreeing to the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory economic sanctions against this foul and reprehensible regime. We are in the final months of the year which we designated International Year of Peace. But it has not been such a peaceful year  for conflicts have continued unabated in many parts of the world. The signs of a desire for peace came not from Governments but from the spirit of brotherhood and kinship in ordinary people. People who marched against nuclear weapons  people who gave freely and gladly to relieve the suffering of the starving in Africa  people who protested against apartheid. These people rose above the narrow confines of their nationality  ethnicity and sovereignty and  surveying the conditions of other lands  recognized themselves in other peoples.As we stand on the threshold of the twenty-first century  Governments might consider taking a cue from those ordinary people who did so much this year to promote peace. In this regard  we might remind ourselves of the words in the Constitution of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  one of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system ""That since wars began in the minds of men  it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed;""That ignorance of each other's ways and lives has been a common cause  throughout the history of mankind  of that suspicion and mistrust between the peoples of the world through which their differences have all too often broken into war;"".It is in this context that I would urge the Assembly to endorse the proposal of UNESCO's twenty-third General Conference for the proclamation of a World Decade for Cultural Development. R>r we will not erase suspicion and mistrust among all nations until we promote understanding and appreciation among all peoples.The Economic and Social Council has placed a resolution on this matter before the General Assembly for consideration. Let us not close the door on this century and enter the next without some attempt to construct the defenses of peace in the minds of men. Let us put an end to ignorance of each other's way of life  let us take the opportunities for peace into the next century and let us leave behind the failures of war."
"7",322,"AUS",41,1986,"My country  Australia  is delighted to see you  the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh  presiding over the forty-first session of the General Assembly. Coming from a major third-world country  you will bring special sensitivity to so many of the problems with which we shall be concerned during this session.I should also like to express Australia's sincere appreciation to your predecessor  the former Permanent Representative of Spain  for his skill in presiding so effectively over the fortieth session of the General Assembly.Australia has historical reasons to be conscious of the United Nations  of the grave responsibilities that it bears and the great hopes invested in it. Our nation was the first to have a permanent mission accredited to the United Nations in New York. An Australian was the first President of the Security Council. A predecessor of mine  as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia  was President of the Assembly in its third turbulent year. In this forty-first year of the united Nations Australia is reaching the end of its fourth term on the Security Council. It has been a period of high significance  both to the cause of global security and to the effectiveness of the Council itself.There is another good reason why Australians have been more acutely aware than usual of these developments: 1986 is the International Year of Peace  and Australia has invested great resources into making it more than just a rhetorical event. The concept of peace - what it actually is  what obstacles stand in its way  what its maintenance asks of individual citizens - has been very much on our minds in the course of this year. Australians have reacted to the idea of the Year of Peace in an extraordinarily energetic and committed way  and at all levels in our community  from the most junior of school-children to the highest levels of government.It is not hard to think of reasons for this degree of interest. Australia is in an area of the world which seems to be growing more attractive in the configurations of great-Power interests and forces. It is in an area which has known great stress from colonization and the winning of independence. It is in an area which has been - for whatever reason - a major killing field over the past 40 years or so.It is true that Australians have been protected more than most from the worst effects of all this  but they have not been hidden from it. Anxiety about the threat - and even conviction about the inevitability - of nuclear war has been found to be widespread  especially among young people in Australia  as in other parts of the world. This is a terrible heritage to hand on. The early reality of people my age was economic insecurity  if not deprivation. That was bad enough.The experience of young people these days is worse: of terrorism and assassination brought into their homes by television  children starving to death  nuclear explosion and threat. No wonder so many young people are found to be so cynical and pessimistic. They appreciate that - such is the state of the art of war - it needs only the tiniest miscalculation or mistake to set off events that can transform all life into instant archeology. They fear the consequences when distant  arcane and often seemingly trivial disagreement is taken up and used in the kind of ideological  nationalist or economic competitiveness that has set off two world wars so far this century.Australians  like other normal people  yearn for an end to this insecurity. Their Government believes that the multilateral process  and this Organization particularly  offer the most effective ways to deal with the tensions and problems that disturb world peace. This forty-first session of the General Assembly in the International Year of Peace is an opportune moment to measure the durability of those tensions  and the problems and the efficacy of the multilateral way of solving them.The most obviously urgent of these tensions is the instability caused by nuclear weapons. We are on the threshold of developments that could so change the nature of the strategic relationship that it could be many unstable years before the super-Powers are sufficiently confident once more to engage in productive negotiations. The Australian Government believes that it would be highly dangerous to stunt)le - as we risk doing - into the competitive development of ballistic missile defenses and an arms race in space. The discussions last November between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev gave significant impetus to the arms-control process: for instance  the agreement to accelerate negotiations and the call for early progress on matters where there was common ground  such as the principle of reductions in the nuclear arms of the United States and the USSR -appropriately measured - and the idea of an interim intermediate-range nuclear force agreement. Both super-Powers have now put forward a number of detailed proposals for reductions in their nuclear arsenals. Recent meetings have taken place between United States and Soviet arms-control experts. Mow we have the welcome announcement that President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev will meet in Iceland next week.The Australian Government hopes that these developments will pave the way for substantial negotiations and early agreement on deep reductions in offensive nuclear forces. We hope for agreement on practical arrangements and understandings on the issue of strategic defense and the future of the anti-ballistic missile Treaty. We hope that both sides can now show willingness on the issue of a comprehensive test-ban treaty  which the Australian Government considers a most urgent practical step on the road to nuclear arms control. It is in this context of multilateral action and agreement on forms of arms control that I draw attention to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty  which the Australian Government supports as a significant step against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.Australia also wishes to draw attention to the disarmament provisions of the Antarctic Treaty  which has provided the effective manner in which Antarctica has been managed in support of the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. We re-emphasize our commitment to the existing system for the management of Antarctica and  accordingly  we disagree on this matter with my good friend the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Australia was disappointed that the fortieth session of the General Assembly broke with the tradition of consensus on this issue. This was not due to the Consultative Parties  and we hope that that tradition can be restored at this forty-first session. The fact and the implications of nuclear arms understandably overshadow the issue of the trade in conventional arms. In the Australian Government's view  they should not be allowed to do so. Right now conventional weapons are being used to kill people in northern and southern Africa  Afghanistan  Central America and Cambodia.It is a shameful fact that respectable Members of this Organization ace providing the weapons with which Iranians and Iraqis are killing each other. The Australian Government believes that countries contributing to such tragedies should be held accountable for doing so  as with pollution which crosses national borders. Members of the United Nations should agree not to export defense materials to nations engaged in military conflict or where the potential for conflict is high  or where it is likely to be used to suppress human rights. As a first step and at the very least  all States should release more information on their conventional arsenals and transfers  and subscribe to the Secretary-General's standardized reporting instrument on military expenditures so that a more accurate picture of the problem can be built up.More than 80 per cent of the world's military expenditure - estimated at more than $US 900 billion a year and rising - goes on conventional weapons  outlays on conventional arms by developing countries are estimated as being roughly equal to the development assistance they get from developed countries. Brandt  Palme  the Panel of Eminent Personalities  the Secretary-General*  these are among a long list of authorities who have described the contradiction between the demands of militarization and the demands of development; that is  the waste of scarce human  capital and material resources on the arms race. Dwight Eisenhower was a leader in war and in recovery from war. He had good reason as President of the United states to warn that""every gun that is made  every warship launched  every rocket fired  signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed  those who are cold and are not clothed. The world is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers  the genius of its scientists  the hopes of its children. Thirty years later  the Thorssen report on the relationship between disarmament and development still saw the need to point out that the world can choose to pursue either the arms race or a more stable social and economic order. It cannot do both.The logic cannot be challenged. Poverty  hunger and disease are major causes of social and political instability. They cannot be tackled effectively when scarce resources are being used for armaments. Experience shows that unrest leads to government repression in so many countries  leading to the spread of authoritarianism. It is no wonder that  in so many countries  democracy has come to be seen as a luxury  the dessert course of economically sound societies. If military spending is such an obviously important ingredient in the economic problems of developing countries  reduction in military spending is an obviously important ingredient in solutions to those problems.As it is  developing countries particularly face grave economic difficulties from the plague of protectionism in world trade and the complicated and fragile issue of international debt adjustment. The World Bank has estimated that farm subsidies by members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1986 will total more than $US 100 billion. This is a policy that  if permitted to continue  will lead to ruin for agriculture-based economies. This  in the main  means the economies of developing countries  which have to make their way at a time when the international economy as a whole is undergoing difficulty  uncertainty and challenge. The Australian Government has been involved in the recent General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) discussions in Uruguay and elsewhere in the cause of fairer and freer trade. We hope that these discussions will continue so that the issues of trade subsidies  and particularly agricultural trade reform  can be dealt with on a basis which is fair and realistic. We also hope that the spirit that prevailed in Uruguay will continue to be applied to the other great problem for many developing countries: the scope and terms of their formidable debt. I should observe that the Australian Government supports the general thrust of the Baker proposals for solution of this problem. We also support the general approach of the International Monetary Fund to adjustment and conditionality  noting that it should continue to be handled with care. Democratic institutions  sometimes at delicate stages of development  should not be undermined by the process. The economic benefits of conditionality have to be balanced against their potential for causing distress and dislocation. There is not a lot of profit  either for debtors or for creditors  in encouraging economic activity in nations whose export markets are closed off by trade subsidization and other protectionist policies. On both the trade reform and debt adjustment issues  the lessons of the events of 50 or 60 years ago should be ominously clear; the results when nations refuse to co-operate can be devastating.No solutions to great economic problems will work if they do not have the approbation and support of those who are affected by them. No order can endure unless those who are subject to it believe themselves to have a stake in it. This principle applies to other natters on the agenda of this Organization in which Australia has a special interest. It is why the Australian Government continues to condemn the occupation of Afghanistan. It is the reason for our continuing denunciation of Viet Nam's occupation of Cambodia and the atrocities committed in Cambodia by the leadership of the Khmer Rouge. Human freedoms and the agreement of the governed are at the heart of the divisions between the people of North and South Korea. The United Nations once went to war over these divisions. It seems only sensible that  by admitting both North and South Korea  the United Nations should promote the contact and dialog that will help heal those divisions.Freedom and the agreement of the governed are highly significant factors in a matter which is of special concern to Australia and our Pacific neighbors: New Caledonia. Australia would like to see New Caledonia join the community ofindependent nations in the South Pacific as soon as it is realistically possible  with a system of multiracial independence which recognizes the rights of the indigenous Kanak people and other long-term residents  and which maintains the support and good will of France - a point which I have made repeatedly to my good friends in the Kanak movement. Australia supports the call by South Pacific Forum countries for re-inscribing New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories  and we and our South Pacific neighbors will work to do so at this session. We believe that it will facilitate progress towards self-government and independence  through constructive dialog with all parties involved  including the French Government  to be reviewed regularly by this Organization.Freedom and participation are central also in two issues which concern Australia because of their capacity to threaten international peace. I refer to the continuing and deteriorating situations in South Africa and the Middle Bast. The Australian Government believes that the system by which South Africa is governed represents precisely that which the United Nations was designed to oppose; institutional inequity  injustice  violence  oppression and discrimination  it is surprising  therefore  that the South African situation has not been treated in all the statements made by members at this session so far as what it really is; a threat to fundamental United Nations values. The Australian Government's disgust with the system of government in South Africa and that country's continuing illegal occupation of Namibia is well known and needs no explanation here. We genuinely want to see apartheid eliminated quickly and peacefully before it plunges the region  and areas beyond  into wider conflict. Australia and other Commonwealth countries have tried to persuade South Africa to set such basic reform in train  but without success. We believe that the United Nations should set up a mandatory system of concerted and coherent sanctions which would pressure South Africa into real reform. Certainly those Members that cannot or will not adopt sanction policies should refrain or should be discouraged by this Organization from taking commercial advantage of those who can and will.Already in this debate we have heard expressions of hope that some progress might be made in 1987 towards finding a solution of the intractable problems of the Middle East. As a country which has drawn new settlers from diverse parts of the Middle East  which contributes to United Nations peace-keeping efforts  which in simple human terms has not failed to be touched by the plight of refugees and the results of conflict and terrorism  Australia shares this hope. Progress can be made only if compromises and accommodations can be reached which take into account the rights and aspirations of all those involved.The late President Roosevelt saw the United Nations as a replacement for exclusive alliances  spheres of influence and other failed expedients. At the time  on the one hand stood the untrammeled influence of the victorious Powers and  on the other  the dispossessed. It fell to the United Nations to try to fill the vacuum of authority between them. There are many who would say that that pattern has not changed in any substantial way. Certainly  the Australian Government sees the Organization as the only viable alternative to the authority that prevailed previously  very often to the great detriment of huge numbers of humankind - the power of the prevailing empire or State. Yet  despite this  and despite the fact that the world is at a stage in its history when fewer problems can be solved by national measures alone  confidence in international organizations seems to have lessened. Reliance on unilateral action seems more attractive to some people.The Australian Government has some understanding of the impatience expressed about the United Nations and its operations. We would argue that there is room for more efficient administration of the Organization  less wasteful duplication of function and operation and a more rational decision-making process for its budget. In view of its high mission and the poverty and exploitation against which it is struggling  it is quite wrong that the United Nations should be in any way an example of conspicuous consumption. In view of the high expectations of it in every part of the world  it would be a shame if the United Nations were to degenerate into a broadcasting agency for pointless  meaningless and ultimately useless declarations. Australia is among the vanguard of those who seek to make the Security Council more effective. It should  be allowed to act more flexibly  for instance  to play more of a mediator or preventive role. It should be allowed to work more closely with the Secretary-General. I use the word ""allowed"" deliberately  because it is clear that the Council is inhibited by two factors: the trend that has turned it into a kind of mini-General Assembly and the failure of its permanent members always to remember the greater responsibility that goes with their privileged position. Australia will assist the Secretary-General in his aim of making the United Nations a more effective Organization as energetically and as positively as it can.It would be quite wrong to infer from this  however  that the Australian Government has any sympathy with those who act to diminish the United Nations itself and its various organizations. The United Nations has the firm support of the Australian Government. It should not be allowed to become the scapegoat because individual Members fail to subsume their national interests. As Dag Hammarskjold once said  that is like blaming the storm on the ship. The fact is  that the United Nations is no better or worse than the countries which control its purse-strings. If Member States have cause to quarrel with United Nations procedures or if large nations are frustrated because of the way small nations use the system  the solution is to stay and help the fight for sensible reform  not to walk away from the problem.There are many thousands - even millions - of people who owe their shelter  their food  their schooling and even their survival to the organizations of the United Nations. The United Nations has achieved steady progress on a whole range of practical matters: environmental control  for instance*  conditions of work; literacy  the codification of law  the orderly management of transport and communications. It has been instrumental in winning and protecting individual and national freedoms. It has helped keep the peace between nations. It has promoted in people's consciousness an awareness of the gravity and potential for destruction of the great scourges of humankind: oppression of individuals  poverty and the wastage of resources  the causes of war. It has established and defended a moral climate for the conduct of international affairs. It has become the main platform and protector - for many people  the only platform and protector - of thosewho feel strong as members of the international community but weak when left to operate alone.I am not so unwise as to exaggerate Australia's influence on these matters  but I speak as the representative of a nation which feels strongly about threats to the capacity of the United Nations to maintain and defend the rights of individuals and nations in a just and effective world order. I reiterate the pledge given by the Australian Government at the fortieth session of the General Assembly of active  committed and profound loyalty to the United Nations and its ideals. Our Government feels very strongly that the Organization is in danger so long as it refuses or postpones reform  but it believes equally strongly that there is no substitute for the United Nations in a multilateral system of co-operative management of global problems and the maintenance of world peace."
"8",369,"AUT",41,1986,"When the General Assembly adjourned last year  at the end of its fortieth anniversary session  there was hope that the renewed commitment to the ideals of the United Nations expressed by so many of its Members s would contribute to a rapid restoration of confidence in our Organization  create the momentum for a process of reform  and become a real turning point in the cr is is of the United NationsOne year later  and despite a number of noteworthy new departures  not many of the hopes of the fortieth session of the General Assembly have been fulfilled  and all too many symptoms of crisis remain  not the least of which is what we perceive to be a continuing erosion of the world-wide system of international organizations  and of the process of multilateral diplomacy.We are called upon therefore once again to turn our energies and imagination towards the renewal and revitalization of the world's only global instrument for the maintenance of peace and security  and for its effective and concerted use in addressing a world of continuing political and economic crisis.If the United Nations continues to be in a state of crisis  it is also because many of the principles and objectives on which it was built have fallen into neglect  and not the least among them is the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and the patient search for compromise between nations.We still find an alarming tendency to overstate national power  and national interests have led to an increasing pursuit of unilateral policies by nations large and email. Military rather than political means continue to be used in dealing with world and regional conflicts. Many of the barriers erected against the use of force in international relations after 1945 seem to have collapsed. Thepolitical crisis of the United Nations is therefore also the crisis of an organization created for the peaceful settlement of disputes but faced bymilitarization of world politics.A new and indeed most brutal form of violence has emerged lately  theviolence of international terrorism. More than other forms of violence it attacksthe very fiber of international relations. It is a new scourge of mankind. Itcannot be justified under any circumstances or for any reason. Internationalco-operation to combat international terrorism must be further intensified.In the demilitarization of world politics  the reduction of the increasedlevels of the use of force and military power in world politics  and in the fightagainst international terrorism  the role of the United Nations appearsindispensable.Thus disarmament and arms control must retain the highest priority on the world's agenda. New and radical approaches to disarmament and arms control must be adopted. Many types of weapons  old and new  should be totally abolished. Such a ban  as that applied to biological weapons  for instance  should also eradicate chemical weapons. Deep cuts should be made in the existing arsenals of nuclear weapons. Development of new types of such weapons should be discouraged. Therefore Austria considers the An ti -Ball is tic Missile Treaty  for instance  as a pivotal element in the existing system of arms control treaties. Finally  acomprehensive test ban is required.Outer space should remain an environment preserved exclusively for peacefulpurposes. More areas  such as Antarctica  should remain free of weapons of allkinds. We therefore subscribe to the philosophy of creating nuclear-free zones.**Mr. FERM (Sweden)  Vice-President  took the Chair.The summit meeting between the leaders of the Soviet union and the united States to address questions of this magnitude  announced just this morning  has universal support. Its importance for an easing of tensions and for the preparation of new and substantial disarmament and arms control agreements can hardly be overstated. We trust that the combined wisdom of President Reagan and Secretary-General Gorbachev will not disappoint the community of nations.On 4 November Foreign Ministers of 35 nations  including the United States and the Soviet Union  will convene in Vienna to open the third follow-up meeting of the Conference cm Security and Co-operation in Europe.This Conference  over the past years  has established a useful regional framework for constructive dialog and agreement  comprising all areas of East-west relations-  economic  cultural  political  humanitarian and military.Its excellent past record is due not least to the fact that the conference offers equal opportunities for nations  large and small  to participate. Neutral and non-aligned nations of Europe have found an increasingly useful role in this context. The positive and substantive results of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  which ended only a few days ago  augur well in this regard. The Vienna meeting should in our minds  therefore  be a starting point for a new era of co-operation and mutual understanding in  but also beyond  Europe.Three international conferences held this year  one of them in Austria's capital  have provided one single lesson: the South African Government can only avoid further escalation of violence and bloodshed through a dramatic and definitive reversal of its policies. We do not feci  unfortunately  that South Africa has come to read the writing on the wall.Therefore  the determination of an overwhelming majority of States Meters of this Organization  not least of which are the Western industrialized democracies  to adopt further sanctions as a last peaceful means of pressure for change  is growing every day.Austria remains firmly committed to the cause of the freedom and dignity of the peoples of southern Africa. We shall not hesitate therefore to participate in further international efforts to dismantle the heinous system of apartheid and to win freedom and independence for Namibia. In abolishing apartheid  and in winning independence for Namibia  the United Nations has an indispensable role spelled out not least in Security Council resolution 435 adopted as long ago as 1978. Here  as in many other regards  the United Nations has made important contributions to thesearch for peace in the world.More than once the United Nations has contributed to the painful search for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Resolution 242 (1967) constitutes to this day the most widely recognized framework for a peaceful settlement. United Nations peace-keeping operations continue to play an essential role in the Middle East. But the peace-keeping and the peace-making potential of the United Nations in this region has never been fully exploited  and it seems particularly neglectedtoday. It is from the United Nations that some of the most elementary principles for a just and durable solution have emerged - such as the right of all States to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries; the unacceptability of the acquisition of territory by force; and the need to recognize the national rights of the Palestinian people and to give its representatives  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  their place at the conference table.In this context the idea of holding an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations has been gaining ground. Austria - as it did as long ago as 1973  when it was a member of the Security Council and when the Geneva Conference on the Middle East was established by the Security Council andconvened - supports efforts to promote agreement between the parties on this important step to peace in the Middle East.The war between Iran and Iraq  now in its seventh year  has caused immense loss of human life. Its continuation is threatening not only the political stability but also the economic development of a whole region of the world. Determined measures to end this cruel war are long overdue. We think that as a first step a general and strict arms embargo should be considered by the Security Council. Pending a decision by the Council  all countries should observe such an embargo on a voluntary basis.In our view  the present situation in Central America calls for utmost restraint from all sides. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States must be universal. The principles of peaceful settlement of disputes and non-intervention cannot be applied selectively. Relations between States must be conducted on the basis of international law. At the same time  it is our firm belief that all Governments of the region must fully respect and safeguard the human rights and fundamental freedoms of those who are under their jurisdiction.We share the expectation of the Con ta dor a countries and their Support Group that efforts made by Governments to arrive at political dialog and national reconciliation will do much to create pluralistic democratic societies in Central America and will substantially increase the likelihood of a successful outcome of peace initiatives. A Contadora regional peace treaty  signed and implemented in full by all the countries concerned  offers the best hope for peace and for lasting respect for the security and sovereign rights of all the nations of Central America.On the other hand  over the past years democracy has been on the march in much of the great continent of South America. Thus  the proclamation of new states of emergency and the taking of political prisoners constitute regrettable anomaliesthat should be rapidly relinquished.Peace in South-East Asia remains an elusive goal. The unresolved problem of Kampuchea  its occupation by foreign troops  appears to be the major obstacle dividing the peoples of the region. In Austria's view  only a political process based on the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the International Conference on Kampuchea can lead to a just settlement.Almost seven years have passed since the military intervention in Afghanistan. We remain deeply concerned about the continuing occupation of this traditionally non-aligned country and the violation of its sovereignty. The suffering of millions of refugees must not be forgotten. Any solution must enable these refugees to return to their homes in safety and honor. We therefore support the efforts of the Secretary-General's Special Representative in his search for apolitical settlement.The situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the world presents acontradictory picture today. Arbitrary executions  torture  the denial of fundamental rights  racism and intolerance still prevail in many countries. Whatis lacking today is not international instruments but their faithful implementation. Let us  all together  co-operate to reduce the gap between norms and reality. Efforts of the United Nations and of regional organizations  such as the Council of Europe  should be supported.Striking imbalances still prevail in the world economy: The growth rate in many developing countries - with few exceptions - lags significantly behind their population growth. Commodity prices are at their lowest level historically since 1945. Most commodity agreements seem to be close to collapsing. The debt problem weighs heavily on many developing countries  especially in Africa and Latin America.This situation contains dangerous prospects for global economic growth. In view of the considerable decline in net capital flows to developing countries  we are faced with the serious  and  I would add  shameful  anomaly that at present a net flew of financial resources on the order of many billions of United States dollars annually - the exact figure is a subject of controversy among experts  but this is the order of magnitude - is taking place from the South to the North  instead of from the North to the South. Living standards in many parts of the world actually continue to decline.Thus  it is more than obvious that many development concepts of the past have failed. A fundamental rethinking of the many interrelated issues of development  trade and finance is required. And many issues that appear technical or purely economic on the surface are actually deeply political - the debt problem amongst them. Reliance on short-term solutions largely neglecting social and economiceffects in the economies and the social structures of developing countries is therefore a dangerous proposition.Instruments for international co-operation must be strengthened if we wish to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving world economy. In this context thesuccessful outcome of the meeting at Punta del Este - especially the recognition of special  more favorable treatment of developing countries - appears encouraging.After years of stalemate in the North-South dialog the special session on Africa seemed to signal a change of atmosphere. My country will contribute actively towards the implementation of the United Nations ProgramF of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  1986-1990. But the Nor to-South relationship remains the central social issue of our time. New political approaches  based on the principles of equality and international solidarity  arerequired.We must preserve our planet for future generations. Threats to its ecological balance  to the global environment must be met. More resources than before must be pooled  nationally and internationally  to meet this challenge. Let us therefore apply our imagination towards creative approaches  which could include  inter alia  the establishment of a global environmental emergency fund  possibly in the form ofa new ""window"" of the World Bank.Narcotic drugs are a dangerous problem of global proportions. The convening of a world conference to combat drug abuse aid the illegal traffic in drugs is therefore a very timely initiative. Austria will do its very best to contribute to the success of this major event  to be held in Vienna in the summer of 1987.Whether this year's session of the General Assembly will be judged as a success or a failure will largely depend on how we tackle toe Organization's crisis - on how we tackle its crisis - on hew we deal with its administrative and budgetary reform. In this context  the report of the Group of 18 represents a valuable contribution to our debate. Austria believes that the continuation of this process of reflection and reform is essential.A part of this problem - which is of crucial importance for the Organization -seems to be the question of a new mechanism in the area of Program planning and budget. But let us not forget  in all this process of reform  that we vitally need the United Nations as a strong and constructive force in an increasingly interdependent world. An appeal should therefore be addressed to all Member States to meet loyally all obligations flowing from the Charter  in order to strengthen the United Nations.Allow me to say a few words about Austria's relations with Italy. Austria entertains good and friendly relations with this important neighboring country. In this context  the question of the South Tyrol is of special importance. Resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in 1960 and 1961 led  in 1969  to an agreement between Austria and Italy on a new framework for the autonomy of the South Tyrol.""today - this very day - we observe the fortieth anniversary of the conclusion of the Paris Agreement between Austria and Italy  signed by two great statesmen  Alcide de Gasperi and Karl Gruber. This agreement aims at protecting the German speaking population in the South Tyrol. This anniversary should remind us that  notwithstanding the major progress achieved so far  essential autonomy provisions agreed upon in 1969 remain yet to be implemented. This applies in particular to a center-piece of autonomy  the use of the German language in court and in police and civil proceedings  causing continuing and justified concern among South Tyroleans and the Austrian Government.In this regard arrangements have been envisaged some two weeks ago by South Tyrolean representatives and the Government of Italy. They offer hope that final agreement by the Italian Government will follow soon. Our expectations have been further heightened by the recent declaration of Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti that the Italian Government intends to enact all other remaining provisions forthis autonomy as soon as possible.Before concluding  let me pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General. Austria is deeply grateful to Mr. Perez de Cuellar for his untiring efforts in carrying out an often difficult mandate. My country will continue to support him.We gratefully remember the able conduct of last year's session of the General Assembly by its President  Ambassador Jaime de Pinios of Spain.May I say  finally  that a most outstanding representative of Asia now presides over the Assembly. I sincerely congratulate him upon his election and wish him every success. His well-established diplomatic skills certainly assure us that this will be a memorable session of the Assembly in the annals of the United Nations."
"9",440,"BDI",41,1986," Mr. President  may I first join those who have already expressed their genuine pleasure at seeing you preside over our work. Your outstanding dualities will be sorely tested during this session  in which a number of decisions will have to be taken to ensure a future for our Organization. I am convinced that your wisdom  calm and patience will ensure the success of this important session.While congratulating you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly and the fourteenth special session devoted to the question of Namibia  my delegation welcomes the fact that the Assembly should have chosen a national of a country renowned for its devotion to the principles of non-alignment. I can assure you of the whole-hearted co-operation of my delegation.I should like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies of Spain  for his work as President of our Assembly. His term of office  which coincided with the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization  was marked by the onset of a financial crisis which risks shaking our Organization to it foundations unless an appropriate solution is found. It was also a time when we experienced events which were as serious as they were unexpected. Suffice it to recall the natural disasters which occurred around the world  particularly in Africa  and the serious armed conflicts between States Members of our Organization which have tarnished that period  not to mention the problem of terrorism.We are pleased to note that throughout those tragic events which loomed over the international scene the Secretary-General was unsparing in his efforts to seek greater stability  peace and justice the world over. I believe this is the time to pay a well-deserved tribute to him for the many initiatives which he has launched.For some days now we have been hearing a series of analyses offered and themes developed by outstanding orators who have spoken from this rostrum. They have  with clarity  precision and awareness of the gravity of the situation   broached the various political and economic topics of particular urgency.At the united Nations  as in other international and regional organizations in which we are involved  the Republic of Burundi strives to contribute to all deliberations and every initiative involving our commitment to justice and peace. After all  it is the noble duty of the Assembly to inspire hope and find solutions for the various conflicts  wars and other disputes that are  alas  the daily lot of our time. Burundi will strive to make its modest contribution.If we are not careful  our world will find itself on the brink of total conflagration.The first powder-keg is to be found in southern Africa. That part of the African continent is the epicenter of numerous upheavals that have spread beyond the borders of South Africa and Namibia  engulfing the neighboring States. The international community has denounced the scourge that is at the root of this situation and that bears the name apartheid. South Africa is the only country in the world in which the military machine is used almost exclusively for the purpose of harassing peaceful people  incapable of containing the explosive situation that exists within its own borders  the Republic of South Africa is planning and exporting war and desolation in the neighboring countries. It professes and practices the policy of recourse to force.The world  stunned  recently denounced the incursions for the purpose of destabilization by the Pretoria regime into Botswana  Lesotho  Zambia and Zimbabwe. Those acts of aggression have added complication to the covert war it has been imposing on the peoples of Angola and Mozambique ever since they won their independence. No neighboring independent country has been spared Pretoria's armed adventurism The recent intimidating declarations by the Pretoria regime regarding the possible imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions have increased our fears as to that regime's true intentions.To meet this situation of permanent war the front-line countries are compelled to devote considerable resources to self-defense  at the expense of their urgent development needs. The price paid by those peoples to sustain the liberation struggle in South Africa and Namibia has become a crushing burden. Vie take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the courage and determination of the peoples of that part of the world. The international community must redouble its efforts and give further proof of its solidarity by helping to reduce the impact of Pretoria's acts of sabotage.In this context we appeal to the international community to support and contribute generously to the fund set up at the Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries to help the front-line countries resist invasion  colonialism and apartheid.The question of Namibia is the second subject of concern on the African continent. We welcomed with understandable hope the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) establishing the United Nations plan foe the independence of Namibia. For once  those that truly have the power to check South Africa's arrogance and are capable of persuading it to co-operate with the international community joined the ranks of those States that want to see Namibia take its place among free  sovereign nations.However  to the great disappointment of peoples that cherish peace and freedom. South Africa's major political and trading partners have since had recourse to various tactics to delay the independence of the Namibian people. The Government of Burundi has always said  and now repeats that the question of Namibia is one of decolonization pure and simple  that the illegal armed occupation by South Africa and the plundering of the resources of Namibia by that country and its allies seriously jeopardize international peace and security. We have alwaysdenounced  and again denounce  any tendency to analyze and define the Namibian question through the distorting prism of a confrontation between ideological blocs. We must not put the Namibian people between the hammer and the anvil of the of vain East-West rivalry and the ephemeral quest for commercial profit  when what is really at stake is the independence and future of an entire people.The nations of the world will appreciate that the alleged risk of the spread of communism in southern Africa cannot be overcome by the installation of destructive  reactionary fascism.The international community has long been calling for the imposition on racist South Africa of comprehensive mandatory sanctions in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter. We remain convinced that this is the only way of breaking the spiral of violence and initiating genuine dialog among the peoples concerned with a view to bringing about a lasting settlement of the problems of that tormented part of Africa.Notwithstanding our many attempts to deal with the matter  the most recent of which were in Paris last June  in Vienna at the beginning of July and at the fourteenth special session  which concluded its work some two weeks ago  a certain number of countries with special responsibility in the realm of peace-keeping and the maintenance of international security obstinately refuse to envisage comprehensive mandatory sanctions and evade the question of the independence of Namibia. Happily  the position taken by the international public has provided some degree of hope and encouragement.The Government of Burundi reaffirms its total support for the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole  authentic representative of the Namibian people  whose persistence in the struggle compels our admiration. The people of Burundi have no doubt whatsoever that our brother people of Namibia will attain victory in the end.In north-west Africa the just and determined struggle being waged by the Saharan people for the exercise of its right to self-determination and the enjoyment of its other fundamental rights will lead inexorably to victory. It is regrettable that so far the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations recommending direct negotiations between the parties concerned  that is  the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front  have not yet been implemented. However  we welcome the talks  even though only indirect  taking place under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General in consultation with the OAU.Elsewhere in the world the scene is no more reassuring. Certain conflicts persist and are taking on alarming proportions.In the Middle East  the Palestinian people has not yet regained its homeland and is continuing its heroic struggle to achieve self-determination. It is clearly established that the Palestinian problem is at the heart of all the upheavals shaking that part of the world and that until a just and equitable solution has been found for it there will be no lasting peace in that part of the world.In Lebanon  the various protagonists have turned that country into a veritable battlefield. The people of Lebanon too is entitled to peace. It desires only to heal its wounds without outside interference in its strictly internal affairs.Not far from Lebanon  the war between Iraq and Iran has lasted for six years and has already taken a heavy toll in human lives and material damage. The people of Burundi firmly believes in the virtues of moderation  the efficacy of negotiation and the search for peaceful solutions to all disputes between nations. It come again exhorts our Iranian and Iraqi brothers to turn to peaceful means compatible with the Charter of our Organization to put an end once and for all to their present conflict.Just as we preach moderation and concord  we have always refused to sanction invasion and the occupation of any country by foreign troops. The people of the entire world should rather set out on crusades against hunger  poverty  ignorance and disease. The only battles we can admire are those that are waged for the development of nations and for the full development of the potential of the individual.We remain convinced that the crises afflicting Afghanistan and Kampuchea  like the precarious and rapidly deteriorating situation in Central America  would give way to restored normalcy if all States again made it their business to abide by the norms of international law.For that reason we support the efforts of the Secretary-General with regard to the questions of Cyprus and Afghanistan  the talks aimed at the peaceful reunification of the two Koreas  and also the initiatives of the Contadora Group.By the same token  the States Members of this Organization should resolve to keep their defence systems within reasonable limits  establishing a sensible balance between resources used for armaments and those devoted to development; but above all they should avoid the geographical proliferation of nuclear weapons with massive destructive potential. We welcome the convening of the forthcoming meeting at the highest level between the two super-Powers to relaunch disarmament negotiations. We also exhort the other nations with advanced nuclear technology to dedicate themselves to utilizing the potential of the atom exclusively for peaceful purposes and for social and economic development.The imperative need to consolidate peace and stability in order to ensure social and economic development in our countries is undeniable. Indeed  the conjunction of particularly disadvantageous political and economic factors is undermining the efforts of many countries to extricate themselves from the current crisis.Stricken harder than others  the developing countries in general and those in Africa in particular have been compelled to undertake painful reforms to restructure their economies to overcome their economic difficulties and crushing external indebtedness. In this connection  the recent special session on the critical economic situation in Africa  held last May  allowed for detailed discussion of the dimensions of the economic crisis on that continent. It made it possible to establish and adopt priority recovery measures. Burundi  along with other African countries  counts on the support and solidarity of the international community for the implementation of the priority Program for the economic recovery of Africa.Along these lines  the international community must urgently examine the more and more damaging effect of Africa's external debt. Precisely because of the critical economic and financial situation of that continent  it should be given special treatment. For that reason the Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity decided at their recent meeting to pursue efforts to increase general awareness with a view to bringing about the convening of an international conference for the consideration of this particularly alarming issue.Burundi knows  from its own experience  that the task of development involves a slow and difficult process for many developing countries  particularly the most disadvantaged among them. Certain development-related constraints have already severely impeded the efforts of my country. We are referring to our land-locked status  our high population density  the limited development of our human resources  the small size of our market and our weak capacity for financing from within. For all these reasons  we continue to need aid from abroad in order to complete the task we are striving to accomplish within our borders. In view of my country's scarce resources  it is vital that priorities be established. Accordingly  the Government of the Second Republic  headed by President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza  ascribes the highest priority to rural development There is an imperative need for the relaunching of the global negotiations  which are now frozen  so as to achieve a consensus on the establishment of a more just and better balanced new international economic order  one which will put art end to the many elements of maladjustment in the current situation. Today there ia no reliable alternative to the North-South dialog  either for the developed countries or for the developing ones. Therefore it is appropriate at this time to launch negotiations that fit directly into the pattern of the interdependence of our respective States.Our Organization is a useful instrument  tested by time  for the promotion of fruitful dialog among nations. Above and beyond the criticisms - which are not always pertinent but which have the effect of putting the Organization's credibility in question - all nations  great and small  agree in acknowledging the importance of the noble mission set forth in the Charter.Dedication to the ideals of the Organization has often been reaffirmed by all States  particularly at the time of the commemoration of .its fortieth anniversary. We would  therefore be acting in a responsible manner if we gave it all the support it needs  particularly at a time when it is going through the most serious financial crisis in its history.We are grateful to the Secretary-General of the Organization for having initiated a series of arrangements which have made it possible to cope with the crisis for the time being. The General Assembly  for its part  is preparing to consider the report of the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts it entrusted last December with the task of analyzing the ways and means of improving the administrative and financial efficiency of the Organization. My delegation welcomes all recommendations and proposals for reform designed to strengthen our Organization's capacity to carry out better its imperative mission and thus preserve this forum for dialog and the concerting of views  which I hope no one is thinking of abolishing.Together  inspired by the firm determination to consolidate our achievements  we have always overcome obstacles. At this time  once again  history calls upon us  and we do not have the right to fail it."
"10",487,"BEL",41,1986,"At the outset  I should like to extend to Mr. Choudhury my warmest congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am particularly pleased at his election since our two countries maintain excellent relations. The Organization will  I am sure  benefit from his wide diplomatic experience. I am confident that his authority and his great negotiating skill will guarantee the success of our work at this session.I should also like to thank his predecessor  Mr. de Pinies  Ambassador of Spain  for the skillful manner in which he guided the General Assembly at its last session.I take particular pleasure in saluting the Secretary-General and drawing attention publicly to the untiring dedication with which he fulfills the high responsibilities entrusted to him by the international community. I am delighted to see him among us today in excellent health and ready to share in our common endeavor to ensure that the United Nations fulfills its role in the world.The Secretary-General's report to the General Assembly has received the close attention of my Government. He correctly emphasizes the extent to which the interdependence of all States compels us to co-operate ever more closely in order to achieve stronger multilateralism. The ideals of the Organization can only be achieved through such co-operation among all States  which is the responsibility of every State  directly and individually.My country's commitment to international co-operation has been clearly demonstrated in the past. Today  I am convinced that the goals of such cooperation include the strengthening of the United Nations.In this context  ray country attaches great importance to the universal character of our Organization. For example  with regard to the question of the Korean Peninsula  Belgium is in favor of the simultaneous admission of the two Koreas to membership of the United Nations  pending direct talks between the two parties leading to reunification.The Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom  Sir Geoffrey Howe  current President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community  has perfectly described from this rostrum the way in which the 12 members of the Community view international questions of concern to us. I should like to thank my colleague and emphasize that Belgium associates itself strongly with his statement.A year ago the General Assembly proclaimed 1986 the International Year of Peace. That initiative was a response to the aspiration of all people to live in a world in which peace is permanently guaranteed by effective  verified disarmament. But we must recognize that a number of fundamental prerequisites for effective disarmament have not yet been fulfilled. There is still an appalling lack of trust  and without trust nothing concrete will ever be achieved. It seems to me  therefore  that only a gradual approach has any chance of leading to results that will lead to permanent solutions.The Geneva summit in the autumn of last year gave rise to great expectations;the ""spirit of Geneva"" characterized the ensuing atmosphere of growing trust between the two super-Powers. Since then  those relations have had ups and downs  but thedialog continues  and that is the main thing. We hope that another summit will take placein Washington. Seal progress towards agreements on the reduction of forces is possible  beginning with the complete elimination of a whole category of weapons. I am thinking of medium-range nuclear missile  which are of direct concern to my com try.A balanced redaction of the strategic arsenals of the two super-Powers will open the way to greater stability. That goal could be readied without upsetting the balance of power  because such a reduction would simply bring the arsenals down again to their level of some 10 years ago.It is against this general background that we must examine the question ofputting an aid to nuclear testing. Belgium welcomes the progress that has beenmade in the past few months. We follow with interest the proposals that have beenmade on both sides in the area of verification. It seems to us that the climate isfavorable for a resumption of dialog. Belgium has therefore welcomed the Sovietdecision to extend its unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests. However  Belgiumbelieves that a moratorium  even if it were multilateral  would not necessarilyoffer all the safeguards that can be provided only by a treaty signed in due and good form.If  taking into account the real facts of the problem  a total halt in nuclear testing cannot be expected over the short term  there are intermediary solutions within the context of a gradual and realistic approach. The military nuclear Powers  beginning with the two super-Powers  could agree cm limiting testing programs to a minimum. President Reagan said the day before yesterday that he was ready to start negotiating an agreement along those lines. Such an agreement would be accompanied by a commitment to provide all relevant in for nation relating to verification. Such a step  particularly if it were accompanied by on-site inspection and verification - and this seems to be accepted in principle now -would provide valuable information on the reliability of procedures for exchanging seismic data. This would play an essential role in verification of a complete halting of nuclear tests.Whatever the importance of negotiations on reducing nuclear arsenals  arms control has also a conventional dimension which we cannot neglect.Belgium has always followed very closely the issue of conventional arms control  particularly in Europe where  in addition to the negotiations on a mutual and balanced force reduction  which have been going on for years now  we see new prospects that can be explored. We must also increase trust and transparency. The Stockholm Conference has just ended with encouraging results. We welcome those results  but we are still far from the goal. Mich remains to be done before real confidence can be built  for that is the only way to take greater strides towards disarmament in Europe.For this reason the Disarmament Conference in Geneva must continue its work in all earnest and with intensity. For Belgium  the ban on chemical weapons is a priority. Only a universal ban can prevent the possible use of these weapons. Indeed  the world has unfortunately witnessed the use of those weapons in the past few months.Alternative approaches  such as ""chemical-weapon-free zones""  can neverprovide the same safeguards. However  some optimism seems to be justified in viewof the progress made in Geneva. Let us hope the momentum will be strengthenedstill further. We await with interest the concrete proposals from the Warsaw Pactmember states relating to verification. A constructive attitude on the part ofthose countries is a major contribution to the success of the negotiations nowunder way. Belgium will continue to be as active as possible in the Geneva Conference.Here  I should like to express gratitude to the Secretary-General  who over the past year has carried out his task of investigating alleged violations of the Geneva Protocol. His work is an important aspect of the credibility of the Protocol  which in the absence of a complete ban on chemical weapons is the only bulwark protecting mankind from the actual use of such chemical weapons.The convention cm the ban of biological warfare is now the subject of a second review conference in Geneva. My country hopes that this conference will further strengthen the standing of that convention which  despite criticism regarding the lack of appropriate verification measures  is an important instrument against those weapons  which otherwise could rapidly become operational.We are also making great efforts in other forums in addition to our work and the work of this Organization. The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  held at Helsinki  the tenth anniversary of which we celebrated last year  initiated a permanent  process aimed not only at arms control and reduction  but also at safeguarding human integrity and dignity and promoting mutual confidence in relations between peoples.The 35 signatory countries will be meeting again in Vienna on 4 November for a thorough consideration of implementation of the positions agreed on in the Final Act of Helsinki and at the Madrid meeting. Belgium attaches great importance to this work since it includes a full examination of the way in which commitments entered into 10 years ago have been implemented  and an examination of the achievements of several specialized intermediary meetings.The negotiators will also be examining ways and means of improving the implementation of the Final Act  this important instrument. The commitments entered into at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe are indivisible. It will therefore be absolutely indispensable for the negotiators to arrive at a balanced agreement  with possibilities for progress in each and every one of the main fields covered in the Final Act.Peace and security are a necessary basis for fulfilling the aspirations of the individual and for creating a climate in which inter national relations can be directed towards universal economic and social progress. Unfortunately  those ideals are threatened by other factors  no less dangerous than war itself. Recent events force us to strengthen our actions in the area of the environment and human health. Here I am thinking in particular of nuclear safety  deforestation and drug abuse.The Chernobyl accident did indeed evoke a profound reaction in public opinion throughout the world. It directly affected the lives and health of workers at the plant  contaminated the population in the region  and produced negative effects throughout large parts of Europe. It is essential  it seems to me  that international machinery should be devised to respond to the serious concerns resulting from this accident.In the nuclear area  we must arrive at a common concept of security. The activities of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Community on the regional level have increased our information and our evaluation of nuclear safety. However  there is an element of decision-making in the design of nuclear plants that still lies exclusively within national competence.There is an obvious need for international co-operation. As a first step we must agree on a common international approach to the evaluation of risks in nuclear plants and of the possibility of serious accidents. Here  the role of IAEA is of the utmost importance. We cannot accept a situation in which the norms for acceptable levels of radiation in agricultural products  soil and water are purely national and may therefore vary.There has been a crisis of credibility in this connection. The world needs standard norms and measures of exposure. IAEA and other competent bodies must work swiftly to resolve this matter. Lastly  the Chernobyl accident has revealed the need for a better flow of information  in this particular field  an important field  a great effort must be made at the national level  where adequate data should be made available. This should be done at all levels - national  regional and global. IAEA could encompass such a global information structure. Here  I welcome the convention on early notification of nuclear accidents.Problems have arisen on the question of whether this convention should include accidents linked to nuclear weapons or tests. A solution has been found providing that States possessing nuclear weapons should make voluntary notification of accidents not listed in article 1 of the convention. We invite all States to declare their intention to this effect. Belgium attaches paramount importance to this question and feels that all nuclear Powers should make such a statement  because it is the only guarantee for our populations that appropriate measures will be taken whatever the nature of the nuclear accident causing radioactive fallout on their territory.Finally  we must ensure international solidarity in the event of nuclear disaster. In this respect I welcome the prompt action taken by IAEA to draft an international convention on assistance in case of nuclear accidents or similar risks of radiation exposure.I should like to touch briefly on two other problems affecting our environment and health: deforestation and the gradual death of European forests rank high among our concerns.In Europe the death of forests is associated with acid rain. The scientists cannot give a definite explanation of the complex process which leads to the slow death of European forests  but all scientists agree that atmospheric pollution is one of the major causes. Vast regions of central and northern Europe are seeing their age-old forests dying slowly. The effects are disastrous from the standpoint of the ecology and the economy  not to mention human health. That effort is essential at the level of international co-operation. Belgium has lent its full support to the major initiatives taken in the past 15 years to protect the environment. My country will preside over the work of the ""European Year of the Environment""  to be organized in 1987 within the framework of the European Economic Community. At the national level  the Belgian Government continues its work to combat atmospheric pollution.But Europe is not the only continent affected by the disappearance of forests. In Africa  America and Asia tropical forests are now disappearing as a result of human activities. The disappearance of tropical forests is indeed a real threat to mankind. For many years the drought which has struck many countries in Africa has demonstrated the importance of respecting ecological balances.The international community is gradually becoming more aware of this as a result  inter-alia  of the work of the United Nations. This new awareness must now be translated into action.Belgium stands ready to join its European  African and international partners to define a co-ordinated and concerted strategy to combat desertification in which man would be at the center of action. That was stated by the Belgian Prime Minister at the recent Silva Conference in Paris. The elaboration of such a common strategy is the only way to mobilize efficient ways and means to see our forests reborn and to contact desert and famine.I turn now to another issue. The illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse are an international problem which increasingly threatens the general health of the population and undermines society and its institutions. There is a link between drug trafficking and the increase in crime and terrorism  the regression of national economies and the modification of social systems.The international community must fully assume its responsibilities in this area. Most of our Governments have intensified their fight against drug abuse  drug production and trafficking. The international dimension of the problem makes co-operation at the regional and international levels essential.Last June  the 12 member States of the European Community decided to increase their cooperation in the fight against drugs  while ensuring that their actions would not duplicate the work carried out in other multilateral forums.Belgium believes that the United Nations has a unique role to play in this field and welcomes two initiatives taken within the Organization's framework  namely  the draft convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and the proposed international conference on drug abuse and illicit trafficking. My country has approved both initiatives within the framework of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the Economic and Social Council.I have already mentioned another scourge that threatens mankind and which canbe fought only through efficient international co-operation. I refer toterrorism. In recent weeks the horrendous events in Karachi  Istanbul and Parisdemonstrated once again how this criminal madness increasingly threatens us in our daily life.General Assembly resolution 40/61  adopted by consensus last year  unequivocally condemns terrorist acts. This is an important stage in our common fight  in order to contribute to the implementation of that important resolution  I wish to inform representatives that measures have been taken in my country to ratify the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons  including Diplomatic Agents  which was signed in New York on 14 December 1973 and the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages  which was adopted in New York on 17 December 1979.Recent developments show clearly that efforts undertaken by the United Nations must be sustained and increased-  above all  they must be efficiently and actively supported for all states. It is essential that the international community as a whole steadfastly reiterates that no political goal can ever justify resort to terrorism. Our loathing for such actions must be clearly reaffirmed. When I spoke last year on this same issue I raised the possibility of drafting a convention or. the use of booby-trap devices along the lines of the Convention against the taking of hostages. I should like to repeat the suggestion now. Of course my country would also be prepared to support any other proposal to intensify the fight against this scourge.Another issue that I should like to speak on is human rights which directly affect man's ability to live in dignity. A striking example of violations of human rights is South Africa. In his statement made on behalf of the 12 member States of the European Community  my British colleague reflected the horror inspired in us by the policy of apartheid  our greatest concern over the extremely distressing situation in South Africa  and our firm commitment to contribute to the abolition of apartheid in all its manifestations. In the course of this session I shall speak again on this matter  as we did at the recent special session on Namibia. Today I shall comment in a more general manner. This year Belgium is once again a member of the Commission on Human Rights  thus demonstrating the great interest that my country attaches to matters relating to human rights.Aside from the events that took place during the last session of the Commission on Human Rights  I should like to stress some main trends that are taking shape in the United Nations in the field of human rights and to mention paths we should like to see followed.First  it seems to me that our Organization  through its various organs  has almost completed its process of establishing universal norms pertaining to fundamental rights. From now on there is the danger that we would be witnessing exercises of merely refining those norms  which appears absurd when the most fundamental human rights are still being ignored or violated in certain parts of the world. We are therefore of the opinion that the efforts of the international community should now be focused essentially on the implementation of existing norms.I have already had the opportunity to express before the Assembly Belgium's views on what could be an ideal system for maintaining observance of human rights through a universal mechanism  as well as through interactive regional arrangements. We are still far from this  but we would like to emphasize here the need to strengthen international co-operation in the field of human rights. Such co-operation cannot be kept within national boundaries. The international community must address itself specifically to the fate of individuals and peoples. One should be able to draw the line between what would be inadmissible interference in the internal affairs of States  such as intervening their political  social and economic order  and objective concern for international co-operation properly understood.We acknowledge that  universal as it should be  the implementation of human rights requires subtle balances which take into consideration social  cultural and historical elements. Such considerations invite us to be cautious. We do not want to condemn; we wish first of all to understand individual situations. Thatnevertheless implies that  in return the authorities involved should not only co-operate in order to clarify the situation but also agree that wherever a common examination of a situation revealed unacceptable shortcomings  that situation should be remedied. Belgium has always emphasized and encouraged the progress made  rather than tried to highlight remaining flaws.As I have said  Belgium is of the opinion that our Organization must decisively turn to the implementation of human rights. We therefore regret in particular the present financial situation which the Organization is having to face. Indeed  and even if it is only for the time being  various essential bodies dealing with: the implementation of those rights have been silenced. The Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities was not able to meet this year and the Human Rights Committee was obliged to reduce the number of its annual meetings. The share of the United Nations budget allocated to activities in the field of human rights is modest. That sector has been severely affected by austerity measures and retention of such cuts in coming years could very quickly jeopardize the whole system of the promotion and protection of human rights.In the same spirit we wish to maintain and build on the new approaches of the Commission on Human Rights  to the implementation and promotion of rights as reflected in the monographs on forced disappearances  summary executions  religious intolerance and torture.In this connection  Belgium will work to strengthen the institution of special rapporteurs appointed by the Commission to investigate violations of human rights. We will also call for the co-operation of the Governments involved. Indeed  we believe  as does the Secretary-General  that this is the direction in which we should move in future. I have just mentioned the financial crisis our Organization is facing. In his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General declares that it is ; uncertain whether the United Nations will remain solvent until the end of the year. This current session of the General Assembly must therefore take immediate action to resolve the crisis.	fAs the President of the Assembly said in his opening address  one must cut "" bureaucratic waste  redirect expenditure to priority areas and streamline the administration. I might add that one should rationalize and lighten the intergovernmental mechanism  which is the responsibility of Member States and for which the United Nations Secretariat is but a support. The Group of 18 : Intergovernmental Experts has submitted a set of useful proposals to that effect  heading in the right direction.We should also be able to agree on a method of planning and budgeting procedures which would ensure a positive consensus on the budget and on the programs of the United Nations. That would help to avoid a situation in which Member States contributing the largest share of the budget find themselves obliged to abstain or vote against the budget.The agenda of the present session of the General Assembly is indeed heavy. May our work proceed in good faith and with goodwill  without which all dialog will remain sterile  and may we find our inspiration in the hopes of all men and women for peace  dignity and prosperity."
"11",578,"BFA",41,1986,"The election of His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-first session is a tribute to his outstanding dualities as a diplomat and to his country  Bangladesh. It also gives me the opportunity to convey to the President the warmest congratulations of my delegation and to recall that  like Burkina Faso  Bangladesh belongs to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  whose members aspire to the establishment of a better world and of a future of international peace and security. We assure Mr. Choudhury of our readiness to assist him in his difficult task.I wish to reiterate our deep appreciation to the previous President of the General Assembly  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  for his excellent work. His rich experience and profound knowledge of the United Nations were of greeit profit to us during the fortieth session.To the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  we convey our heartfelt appreciation for his tireless dedication to the cause of the United Nations and to the promotion of the Organization  and for his genuine determination to make the united Nations a true instrument for peace and understanding among States  in the face of obstacles of which we all know.A few months ago. Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity met at Addis Ababa. More recently  in September last  the eighth summit of non-aligned countries was held at Harare. Now the world community is in New York for the forty-first session of the General Assembly. These gatherings of outstanding personalities seek but a single goal: to make a diagnosis of the ills of humanity and to find the remedies for them.The traditional convening of the General Assembly bears e special and irreplaceable mark: it enables all the nations of the world  large and small alike  to inform the other members of an international community that we all wish to show greater solidarity of their disappointments and their hopes.We therefore hail the role played by the United Nations throughout its 40 years of existence  a role that has promoted the independence of colonial countries and peoples. During those 40 years it has tried to the best of its ability to be a catalyst of the legitimate aspirations of newly independent States which demanded not only full participation in the solution of world problems but also their fair share of the wealth of the planet.Just as yesterday the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples responded to a historical necessity  the struggle for a new world order based on solidarity among men  justice and equity is required today.The new international economic order we have long called for responds to that expectation. We no longer want an order that establishes a dangerous dichotomy in the world  a face-off between East and West and flagrant inequality between North and South. We no longer want an order that oppresses peoples and supports racism and apartheid. We no longer want an order whose rules  laid down without our consent  lead to the enrichment of some at the cost of the impoverishment of others. We no longer want an order in which laws are applied selectively  according to who is weak and who is strong. We no longer want an order based on a balance of terror an <3 on the arms race  in which we watch  helpless and terrified  as preparations are made for the destruction of the world. Finally  we no longer want an order whose very essence is found in permanent or is is in the economic and political spheres  an order built on insecurity and instability  an order that gives rise to unspeakable human suffering.Hence in all international bodies  we have done our best to bring about a new world system which could make a real contribution to solving mankind's problems.Now  more and mere these actions tend to be seen as childish efforts to realize exotic ideals. The United Nations and its different agencies are subjected to underhand attacks for having dared to lend an attentive ear to our legitimate claims. More and more  there are blatant attempts at weakening and restricting the role of the United Nations system  thus threatening to undermine the principles of sovereign equality and of democratic procedures on which it rests.He were aware that within this institution an underground battle was going on between the old and the new order. But we also held the belief - perhaps illusory -that the basic notions of equality of States  of the right of self-determination  of peaceful settlement of disputes and of non-intervention in the internal affairs of- other States had been understood and accepted by all.Today  there is much talk about the crisis of the United Nations  and of the lack of confidence it causes among States and peoples. But surely this loss of confidence is the joint result of the disappointed hopes of those who have overestimated the real capacities of the United Nations  and the failed attempts of those who wanted to continue to bend the United Nations to their wishes. It may be an Utopian illusion to want to accelerate the march of history  but it is suicidal to try to reverse it.A real danger is threatening the United Nations today. The financial crisis it is going through is due to its failure to avoid the childhood ailment of all government administrations: over-expansion. We recognize that through the years the United Nations has become an enormous machine for swallowing up resources which have gone mainly to pay for an administration whose efficiency has often been questioned. No one could seriously oppose reforms to improve the productivity of this Organization  to increase its effectiveness and to streamline its structuresto make them more efficient. But in no case could Burkina Faso be a party to any action directed not to those aims but to depriving the Organization of its content and substance by diverting it from its basic purposes.The United Nations is not only affected by a financial crisis  it has above all men hit hard by the crisis in international relations. Today  more than at any other time in this century  even more than the 1920s and the 1930s  which were supposed to have been the period of collective security  the law of the jungle reigns and every day is extending its sway. The Charter is being regarded as no more than a piece of paper which can be thoughtlessly torn up without any regard for the incalculable and unbearable consequences. In this game of wholesale slaughter where brinkmanship has become the norm  we should cast a critical glance an the road we have taken  and where we have gone wrong in reaching this impasse where we are hemmed in by social and economic injustice  terrorism  and the individualism run wild of States and communities. Now that we are experiencing the effects of this phenomenon  perhaps we should scrutinize some of the least acknowledged of its causes. Let us first find what responsibility lies with us  who have been christened the third world  just as the Abbot Sieyes two centuries a ascribed the Third Estate as those who had been left behind. A hope was born in the 1960s of seeing a majority of States dissociate themselves from the East-West confrontation and deal with problems in a way that would enable the interests of the international community and of mankind to be defended  preserved and promoted. But that hope has been enmired in the quicksands of the proclaimed solidarities and feverish activities which we have constantly engaged in or promoted in the name of a non-alignment which was firm in its words  but uncertain in its actions. Next we should consider the responsibility of those others who have induced us  sore or less systematically  either through temptation or through pressure to betray ourselves and tie our own hands  in order to serve their own egotistical interests. It is the combination of all of these ills that the United Nations suffers from today.None the less  we still need the United Nations because at the end of this year of 1986 the world is no better than in 1985  in spite of the professions of faith which have adorned this International Year of Peace. More than ever  wars  regional tensions  misunderstandings of all kinds create uncontrollable situations throughout the world. More and more use is made of force or the threat of force  of aggression  occupation  political and economic pressure and interference in the internal affairs of other States. Not a day goes by but somewhere an important principle of the United Nations Charteris violated. This is why disillusionment is setting in. Crisis situations which have taken up much of our agenda for several years are before us once again today. In southern Africa  the hateful system of apartheid  now in its death throes  continues to bully  exploit and murder the people of South Africa  to occupy Namibia illegally and to carry out acts of subversion- aggression and destabilization against the independent sovereign countries of the region. For almost three years now  this system  now under external pressure  has been disintegrating. The moment has come for the international community to take the road indicated by the march of history and impose apprehensive and mandatory economic sanctions in order to bring to repentance a regime blinded by its own fantasies and incapable of hearing the cry of anger of its own people.The adoption of such sanctions will serve as a catalyst to bring about the triumph of the just struggle of the peoples of southern Africa and must help to eliminate apartheid and establish a multiracial democratic society in that region. Burkina Faso will continue to give the liberation movements of southern Africa and the front-line countries  the victims of South African aggression  all support it can.Burkina Faso's position on the question of Western Sahara is well known. Just solutions have teen worked out by the Reads of State and of Government of the Organization of African Unity and have been endorsed by the United Nations. It is important that these decisions be applied as quickly as possible  within the framework of a coHsprehensive settlement of the question. Hence  we welcome the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to encourage the discussions among the parties concerned.In the Middle East  and especially in the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories  the unspeakable suffering of men  women and children  has created widespread outrage which is sometimes reflected in desperate actions.Deprived of their rights  humiliated physically  wounded in their dignity  whether as second class citizens in the occupied territories or as exiles driven out of their own land the Palestinians are all victims of a historic injustice  who have been robbed of their homeland.We reject the notion that the Palestinians should become eternal refugees or foreigners in their own land; as human beings we cannot accept such a moral abdication. Israel  more than any other nation  knows how destructive it is to be without a homeland  and must therefore know that what was right and just for an Israeli yesterday is just and right for a Palestinian today.The Palestinians  under the far-sighted leadership of the PLO  have a right to a homeland. The Palestinians have a right to our respect and to our support. The Palestinians have a right to self-determination and to a sovereign and independent State in their homeland of Palestine. The conviction they feel  the just causewhich they defend and the representation they have themselves  also give then the right to be allowed equality in any discussion concerning them.A fratricidal War continues between Iran and Iraq  two distinguished Members of this Organization and of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Once again  we express our first hope that reason  based on an objective analysis of the long-tern interest of the region  will prevail and bring about an equitable solution to this crisis. That necessarily implies negotiation.For more than 10 years Lebanon has been suffering from instability and war. That country  which formerly was one of the most peaceful oases in the region  is today a land of desolation  where there is no visible hope or consolation for the weeping men  women and children. This tragedy  exacerbated by foreign interference  has lasted far too long. It is time to make it possible for the Lebanese people to regain its coherence and national unity.Asia  in spite of significant economic progress  is still undergoing upheavals. In that continent  too  voracious appetites have transformed certain regions into places of desolation  murders and massacres.In Afghanistan  there is some glimmer of hope on the horizon. Discussions have been held on all sides  and we hope that they will succeed in bringing about solutions in keeping with the sole interests of the Afghan people. While  in principle  Burkina Faso is against any interference  whatever its origin  it cannot accept a situation in which the tragedies of others are maintained and used for purposes of geopolitics and confrontation between the super-Powers.It has been many years since Kampuchea has known peace and internal stability  in that case too  we call for respect for the fundamental principles of the Charter.The division of the Korean peninsula into two parts is a tragedy. The Korean people have a legitimate will to reunification. That reunification must be achieved by the Koreans themselves  in complete independence  without foreigninterference and by peaceful means. Like the General Assembly  which has spoken out and still speaks out in unison in favor of this reunification  we hope to see Korea take its place very soon in the United Nations.Moreover  the National Council of the Revolution  the Government and the people of Burkina Faso greatly appreciate the initiative taken by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that made it possible to hold  from 6 to 8 September  the successful International Conference for Denuclearization of Peace in the Korean Peninsula.Almost everywhere in the world  peoples that have become disillusioned because they have waited in vain for just and equitable solutions to their problems are engaging in desperate actions which  because of their absurdity and their negative effects on international opinion  complicate and even delay their victory. To fight for one's rights is one thing; to sacrifice innocent lives is another.It must  however  be emphasized that while individual terrorism is not acceptable. State terrorism is even less acceptable. The events in the Mediterranean this year as well as the foreign interventions in Central America are serious infractions of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and threaten world stability. International relations at the end of the twentieth century cannot and must not rest on the reason of force instead of the force of reason. Such behavior is a very long step backwards  to a time when international relations were taking their first halting steps.The arms race is one of the greatest tragedies of this second half of the twentieth century. It not only drains energies and enormous resources that could have been used more fruitfully for the development of our nations  but constitutes today one of the most serious threats to mankind. In the past  security lay in the possession of the most sophisticated weapons? but today the best guarantee of our survival is disarmament  particular nuclear disarmament. To envisage winning a nuclear war today is not only Utopian but irrational  because the classical military theories of ""superiority"" or ""balance"" are defunct now that each of the protagonists can destroy the world several times over with the arsenals it already has.Hence  there is only one way out: disarmament. And disarmament depends essentially on the will of the great Powers. Recently  gestures of good will have been glimpsed - for example  a freeze on nuclear tests and more serious consideration of the problem of disarmament. We can only encourage all the Powers  and particularly the Soviet Union and the United States  to continue on that path. We extend our best wishes to those two super-Powers at their summit meeting on 11 and 12 October. We hope that they will be guided by the interests of mankind.For a number of years now there has been a deep crisis in the world economy. All the countries of the world are facing economic difficulties. The situation in the developing countries is steadily and alarmingly worsening. Everywhere people are talking only about low growth rates  indebtedness  insolvency  inflation  unemployment or hunger. The problem of external debt is a basic component of the many problems facing all the third-world countries in their daily struggle against underdevelopment.Indeed  how can countries like ours  with very limited financial resources  overcome famine  drought and illness  set up industrial plants and build roads and  at the same time  transfer resources to the developed countries - that is  borrow in order to repay an external debt and bear the costs of servicing that debt  which continue to increase because of the requirements of the present order? Has not the time come for the international community as a whole to deal seriously with this gangrene? It is Burkina Paso's deep conviction - which it stated during the eighth Summit Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in Harare - that the repayment of debt is not a moral choice of so-called respect for a commitment; it is a concrete question and must be solved in a concrete way.No other continent has been so shaken by these various ills as Africa. The moving spectacle of the disastrous drought and famine that afflicted that part of our planet led to a surge of solidarity on the part of the peoples of the whole world with the effort to save innocent human life. But the problems of the development of sub-Saharan Africa are still not completely understood.The special session of the General Assembly on the economic situation in Africa  which was held here earlier this year  highlighted all the symptoms of the African illness: the drop in the volume of trade  the deterioration of the terms of trade  the increase in interest rates  the instability in exchange rates  the reduction of agricultural production  the indebtedness  the diminution  in real terms  of development aid  the economic stagnation or even regression in many countries. That is a picture of bitter failure  for which the African continent is not solely responsible. For the fact is that Africa has rarely been the master of its own development: Africa's development has almost always been the brainchild of persons who have had and still have a very doubtful understanding of our profound being. So far  Africa has been content with being a passive consumer of products and ideas coming from outside the continent. Therefore  another strategy is required  which means breaking with the practices of the past.In this connection  President Thomas Sankara stated the following from this rostrum during the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly:""It must be proclaimed that there will be no salvation for our peoples unless we turn our backs completely on all the models that all the charlatans- of that type have tried to sell us for 20 years. There can be no salvation for us unless we reject those models; there can be no development without that break"". (&/39/BV.20  p. 3)That awareness has  since 4 August 1983  led the people of Burkina Faso to understand that the ""salesmen of happiness"" were in fact nothing but sad peddlers  going from door to door selling systems that really did not meet our needs and our realities. That is why Africa  that continent of hope  in two decades because the backyard of Western shops and retailed on the sidelines of a world that was being built without it.To be sure  the Africans have done suck in 25 years - much more than had been done in almost 100 years of colonization. But the question remains of who profited from this development when the fact is that the African populations have become poorer. The battle waged by Burkina Faso since 4 August 1983 has been precisely aimed at eliminating the obstacles and the underlying causes of its underdevelopment. The former Upper Volta  as everyone knows  reflected  in an astonishing way  all Africa's ills  characterized essentially by: chronic malnutrition  infant mortality of more than 180 per thousand  life expectancy of barely 40 years  school attendance of 14 per cent  one doctor for 50 000 people  and a gross domestic product of approximately $100.The revolution of 4 August 1983 is aimed above all at mobilizing the people  at restoring their confidence so that they can be able better to share their own destiny despite a hostile and difficult natural environment.The road leading our people to fulfillment of their development objectives is a long one. Day by day  the struggles that we win as well as the defeats that we suffer  provide increasing evidence that victories can be won against hunger  disease  ignorance  servitude and humiliation. For that to happen  the masses must find the necessary confidence to transform their own future around clear and precise goals.Some of our achievements are worth mentioning as examples which could benefit the international community. In the area of health  the success of the ""commando vaccination"" program exceeded expectations. With the assistance of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEP)  we were able to immunize against the most common infant diseases - meningitis  measles and yellow fever - in a matter of 15 days more than 2.5 million children between the ages of 7 and 14  thus providing a favorable background for our expanded vaccination program. The operation called ""one village  one primary health care unit""  allowed us to provide all our 7 500 villages with a primary health unit and to train approximately 15 000 village health workers.In matters of education  school attendance increased to 23 per cent  thanks in particular to the efforts of the people  who built new schools in record time. Moreover  within the framework of a literacy campaign  more than 31 000 leaders in 4 500 villages learned to read and write in their national idioms. Almost 50 per cent of those people will be assigned to literacy tasks.In the field of ecology  the struggle against desertification in my country has reached extraordinary lengths and pervades every aspect of the life of the Burkina people. More than 500 000 trees have been planted and we expect a success rate of at least 60 per cent. Special emphasis has been placed on the construction of dams and reservoirs. Those achievements have raised the volume of reservoir-water from 8.7 million tons in 1983 to 302.4 million tons in 1986  which  together with improved rainy seasons  should allow us to achieve food self-sufficiency in the years to come.Finally  in the area of housing  in addition to low-cost housing  it has been possible to make available to our people 62 000 plots of land in 1983 up from 60 000 in 1960  the year of our independence.To consolidate and increase those achievements Burkina Faso has just launched  its first 5-year development plan which should inject into the economy 630 billion CFA francs  or approximately $1.8 billion between now and the end of 1990.This plan  whose main goal is the restoration of the base of our economy that had become distorted by years of natural disasters and mismanagement  will give rise to sufficiently bold action to give a new dynamic imprint to the rhythm of growth of that economy.Strengthened by the recommendations* and conclusion? the special session of the United Nations on the critical economic situation in Africa  Burkina Faso intends to succeed  through this plan  in setting up an independent and self-sufficient national economy in which agriculture and livestock  defined as ""the driving force of our development""  will be the backbone.The efforts that we have just described are to be placed within the more general framework of the struggle of people for a world of dignity and peace. In this regard  the United Nations still has a role to play because mankind is a whole and all of us will survive or perish together.In spite of the commotion caused by events in the world  we shall maintain our conviction that the worst does not always happen  and that the masses are the ones who make history. The injustices and the evils of the past disappear. What remain are the values and the people who nurture the idea of what is just and beautiful and work to implement it.The ideals of equality  fraternity and peace reflect the requirements of our spirit. We call them aspirations.We in Burkina Faso  since the establishment of the National Council of Revolution  have constantly proclaimed and demonstrated this willingness for peace and co-operation with all countries of the world  and especially those in the West African subregion. We are struggling for our development  which is possible only in an environment of peace  and nothing would lead us to threaten that or to jeopardize it because we are neither negative nor suicidal.I should like to repeat here this willingness  because we believe that it is in keeping with the concept of respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and for the promotion of friendship and understanding among peoples. Thus  and only thus  shall we build a future of peace and happiness in keeping with the aspirations of our peoples."
"12",621,"BGD",41,1986,"Mr. President  this is a most gratifying moment for my delegation and personally for me to see you preside over this Assembly. May I express in this connection our profound satisfaction and pride. I have not the slightest doubt that your wisdom and skill and your long and varied experience in diplomacy would enable you to guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion. I offer my sincere thanks to all our friends who have reposed their confidence in you by unanimously electing you to this high office.It is an honor and privilege for me and my delegation to participate in the forty-first regular session of the United Nations General Assembly. I bring you the warm greetings of the people and the Government of Bangladesh. I join my other colleagues  in conveying our gratitude to your illustrious predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jaime de Pinies for his skillful and efficient conduct of our work during the last Assembly. We were impressed by his vast knowledge  prudent counsel  and informed guidance.We commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts in upholding the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. His report  which we have studied with great interest  will make an important contribution to our work.The United Nations  as a unique edifice of peace and justice  symbolizes our collective wisdom. Born out of the ashes and ruins of the Second World War  its Charter impels us to speak against hunger  malnutrition and disease  to speak for human rights and freedom  and  above all  to speak of peace and security. It seeks to order international relations based on a set of principles and to establish a new concept of international morality which prevents force from dictating the issues in a conflict between nations. Most of all  it makes for a single global village composed of a multitude of nations  enclosed in blissful interdependence  which is shared both by the powerful and the weak  the rich and the poor. It has stood the test of time  as we recall our celebration last year of the fortieth anniversary  in recognition  perhaps  of our 40 years of freedom from a cataclysmic global conflict. It has also stood the test of acceptance with its membership being virtually universal. Whatever doubt that one may have about the efficacy of the United Nations it has far less to do with its role per se in international relations  than to do with the attitude of those in doubt. It is not so much a crisis of confidence in the United Nations; rather it is a crisis of political willTo us  the United Nations remains the conscience-keeper of humanity. We have a constitutional commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter. Our record so far in the United Nations bears witness to this commitment. Our policy speaks for balance  moderation and strict adherence to this principle. It is self-evident that conflict is dysfunctional  while co-operation among nations leads to mutual enrichment. Our interaction on the international plane is reflective of this perception of ours.In a regional context  we have been making relentless efforts to promote peace and stability in South Asia through the creation of a climate of goodwill  trust and understanding. We had initiated in 1980 a proposal to create a framework for co-operation in our region. Sincerity and earnestness of approach of the countries of the region have led to a fruition of this initiative. The first ever summit-level meeting of the seven South Asian countries  namely  Bhutan  India  Maldives  Nepal  Pakistan  Sri Lanka and Bangladesh  was held in our capital  Dhaka  last December. The Summit formally launched the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC)  which is an institution geared to the promotion of functional co-operation in a number of specific areas identified for the purpose. SAARC represents the region's testimony to the principle of good-neighborliness. It is our earnest hope that the present level of co-operation will continue to be strengthened and diversified for our common benefit.A paramount purpose of the United Nations is the maintenance of peace and security. Continued accumulation of sophisticated weaponry threatens to render this goal unattainable. We are convinced that disarmament is a moral imperative in the nuclear age. We have consistently advocated meaningful negotiations between those States that have acquired the capability to procure weapons of mass destruction. It is our hope that such negotiations would continue so as to advance the cause of disarmament in an effective manner in the greater interest of global peace.We have consistently advocated that the financial and other resources of extraordinary magnitude that are being devoted to the acquisition of armaments should be redirected towards the elimination of global poverty. It is with deep regret that we note that the international conference on disarmament and development  which could have made advances possible in this direction  will not be held this year.The oldest and perhaps one of the most important questions before the United Nations has been the crisis in the Middle East. As of today  there has hardly been any breakthrough in the form of an initiation of a genuine peace process  despite there being a number of significant endeavors to this end. It is self-evident that the Palestinian question is at the core of the problem. The land which has always been the homeland of the Palestinians is now occupied by a people alien to them. Israel was implanted in the heart of the Arab world  uprooting the Palestinians from their native land. Therefore  so long as the inalienable rights of this people are not restored  no lasting peace can possibly be achieved in the region. Acceptance of this simple truth is a sine qua non for any peace that is meant to endure.It is our firm conviction that the problem in the Middle East can only be solved on the basis of a comprehensive plan which must be contingent upon total and unconditional withdrawal of all Israeli forces from all Palestinian and Arab territories  including the holy city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif  and the Palestinian people exercising their right to national self-determination.Such a peace plan was embodied in the set of principles agreed to by Arab leaders at the twelfth Arab summit held at Fez in 1982. These principles complement the resolutions of the United Nations concerning the question of Palestine. The Palestine Liberation Organization being the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  initiation of any peace process has to take place with their full participation on an equal footing with all other parties. Our support for the Palestinian cause has always been unswerving and unequivocal. We have always condemned the continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories. We shall always stand by our Palestinian brethren in their just struggle.South Africa is up in flames and we continue to witness the most flagrant disregard of civilized human norms and values. This reprehensible policy of apartheid pursued by the racist Pretoria regime must totally be eliminated. At a time when heroic protest of the South African people is being met with an unprecedented degree of harassment  intimidation and persecution  the world cannot afford to sin by inaction. The plaintive cry for freedom that emanates from that unfortunate land can no longer go unheeded. The evil that is apartheid must be dismantled  and now.I reiterate the firm commitment of my country to the cause of the oppressed people of South Africa. We strongly endorse that comprehensive mandatory sanctions  as provided in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  must be applied to South Africa without any further delay.It is over 20 years since the Mandate of South Africa over Namibia was terminated by the United Nations. Yet the Pretoria regime continues to maintain its stranglehold over the Territory and its people in blatant defiance of numerous resolutions and decisions of the United Nations. It is for us to consider how this barbarous regimes could spurn the international opinion and pursue unchallenged its evil policies. It is essentially a moral issue  that is  whether to resist such an evil force or to sustain or even tolerate it  directly or by proxy.We pay tribute to the heroic people of Namibia for their courage and determination. Theirs is a struggle which remains and will remain  ever forceful  undaunted  and relentless. We also salute the leadership of the South West Africa People's organization (SHAPO)  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  for providing unwavering leadership to the people of Namibia. Let me record once more our unswerving solidarity with the struggling people of Namibia in their just struggle for freedom  liberty and human dignity. Bangladesh  through its membership of the Council for Namibia  will continue  as always  to play an active role in the promotion of Namibian independence.We firmly believe that the only acceptable basis of a lasting settlement of the question is the United Nations plan  as contained in Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978). The International Conference for the Immediate Independence of Namibia  held in Vienna last July  had also expressed  in the most categorical terms possible  the conviction that the United Nations plan constitutes the only internationally accepted basis for the settlement of the question. The fourteenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the question of Namibia has endorsed the Program of Action on Namibia formulated by the Conference. It is  therefore  imperative that efforts should be redoubled to implement the Program of Action so that the independence of Namibia could be ushered in within a definite time-frame.We are concerned over the continuation of a fratricidal war between Iraq and Iran causing death  destruction and untold sufferings. It has threatened the univ.y of the Islamic world which Muslims everywhere hold dear to their hearts. We take this opportunity  as a member of the Islamic Peace Committee  the issue yet another appeal to these two brotherly Islamic countries to respond positively to the various peace initiatives. For our part  we shall continue our endeavors to put an end to this tragic conflict. The ongoing efforts  both within the framework of the United Nations and without  need to be intensified and a co-ordinated action be undertaken. The efforts of the Secretary-General in this respect are laudable. We would like to assure him of our continued co-operation.Our principled position on the Afghanistan and Kampuchean issues are based on our unfailing commitment to the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and those of the Non-Aligned Movement. These principles categorically reject use of force  or the threat of its use  and armed intervention or interference by one State in the internal affairs of another. Peace and confidence in these regions can only be restored if all parties to the conflict adhere to the International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States  particularly the principle of the right of peoples to freely choose their own form of political  social and economic systems. It is in this context that we have consistently urged the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea so that the peoples of those countries are free to determine their own destinies.We are dismayed and concerned at the lack of progress in the inter-communal talks between the Turkish and the Greek-Cypriot communities in Cyprus. Bangladesh supports the independence  territorial integrity  sovereignty and the non-aligned status of Cyprus. Any lasting solution to the problem must take into account the legitimate aspirations of both the communities. We have called upon them  therefore  to engage in meaningful discussions in order to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution that would enable them to live in honor and dignity within the framework of a federated Cyprus. In this connection  ray delegation will continue to extend its fullest support and co-operation to the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices in reaching a negotiated solution to the problem.The situation in Central America continues to be tense and volatile. ' We are concerned over the apparent lack of progress in diffusing tension in the region. A process of constructive dialog amongst the parties had indeed been set in motion about four years ago by the Contadora Group of countries with a view to creating an atmosphere of trust  reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. The Contadora process provides the much-needed framework for peace and co-operation among the countries of the region so as to avert further deepening of tension and recourse to military solution to problems. It laid emphasis on the spirit of negotiation in a regional context in a bid to isolate the issues from extraneous political influence. The draft Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  being based on shared perception and mutual accommodation in a regional context  has been the fruit of a series of intensive negotiations among all the parties concerned. It has been acclaimed as the single most important initiative aimed at bringing in peace in the region. It should  therefore  be allowed to take a decisive course with the full support of this Assembly.Bangladesh is of the view that the creation of zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world will contribute to global and regional security and stability. As a littoral State  therefore  we attach great importance to the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean region. We support the early convening of the United Nations Conference on the Indian Ocean in Colombo and  to this end  we participate actively in the deliberations of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean.On the economic front  global developments over the past year have been serious enough to give rise to widespread concern  both with regard to its management and future. The growth in world output fell by one third last year ascompared to the previous year and the growth of world trade was a meager one third of 1984. The sharp rebound in 1983-84 of the largest economy entered a critical phase by last year. Its performance slowed down significantly and its record budget deficit continued to grow. So did the performance of a number of other important economies. By the middle of 1985  sustainability of the growth process its if became a matter of deep concern. While the largest economy lagged in performance  no new growth poles emerged. Rather  the opposite happened. Deflationary policies pursued by a number of important developed countries constrained the overall development climate.The slow-down in the growth has been costly and came at a particularly difficult time for the developing countries  most of which never really recovered from the recession of the early 1980s. The 1986 trade and development report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) observed:""Large parts of the developing countries are still registering regression rather than advance  with falling levels of per capita output and consumption as well as depressed levels of investment. In many of these countries unemployment is high  living standards are declining and social services are being cut  often at the expense of health and education.""The combined per capita income of the developing countries  excluding two major countries among them  declined for the fifth consecutive year in 1985 and fewer than 49 countries  with a population of 700 million  most of which are among the least developed  experienced zero or negative growth rate of their real gross national product (G'jP) per capita in 1985. If the present trend continues the per capita GDP of the developing countries in 1990 will be barely above the 1980 level.A critical concern in this situation faced by the developing countries has been the ever-weakening price for their primary commodities  on which the vast majority of them  particularly in the least developed ones  are overwhelmingly dependent. The low commodity prices have been extremely damaging to their export earnings and to their growth. At the same time  the deflationary environment has brought about a resurgence of protectionism  on the one hand  and progressive erosion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) principles and of the arrangements preferential to the developing countries  on the other. The impulses of growth in 1984 had encouraged many of us last year to hope that this would develop into a momentum. Unfortunately  such expectations were nullified by the negative features as manifested in persistently depressed commodity prices  historically high real rates of interest  and crippling debt service payments. To compound it all  there has been reverse transfer of resources  from the developing to the developed countries  since 1983. At the same time  private foreign direct investment in developing countries fell significantly. This reverse flow of resources threaten to cripple not only the development  but the future prospect of the developing countries as well  unfortunately  there has not been any significant attempt to relieve the decline in private flows by official flows of resources. The International Development Association (IDA)  on which the low-income and the least developed countries depend heavily  saw a sharp reduction in its seventh replenishment  even in nominal terms. The level of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) replenishment also offered no consolation.Have we ever considered the magnitude and the depth of human sufferings  or of the lost potentials  as a result of these unwelcome developments? Have we ever given a thought to the fact that the adjustment measures which more and more developing countries are being forced to undertake are also undermining their growth and development? The situation in the least developed countries  two thirds of which are in Africa  remains particularly desperate as they continue to be afflicted by stagnation or decline in income ana growth. They are the hardest hit by weak commodity prices  and their vulnerability to external factors remains overwhelming. Their socio-economic and basic infrastructure remain virtually rudimentary or non-existent  under severe difficulties  they had to incur more debts. The total outstanding external debt of all the least developed countries increased from $3.3 billion in 1974 to some $30 billion a decade later. The impact of this debt is far more severe than its absolute size indicates. Their difficulties are further compounded by their inability to attract investment from private sources. The serious inadequacy of resource flows to those countries is illustrated from the fact that their average per capita resource inflow was only $26.3 as compared to $30.2 for all developing countries. Given the vulnerability of these countries  concessional and grant elements in resource flows to these countries remain highly important. I regret to observe in this context that in some cases  for instance in my country  Bangladesh  concessional and grant elements of external assistance have recently shown a decreasing trend.This is an untenable situation. For the sake of global peace and progress  concerted efforts must be undertaken to redress the difficulties and to promote development. It is in this context that my delegation fully supports the Committee for Development Planning recommendations for doubling the flow of development finance to the developing countries. We believe that it is an imperative precondition for reactivating those countries. It is also vital to secure the eighth replenishment of IDA at a significantly higher level - The donor commitments made in the context of both the mid-term global review of the Substantial New Program of Action and the recently concluded united Nations special session on the critical economic situation in Africa must be fully implemented within agreed time-frame. The World Bank lending should be increased to the range of $45 billion to $50 billion in 1986-1988 and the negotiations for a general capital increase the World Bank should be effectively pursued without delay. At the same time  the lending capacity of the regional development banks should be enhanced.It is no less important that a favorable situation must be created for increased trade from the developing to the developed countries. In this regard  immediate action should be taken for stand-still and roll-back of protectionist barriers to trade. My delegation welcomes the agreement reached in Punta del Este and hopes that further liberalization and gradual elimination of all trade barriers by developed countries will be the over-riding objective of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII) should be approached constructively  particularly for finding effective and fair solutions to the commodity problems.My delegation believes that in the complex and difficult economic situation that confronts our global community today  nothing is more important than to establish an international consensus for global development. This calls for seriousness of intent to pursue consensus agreements established by this body and in other multilateral forums. My delegation recalls with regret that the consensusresolution 34/138 on the launching of the global negotiations still awaits an effective follow-up. We must also be able to discuss seriously substantive proposals from all sides. My delegation continues to hope that the proposal of the developing countries for an international conference on money and finance for development will elicit a serious response from our partners in the developed world. We are encouraged by the greater awareness now that without the necessary reforms and readjustments in the international monetary  financial and trade fields  the foundations for global development during the remaining years of this decade and in the next decade will not be laid. Above all  multilateralism must be strengthened. For only in multilateral forums  through constructive and meaningful dialog  can we establish a global consensus for peace  prosperity and development.All of us gathered here are aware that the United Nations is confronted today with a financial crisis of a proportion hitherto unseen. To my mind  the crisis that the United Nations faces today is symptomatic of a deeper malaise emanating from an erosion of faith in the concept of multilaterism. As regards the disagreement among some Member States with regard to the budgetary.process  I believe this can be resolved with a modicum of political will and commitment. The Secretary-General has already taken some helpful initiatives to meet the immediate liquidity problem. As to the medium and long-term aspects of the problem  the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts have made a number of substantive proposals. These proposals deserve our serious consideration  in the light of the principles and objectives of the Charter. We all look upon you  Mr. President  to guide us in resolving this crisis.The concept of the global village is no more a cliche. Rather it is a realityin this increasingly interdependent world. Peace and co-operation among nations are no longer mere aspirations; these are dire necessities fundamental to our future. What we seek is an atmosphere of global amity and understanding which can ensure equality and freedom  peace and prosperity for us all. It is  therefore  imperative that the spirit of multilateral co-operation be regenerated. The united Nations provides us with a forum and framework to do so. Let us now display our capacity to work together without subordinating ourselves to the dictates of our national interests and compulsions. Long live the United Nations!"
"13",667,"BGR",41,1986," Allow me first  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the high post of President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that under your able guidance the session will adopt important decisions aimed at strengthening peace and security for the well-being of all countries and peoples.We live in a complex  contradictory  and at the same time  interdependent world  it is faced with many difficult problems  but the most important is indisputably the survival of the human race and the prevention of a suicidal nuclear war. The world situation remains alarming. The arms race is tunning at an accelerated pace. Vast reservoirs of distrust and prejudice have been stored up in relations among States. An anachronistic approach  based on reliance upon military force as the main instrument for solving world problems  is still having a ruinous effect on the international climate.Today  mankind is going through a critical moment of its history. Never before has it been so acutely confronted by the dilemma of choosing to embark upon the salutary road of eliminating nuclear weapons  of disarmament and resolving pressing world problems  or to become a hostage and possible victim of the nuclear elements which it has itself unleashed.As was recently stated by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and President of the Council of State of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  Todor Zhivkovt""Nuclear catastrophe is a universal threat. Its prevention calls for the collective efforts of all Governments  States  parliaments  peoples  political parties  mass movements of peace activists  anti-missile movements  scientists and all people on earth  irrespective of class  national  ideological or religious differences.""There is only one way in which mankind can confidently enter the twenty-first century and that is through a policy of peaceful coexistence  co-operation and dialog among all States. That is the road leading to the future.In the modern nuclear and space age  one can no longer rely on force and on the maxim ""might is right"" to resolve the different problems in the international arena  nor to ensure the security of anyone. The desire to acquire military superiority  coupled with expansionist ambitions  accompanied by violations of the elementary rules of civilized relations  are in total contradiction with present-day realities. The existence of previously unheard-of means of destruction  capable of destroying every living thing  has put the problems of peace and war  strategy and politics in a different perspective.These realities require new political thinking and a decisive break from many stereotypes which have determined  and which still determine the positions of certain political circles on these issues. Objective analysis shows that in our time the security of any State cannot be ensured by military-technical means alone. The problem of security has taken on a universal character and a comprehensive political meaning  uniting the various military  economic and humanitarian aspects into a single whole. Peace is indivisible. This truth is valid now as never before. There can be no security for some which would endanger others. In other words  the safeguarding of national security requires that a reliable system of comprehensive international security be established. This position of principle underlies the proposal of the socialist countries  including the People's Republic of Bulgaria  to have the forty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations consider the question of establishing a comprehensive system of international peace and security.In putting forth this proposal  we do not proceed from abstract and Utopian ideas  but from a clear understanding of the imperatives at this juncture of politics and history. In order to guarantee international peace and security  urgent and purposeful actions are needed to curb the arms race  to reduce the military arsenals and to achieve real disarmament. It is imperative to eliminate the existing hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world and not to allow new ones to flare up. It is also necessary to restructure the whole system of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis  to overoome the backwardness of developing countries and to halt their economic exploitation. A comprehensive system of international security includes  as an integral part  active co-operation in humanitarian matters in order to ensure full enjoyment of human rights  above all the right to life and the right to peace  with respect for the sovereignty of States. The adoption by the world Organization of an authoritative document containing the fundamental principles of such a system which would serve as a guidepost in securing the requisite material  political  legal  moral  psychological and other guarantees of security  is the order of the day.As has already been said  disarmament is the corner-stone of such a system. For every sober-minded person it is perfectly clear that the lessening of the danger of war depends precisely on the state of affairs in that area. Demonstrating high political responsibility  the socialist countries have during the last year alone put forward a whole set of well-founded ideas for reducing military confrontation. In this connection  we should particularly point out the scope  viability and boldness of the program for the total elimination of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000 as set forth by Mikhail S. Gorbachev on 15 January 1986.The Soviet Union has submitted a number of concrete and constructive proposals to help reach agreements in the talks on strategic arms and on medium-range missiles. I would also like to note the importance of the initiative on establishing ""star peace"" in contrast to ""star wars"" and on turning outer space into an arena of peaceful and fruitful co-operation among States. The socialist countries have elaborated and proposed a comprehensive plan for the reduction of conventional weapons from the Atlantic to the Urals.Today the question of ending nuclear-weapon tests has indeed become the sole criterion determining the position States take on the most urgent issue - averting the threat of a nuclear conflagration. More than a year has passed since the Soviet Union  rejecting the traditional canons of confrontation  took a wise and farsighted step by adopting a unilateral moratorium on nuclear tesing. The latest extension of the moratorium to 1 January 1987 is a vivid demonstration of the sincerity and seriousness of soviet policy. This decision represents both a genuine step towards disarmament and a major and effective confidence-building measure. It provides a historic opportunity to rethink outdated concepts and to proceed in a practical fashion to the elimination of nuclear arsenals which is so much talked about and demanded by all peoples of the world. Now  obviously  the problem of verification should no longer pose any obstacles to this aim.The peace proposals of the socialist countries contribute to improving the international climate and to achieving a breakthrough for the purpose of banning war from the life of present and succeeding generations. They are in accord with the interests of all mankind  with the aspirations of peoples throughout the world and with the officially expressed positions of dozens of countries in support of a world free of armaments and wars.The international situation remains complicated and tense. Our assessment  however  would be inaccurate if we were to see only dark colors. The awareness of the common interests of the vast majority of States on the planet is emerging ever more clearly as the dominant factor in the dynamic interaction of tendencies in the world arena. On this basis  a broad international consensus is taking shape on the vitally important problems of peace and war  security and disarmament. Peoples have begun to talk with each other on these problems in one and the same language without the need of an interpreter.A major contribution to the struggle to maintain peace is also being made by the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement. In Harare  at its recently concluded conference  the Movement called for common sense and political realism and for the urgent taking of concrete measures to improve the present situation.We endorse the proposal that the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement should participate in one form or another in the work of the Security Council. We also highly value the efforts made by the Heads of State of the Six aimed at the immediate cessation of the arms race in its most dangerous and ruinous forms. The success of the Stockholm Conference is an example of the triumph of realism and of a sense of responsibility. The reaffirmation of the obligation of States not to use force against one another and the adoption of a wide spectrum of mutually complementary confidence-building and security measures has undoubtedly strengthened the foundations laid at Helsinki on which the common edifice of detente is built. We would like to expect such results from the forthcoming Meeting in Vienna as well. Also on the agenda is the reaching of agreement on banning chemical weapons.Peoples have also placed great hopes in the Soviet-American dialog. The international community was very pleased to learn of the forthcoming meeting in Reykjavik. This is only natural and understandable. We are talking about those States that are most powerful in military and economic matters  and it is on there  first and foremost  that the curbing of the arms race and the prevention of a third world war depend. Together with other peace-loving countries  we also expect much from the Soviet-American contacts at the summit level. They could reach key agreements having a long-term positive impact in all areas of world politics. Good will and a sober view  freed from the dogmas of militarist thinking  would be sufficient for this to come about. On the whole  the current state of international affairs provides most serious grounds for concern as well as for optimism. The world has begun to think in simple and normal human terms about breaking out of the nuclear deadlock.The priority which ny country attaches to disarmament in no way diminishes forus the importance of resolving the conflicts in various regions of the world. Weproceed from the understanding that today issues of international security areinseparable from the peaceful and just settlement of various conflicts whichinflict death and suffering on many peoples and which could easily escalate into a global confrontation.In this connection  we welcome the proposal for convening an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. As a first step in that direction  Bulgaria supports  in particular  the idea of setting up a preparatory committee within the framework of the Security Council. The establishment of a just and lasting peace categorically requires the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories occupied since 1967  the exercise by the Arab people of Palestine of its inalienable and legitimate rights  including the right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State-  it requires also the ensuring of the right of all States of the region to exist in conditions of peace and security.The problem of Cyprus also remains unresolved. In the interests of the people of Cyprus and of international security that hotbed of tension in the Mediterranean must as a matter of urgency be eliminated. We support the idea of convening an international conference to try to reach a viable and enduring settlement of the question of Cyprus  one that would ensure the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus as a non-aligned State on whose territory there would be no foreign troops and no military bases.The situation in Central America and the Caribbean basin is also a source of great concern to us. A powerful imperialist State brutally threatens Cuba  persists in its aggressive action against the democratic gains of the Nicaraguan people and flouts the decisions of the International Court of Justice. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is in full solidarity with Nicaragua in its heroic struggle to safeguard its freedom and sovereignty  and welcomes its readiness to sign a regional peace treaty. We support the efforts of the Contadora Group and of the Lima Group fpr a political settlement of the situation without outside interference.It is high time the international community took immediate and effective measures to put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia and to grant independence to its people  in compliance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  as was also demanded by the General Assembly at its recently concluded special session on this question. Together with the overwhelming majority of Member States  we categorically condemn the criminal system of apartheid in South Africa and South Africa's acts of aggression against neighboring countries  as well as the support rendered it by its well-known protectors. Comprehensive mandatory sanctions must be imposed on Pretoria as soon as possible  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  and an end must be put to that shameful phenomenon The People's Republic of Bulgaria also calls for an end to the destructive war between Iran and Iraq and for a peaceful settlement of the issues in dispute.My country supports the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the southern part of the peninsula and for its transformation into a nuclear-weapon-free zone for the peaceful and democratic unification of the country.Conditions also exist for a political solution to the problems relating to Afghanistan and Kampuchea. Such a solution depends entirely on those who have created the tensions around those two countries and are continuing to aggravate them.Regional initiatives and the elaboration of confidence-building measures among States to secure the inviolability of their borders have a considerable potential for strengthening international security. As already mentioned  extensive positive experience in this respect has already been gained in Europe. The necessary conditions exist for the initiation of a similar process in other parts of the world also. In this connection we see merit in the proposal to include the region of Asia and the Pacific in the efforts to establish a comprehensive system of international security  the implementation of which would decisively facilitate the overall normalization of the world situation.There is need for close co-operation among States in many other areas as well  i would mention one  namely  the fight against terrorism. The black hand of terrorism reaches out into the lives of innocent people and breeds an atmosphere of fear  mistrust and tension. The People's Republic of Bulgaria resolutely condemns and repudiates the hijacking of aircraft  the taking of hostages  assassinations  and accordingly the mass and arbitrary acts of repression that are sought to be justified in their name  all bearing the mark of obscurantism and inhumanity. In many cases  acts of terrorism are the result of such no less outrageous phenomena as occupation  annexation  foreign domination and other forms of violence. Terrorism could be wiped out completely through a resolute struggle against its manifestations and through elimination of its socio-political causes. One of the important problems under consideration by this world Organization is the role of the mass information media in the present-day world. That powerful instrument of civilization must be placed in the service of peace  co-operation and progress.The various and complex problems facing mankind require collective  concerted action on the part of all States  large and small alike. The United Nations  as the most authoritative and in essence universal international Organization  is the sole forum where all world problems are being addressed in the search for common approaches to their solution.The overwhelming majority of Member States sincerely support the United Nations and seek to enhance its effectiveness. The People's Republic of Bulgaria fully shares that position. We are  however  concerned at the attempts of certain Member States to impose on the Organization methods of work and aims that are incompatible with its Charter and to create difficulties that would impede the normal and undisturbed activities of Member States. Today we are all responsible for keeping alive and consolidating trust in the United Nations  which like a living organism develops and breathes in a changing political climate. The great demands of the present time require that the United Nations find a proper course of action in the complicated situation that now exists and affirm itself as a mainstay of peace and security. We would like to avail ourselves of this opportunity to express our profound respect to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and to reaffirm our support for his tireless efforts in this area.As a Balkan State  the People's Republic of Bulgaria devotes particular attention to its relations with the other countries in that part of the world. We are pleased to note that  on the whole  our relations are developing well and in a stable way and are steadily improving. At the same time we must note that attempts have recently been made to undermine confidence and engender tensions in our peninsula. As far as we are concerned  we are opposed to such tendencies and have consistently been exerting efforts to further co-operation in various fields where there are long-term common interests.Bulgaria is continuing its efforts to transform the Balkans into a zone free of nuclear and chemical weapons. We reaffirm our proposal for the conclusion  with all Balkan countries  of bilateral agreements which would include a code of good-neighborly relations. Quite recently my country signed an important bilateral document embodying the lofty principles and ideals set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and in the pan-European process. We have also put forth an initiative for the elaboration and adoption by the Balkan States of a treaty on protection of the environment of our peninsula and for the drafting of a joint appeal on that issue to all the countries and peoples of Europe. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is doing all in its power to implement the ideals of international peace and security. The Thirteenth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party  held earlier this year  charted the basic directions of our foreign policy. We are seeking political dialog  and mutually advantageous and equitable co-operation  with all those who desire it  and are fighting steadily for the elimination of vestiges of colonialism  fighting against neo-colonialism  racism and apartheid  fighting for respect for human rights  and above all the right to life in conditions of peace and freedom. We are active participants in the work of the world Organization and other international forums  and we contribute to the settlement of regional conflicts and help to resolve pressing global problems.That is how we see our role in building that just and harmonious world without wars which all nations wish to see."
"14",712,"BHR",41,1986,"Allow me at the outset. Sir  to offer you my sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-first session of the General AssAwhiv and to wish you all success in presiding over its deliberations. I take this opportunity also to congratulate Bangladesh  a friendly country to which we are linked by the closest historical  social and political ties.On behalf of my delegation  it gives me pleasure to thank your predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  for his valuable contribution to the work of the previous session. I also wish to express my deep appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his efforts to maintain co-operation and security in the world. We express our hope that he will continue in his noble task.The proclamation by the United Nations General Assembly designating 1986 the International Year of Peace is indeed an occasion for the peoples of the world to pause and reflect on how to save the world from the dangers of destruction and annihilation posed by the nuclear terror overshadowing our lives.The international community is today confronted by a crisis in which the arms race  and particularly nuclear rearmament  threatens the future and very existence of man and his very existence. One of the reasons for this crisis may be the inability of the international community to put behind it the accumulated bitterness and tragedy of modern history. The memory of wars  destruction and colonialism continues to sow in our breasts feelings of insecurity and of doubt about our ability to lay to rest the bitter experiences of the past. Fear and mutual distrust have led to an open-ended arms race  especially between the two super-Powers  whose combined military spending is approximately 70 per cent of total world expenditure. This is undoubtedly contrary to man's natural duty to develop the earth's resources and to preserve human civilization. Relations between nations are today characterized by excessive selfishness and acute conflict between various principles and ideologies on the one hand and political and economic self-interest on the other. Violence is often used as a means to satisfy such ambitions. It is no wonder that such a deterioration in international relations leads to failure and undermines man's confidence in a future of security  stability and peace.The international community is aware of the extent of the current crisis in international relations. It is also aware of the horrors of any nuclear war  however limited. That awareness and realization have not  however  prompted the international community to seek effective solutions to the political and ideological differences existing in the current social and economic order so that an international order may be established for the maintenance of peace and the promotion of security and stability in the world.The endemic crisis of confidence among major Powers is undoubtedly one of the main reasons for the failure of disarmament negotiations and of the attempt to establish an international order based on collective security.That tendency in international relations has led to a frenzied race to impose policies of polarization and cold war in many parts of the world. It has engendered security fears in the third world  which has been subjected by some Powers to unlimited hegemony and influence and the control of all its energy resources and raw materials. Those Powers have deprived the peoples of the third world of their right to sovereignty over their national resources and the right to obtain a fair price for their goods. They have also incited regional strife and worsened conditions in hotbeds of tension in many parts of the third world  which have become open markets for the arms dealers.*Such extremist  policies have created a new situation with two contradictory features: whereas the advanced countries devote most of their resources to the development of land and the building of civilization  they ate also using their potential and immense wealth for the manufacture of instruments of destruction and annihilation. Thus  construction and destruction have become the twin aspects of this conflict  which has diverted the course of international relations to such an extent that calls for international co-operation and collective security amount in most cases to little more than empty talk.If the international community is to confront the challenge of the nuclear horror  it must mobilize all its capacity for joint collective co-operation and find solutions to pressing human problems instead of indulging in conflict and rivalry in international relations  which can lead only to collective destruction and complete annihilation.Thus it can be said that the questions of security  peace and disarmament -particularly nuclear disarmament - concern not only the two super-Powers or the nuclear-weapon States  but closely affect the fate of all peoples. We hope that the accident that took place recently at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union  as well as similar incidents  will convince States possessing nuclear weapons and installations that collective action on joint security measures for all States and peoples are necessary and  indeed  inevitable.In this context we should like to underline the point made in the report of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues  chaired by Mr. Olof Palme  the late Prime Minister of Sweden  that international peace must rest on a commitment to joint survival rather than on the threat of mutual destruction. The international arena is crowded with international disputes and regional hotbeds of tension awaiting prompt solutions. Undoubtedly  most if notall of such regional disputes are due to international interactions and to a network of interests that are competing on the political  economic and strategic levels.It is indeed regrettable that the United Nations  which has accomplished so much in the humanitarian  economic and social fields  has not been able to satisfy the longings of the peoples of the world to be saved from the menace of war  or to ensure that present and future generations can live in security  comfort and peace.The principles of the Charter would be sufficient to guarantee prosperity  progress  security and equality to all peoples of the world  if only relations among States were based on the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Thus as the Secretary-General says in his annual report  we should not only believe in such principles  but also apply them in our international dealings and relations.In that connection  it is with great sadness and pain that we have been watching the bitter war between Iraq and Iran. That war has now entered its seventh year and has inflicted much grief and destruction on those two neighboring countries. In spite of all initiatives and serious attempts to settle that dispute by the united Nations  the Gulf Co-operation Council  the Islamic Conference  the Non-Aligned Movement and individual and regional mediation efforts  Iran unfortunately has not yet responded to calls for peace.We call for the cessation of hostilities  because we are concerned about the peace and security of those two neighboring countries and peoples and wish to save them from the further losses and total destruction which will be the inevitable result of an unending war. As a country that feels some responsibility as a neighbor living in the region ravaged by the war  we make a sincere and unbiased  appeal to Iran to respond to those calls for peace. Iran can look for solid support from the States of the Gulf region in restoring peace and security in the area.FrocB this rostrum  we once again call upon the United Nations to continue its efforts to create the right conditions for a dialog that will end this destructive war. At the same tine we call upon the influential Powers in the world community to shoulder their responsibilities and make a real effort to arrive at a definitive solution to the Iraq-Iran dispute that will safeguard the legitimate rights of both parties.Some believe that the Iraq-Iran war is of limited scope and thus does not warrant greater attention at the cost of other international questions  particularly since oil is flowing normally and Meeting the needs of world Markets. Some world Powers which hold this narrow view of the Iraq-Iran war and of security in the Gulf region concentrate their attention on oil  open Markets and the arms trade  ignoring the political lessons and historical trends in the region.The unalterable facts of history show that the many civilizations that had existed in the Gulf region and the Arabian peninsula since time immemorial  were in a region separating the great civilizations of the East and the West. That central position led to economic prosperity  established Markets and active trade. This left its clear impact on political and social trends  which were in fact distinguished by political moderation and by co-operation with all other States in all fields of mutual interest.Those two distinctive features of the region were not always found together; they varied according to the changing historical situation. When the currents of extremism upset stability and coexistence in the region  the voice of moderation subsided and died  leading to political and economic effects and interaction and to the emergence of the interests of foreign Powers; this was harmful to some.That political fact proves that stability  peace and security in the region were always the main source of well-being and happiness for all who spoke in the solemn voice of moderation. He hope that this lesson of wisdom will resound in the ears and thoughts of those who are wagering on the continuation of the Iraq-Iran war and of those who are waiting^ in the hope of deriving personal gain from it. In this connection  we welcome the peace initiative put forward by Iraq on 2 August 1986 for the termination of the war  sc shat the people of the region might lead a normal life in security and stability.The question of Palestine and the problem of the Middle East provide the clearest example of the failure of international co-operation  whether within the United Nations or outside it. A number of States have made individual contacts with the parties to the dispute and have put forward various initiatives for the peaceful settlement of the dispute in that region. Earlier ineffectual attempts of this kind culminated in the conclusion of a treaty between Egypt and Israel. But the aggressive policies of Israel have not ceased. Israel attacked Iraq's peaceful nuclear installations in 1981  invaded Lebanon in 1982  and massacred Palestinian refugees in Sabra and Shatila - a massacre whose painful memory haunts us again this month. Israel has also pursued a policy of forcible occupation of Arab lands and has established settlement on occupied lands. It has annexed the Syrian Golan Heights and has altered the historical landmarks of Holy Jerusalem. It has raided the Tunis offices of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and has pursued a daily policy of suppression  dispersion and terrorism in the occupied Arab lands. It regularly launches savage attacks on Lebanon and Palestinian refugee camps  the latest of which were last week's air raids against southern Lebanon.Why have all these attempts and peace initiatives failed to bring peace to the Middle East?He believe that most of these efforts and initiatives were based on unrealistic assumptions. They ignored the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the entire question of Palestine  which is at the core of the dispute in the Middle East. In short  efforts to settle the Arab-Israeli dispute were misdirected. All initiatives and efforts - whatever their source and irrespective of the good intentions of their sponsor - will inevitably fail if they are not based on a just and comprehensive solution of the question of Palestine and of the Palestinian people.Although that fact is obvious  sane States still lean towards the Israeli view of this cause  which is vital to the Arab nation. That view can provide nothing more than partial solutions guaranteeing neither stability nor peace and giving no momentum to the cause of genuine peace in the region. A comprehensive and lasting peace should be based on just principles  the main element of which is recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent State on their national soil  under the leadership of the PLO  their sole legitimate representative. The PLO should be a principal participant in any peaceful effort towards the practical  fair solution of this question. The convening of an international conference with the participation of all the interested parties and the permanent members of the Security Council would be a practical step towards the achievement of a just and lasting peace in the region.The awakening of the indigenous majority in South Africa has attracted the attention of world public opinion. It has become crystal clear to the international community that the black majority  which has been struggling for many years against injustice and oppression  has risen in a massive revolt aimed at dismantling the racist regime.Bitter experience has now shown the black population that proposed reforms offered now and again by the racist regime are merely political sops intended to contain local and world discontent. It has become clear to all that the problem in South Africa is not merely political; it is also a question of immoral practices which are loathed by all the world's peoples as being inconsistent with the principles of human equality and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Coexistence with such a regime is impossible; whatever other concessions may be made by the racist regime  the main principles of its detested system of apartheid will be retained. World attention should therefore be directed at formulating a clear plan of action that will compel the Pretoria regime to submit to the demands of justice and equality and dismantle its system of racial discrimination  which is a political and social regime incompatible with human dignity. The international community should take steps to reflect in practice its support for the legitimate struggle of the people of South Africa  for moral support has proven ineffective in compelling the Pretoria regime to abandon its system of racial discrimination.The non-aligned summit Conference  held at Harare from 1 to 7 September this year  adopted unambiguous decisions on this subject. We call upon the international community to support the decisions of that Conference. We believe that the time has come for the Security Council - and particularly its permanent members - to shoulder its international responsibility and impose a comprehensive boycott and strict economic sanctions against South Africa in order to compel that racist regime to yield to the dictates of justice and equality.The South African regime continues illegally to occupy the Territory of Namibia  in violation of General Assembly resolutions  in particular resolution 3314 (XXIX) of 14 December 1974. We regret that no progress has been made towards implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  outlined in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We reiterate our full support for the lawful struggle of the people of Namibia for freedom and independence  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  its genuine  legitimate representative.The Afghan people has languished under the yoke of foreign occupation since 1973  when it lost its freedom under an alien regime imposed by the force of arms. The people of Afghanistan have been compelled to live under an unacceptable system  which they have resisted by faith and by arms. We call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces in conformity with the will of the international community  as embodied in General Assembly resolutions. The Afghan people should be permitted to choose a political and social system compatible with its history and ancient heritage. We hope that the efforts of the Secretary-General will be successful  so that the Afghan people may regain its freedom and freely express its will  safe from policies of hegemony  polarization and threats.As regards the question of Cyprus  we welcome the Secretary-General's attempts to narrow the differences between the two parties to the dispute  thus paving the way towards a just and lasting peaceful settlement.With regard to tho question of Korea  we sympathize with the wish of the Korean people in both parts of Korea for reunification  and we welcome all constructive dialog to that effect.The world economy is in acute crisis  which threatens the present and future of all the world's peoples. It might therefore be that economic matters should be placed high on the list of international priorities so that they may become a principal theme of contemporary international co-operation. It is strange indeed that this acute crisis in the world economy has not awakened the international community to its crushing burden  as international economic oo-operation recedes in spit* of the interdependence of the world economy and its increased universality. In other words  the universality and interdependence of economic affairs have not been accompanied by international co-operation to face up to the challenges of the current economic crisis. It is clear today that world economic relations have passed from the stage of problem to that of crisis. This threatens the existence of man  in exactly the same way as nuclear terror and strategic arms. This crisis makes it imperative to correct the course of current international relations  so that a new international economic order may be established.This crisis has had a strong impact on the economies of the third world in the past three years. Rates of economic growth began to fall drastically  and the terms of trade deteriorated sharply; there was also a reduction in the prices of primary materials  commodities and oil. That  in turn  inflated the volume of external debts and the cost of servicing them. Confusion in the fields of currency  finance and exchange rates increased. The advanced  industrialized countries started to adopt protectionist economic policies and to impose strict barriers against the exports of the developing countries. That further undermined the economies of the third world.These economic conditions have upset the economies of developing countries  because of the ominous consequences they will have unless the international community corrects the deviations in the course of economic relations by introducing drastic reforms in the current economic structure. The time has come for the advanced  industrialized countries to realize not only that the continued deterioration o£ economic conditions will undermine the political and social systems of the third world  but also that the advanced countries will not be immune from their adverse effects and negative developments. We hope that these facts will prompt the advanced and industrialized countries to open a new chapter of concrete economic negotiations with the developing nations  and to go beyond formal differences and concentrate on issues of substance.Peace is a human quest. Nations and States have longed for and aspired to peace from ancient times  so that they might enjoy stability and security  particularly in areas shattered by conflict and war. The United Nations was established after the Second World War to save succeeding generations from the scourge of a new war.Now that the twentieth century is almost at an end  peace has become  with all its political and social implications  a necessity - indeed  a pressing world necessity  which will shape the fate of man and his present and future existence. We therefore look forward to the future with hope and expectation. We want to dispel pessimism and give future generations confidence in the viability of collective action for the good of humanity  so that mature human dialog may bring happiness to man and save him from the threats of fear and instability and the unpredictability of the future.I am pleased to state from this rostrum that the State of Bahrain  which believes in the noble goals of the United Nations Charter  is prepared to work hard and co-operate sincerely and constructively with all other States for the maintenance of peace and security in the world and the achievement of those noble goals of the Charter of our Organization."
"15",750,"BHS",41,1986,"On behalf of the Government and people of a fellow Commonwealth nation  I have the honor to congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. The fact that our Governments are closely linked through several agreements makes it all the more pleasurable for me to express ray delegation's willingness to assist you in your onerous task.I wish to pay a tribute  Mr. President  to your predecessor  Don Jaime de Pinies  who performed admirably under very difficult circumstances. It is no exaggeration to say that from one of the most experienced  skillful and affable diplomats the General Assembly expected  and received nothing less than  expert leadership. Last year  during the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  an earnest reassessment of the Organization was made. Its notable achievements were highlighted and many of its shortcomings were emphasized. It cannot be disputed that the Organization has played a significant role in promoting interdependence and has been a stabilizing influence in a turbulent world.** Yet a higher level of international co-operation is vital if we are to settle our problems. Hence  all countries have a stake in strengthening the Organization's capability to meet the needs of mankind.The achievement of peace is in the best interest of all States. It is timely  therefore  that the United Nations has proclaimed 1986  the year after its fortieth anniversary  the International Year of Peace. The dedication of this year to peace underlines the foremost purpose enshrined in the United Nations Charter: to maintain international peace and security. It is only in a peaceful environment  whether local  regional or global  that we can hope to implement the significant and lasting improvements in the quality of life that are so desperately needed around the world.Regrettably  the growing trend towards unilateral action tends to undermine the Organization's central role in dealing with pressing global problems. Further  progress is urgently needed in coping with the financial crisis of the United Nations  arresting the erosion of multilateral: -as  particularly in the area of international trade and debt  halting escalation of the arms race  combating terrorism  reducing international tensions  interdicting the trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  and ending the racist policies of the Government of South Africa.We are all acutely aware of the financial problems which threaten to cause the United Nations to disintegrate. Earlier this year the crisis not only intensified but threatened the ability of the Organization to protect the principles for which it was founded. A disastrous end was averted owing to creative and determined responses promoted by the dedication and determination of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His forthright decisions and tireless efforts have been instrumental in persuading Member States to keep the Organization intact and its high principles alive. It is evident that there is much more to be done  but I sense that the uncertainty which surrounded the survival of the United Nations has abated to some degree. We  as Member States  oust co-operate more than ever before in carrying out the necessary recommendations to ensure the continued existence and effectiveness of the United Nations.One of the Organization's most pressing responsibilities concerns the issue of disarmament. In 1978  at the first special session devoted to disarmament  the General Assembly unanimously reaffirmed the goal of the United Nations totally to eliminate atomic weapons and to ensure that atomic energy would be used solely for peaceful purposes. In the ensuing years various measures have been proposed to achieve this goal  including the destruction of and cessation of the prediction of nuclear weapons  a cut-off in the production of weapon-grade fissionable material and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones.In essence  even the super-Powers and other militarily significant States agree with the view that any further escalation of the arms race would pose untold dangers for the survival of mankind. However  there seems to be an attitude of indifference and inflexibility until an actual disaster occurs. Certainly history supports the maxim that prevention is better than cure.The Bahamas is heartened by the very strong universal public opposition to the escalation of the arms race. We note the growing number of non-governmental organizations and church and civic groups  which are extremely active in this regard and should be given as much encouragement as possible.International peace and security have been endangered by acts of terrorism and hostage-taking. An alarming number of human lives have already been lost. The Bahamas emphasizes that our times call for multilateral co-operation to find solutions to the underlying problems that give rise to terrorism. Efforts must also be made to apply and strengthen the various mechanisms and instruments available to the international community as safeguards against this ongoing menace.The Bahamas is also a party to the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages and has recently introduced legislation implementing the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons  including Diplomatic Agents. We also firmly support the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  and other relevant instruments.When we look around we observe conflicts in several regions of the world which have increased the level of international tension. The Iran-Iraq war is still ominous despite the many efforts of the Secretary-General  the Security Council and other mediators to persuade the opponents to end a costly and destructive war. Multilateral efforts to end the war must be intensified if the danger it poses to the security of the region is to be averted.The Middle East continues to be a hotbed of tension and  besides the mounting death toll and devastation of property and of the environment  thousands of people are homeless and nomadic. The obstacles to peace and stability must be realistically confronted.The conflict in Western Sahara continues to escalate despite the appeals and efforts of the international community. Also  turning to South West Africa  there is no clear sign that Namibia will become a sovereign nation in the near future.The question of Cyprus remains unsettled  despite the occasions when a solution seemed imminent.In Afghanistan  the international community must strive relentlessly to end aconflict which has taken a grim toll of lives and which continues to exacerbate theworld refugee situation and to destroy families. We should not be deterred by theabsence of visible signs of movement by opposing sides to resolve this smoldering conflict. In our region of Latin America and the Caribbean we have pockets of conflict Mid confrontation which require a greater measure of peace and stability. The Bahamas commands the efforts of the Contadora Group as a realistic approach to quelling the conflict in Central America. We would appeal to all parties involvedto give the process a reasonable chance.The Bahamas is pleased to note that the issue of the security of snail States is being addressed increasingly and more meaningfully in such international forums as the General Assembly  the Commonwealth  the oOrganization of American States the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Rations Conference on Trade and Development.At the regional level  the ministers for foreign affairs of the Caribbean Community   at their annual meeting in Belize last June  repeated their call to the international community to respect the right of every State  regardless of size  to a peaceful  secure and sovereign existence and urged the multilateral financial institutions to respond to the special needs of small  developing countries.It is widely accepted that small States are particularly vulnerable. They are dependent on multilateralism to promote a stable environment in which development can take place and to erect barriers against the arbitrary use and abuse of military  economic or political power. Too often  instability results from external influences of an economic or military nature and from the deployment of mercenaries against national Governments.The participants in a Commonwealth colloquium on the special needs of small States held in Nassau last year recognized the need for the international community to continue to consider the constraints placed on small States and to consider special measures to assist island developing countries to maintain and improve their economic  political and social security. Small States do not deserve less simply because of their size and they  too  have a significant part to play in the process of strengthening international peace and collective security.Drug trafficking and drug abuse are aggravating an already unsettled world climate. The destructive effects of that international phenomenon are undermining the security  stability and socio-economic viability of a growing number of States. The intense multilateral response to drug trafficking and drug abuse offers good prospects for stemming the expansion of this menace. The Bahamas is endeavoring to participate actively in bringing to fruition notable international initiatives  including the new convention against the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  the meeting of the heads of narcotic law enforcement agencies held in Vienna earlier this year and the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking that is to be held in Vienna in 1987. The success of these and other initiatives is vital to the strengthening ofa comprehensive regime for drug control.Accommodation  balance and general agreement  particularly among the producercountries  the consumer countries and these countries in the chain of illicit traffic  are being encouraged in all endeavors. In that way  new and creative responses  including the forfeiture of the proceeds of drug crimes  measures to alleviate the special problems of transit States and the comprehensive multidisciplinary framework for drug control to be adopted at the Conference on drug abuse next year  can provide an impetus to international efforts.At the regional level  the Bahamas is pleased to be associated with the decisive step taken by the Americas in the establishment of the Inter-American Commission on Narcotic Drugs. In our own subregion  the Caribbean Community is resolute in its support for the promotion and development of a coherent strategy for drug control. This is concomitant with our critical concern to counteract the organized and sophisticated international drug trafficking organizations which continue to exploit the vulnerability and strategic location of the area for the trans-shipment of narcotic drugs to North America and Europe. Those initiatives are in keeping with the goals and objectives of the community.Bilaterally  the Bahamas - a transit State which produces no narcotic drugs -is co-operating very closely and successfully with the United States of America in joint air  land and sea operations in the war against drug traffickers who would use Bahamian territory to transfer their cargoes to the United States of America. In the Bahamas  our national policy is to eradicate drug trafficking and drug abuse.In response to the nefarious practice of drug trafficking  ray Government will soon present to Parliament a bill on drug-trafficking offenses. The bill provides new powers for tracing and freezing the proceeds of drug trafficking and for the imposition of a confiscation order on persons convicted of a drug offense. It also provides for increased maximum periods of imprisonment in default  in situations where the amount of the confiscation order is not paid in full  and it defines new offenses consisting of assisting another person to retain the proceeds of drug trafficking and of disclosing information likely to prejudice a drug-trafficking investigation.Bahamian organizations and the general public have become sensitized to the seriousness of the problem of drug abuse and are giving positive assistance to the national effort. The Bahamas believes in the ability of the international community to find lasting solutions to the problems of drug trafficking and drug abuse  and we are committed to international drug control efforts  particularly the work of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the forthcoming world Conference. It is therefore our earnest hope that the international community will support our candidature for those bodies.The recovery and expansion in the industrial and developed countries and economies have not for the most part been mirrored in the developing countries. Many developing countries are obliged to adopt a policy of structural adjustment necessitating reductions in imports and in domestic investment. The prospects for recovery are further dimmed by the heavy debt burden.Economic interdependence is a reality. Where possible  it is in the interests of all States to facilitate the flew of resources from private and public sources to the developing countries and to grant free access to the trade of those countries. Protectionist measures adopted by the developed countries that are detrimental to the economic recovery of the developing countries should be reviewed and repealed.In this regard  the Bahamas was heartened by the United Nations response to a critical situation. By its convening of a special session of the General Assembly on the serious economic situation in Africa earlier this year  the Organization underlined the efficacy of the multilateral approach to issues of developmental assistance and support. That historic session demonstrated that the United Nations is ready to consider the economic problems of any region of the world comprehensively and effectively. The five-year program of action for Africa's economic recovery and development has the full support of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.The Bahamas concurs with the view of the Secretary-General that tapping the resources of Africa  a continent rich in physical and human resources  would go a long way towards meeting the aspirations of its people and at the same time contributing to the economic and social well-being of the region and of the whole worId.The Bahamas is impressed by the determination and commitment of the African countries themselves to launch programs for their economic development and to take upon themselves the bulk of the burden of the estimated 3128 billion required to implement the five-year program of action.The racist policy of apartheid of the Government of South Africa has as its foundation discrimination and denationalization and brutal repression of the blade majority. The rising tide of black resistance to apartheid is evidence that the black majority will no longer be patient. It is undaunted by the brutal and savage repression and by the frequent and lengthy states of emergency  and it has courageously defied the state of emergency imposed in June of this year  the tenth anniversary of the Soweto uprising. Racial desegregation  social justice and the abolition of apartheid are now considered by many as life-and-death issues.The racist South African regime is obstinately determined to maintain white supremacy at all costs. It has failed to heed the appeals of the international community  including the United Nations and the Commonwealth  to undertake fundamental changes in the system of apartheid. It has discredited the call for peaceful change by itself resorting to repression and brutality   It has refused to negotiate with credible black leaders within South Africa.At a meeting in London last August  seven Heads of Government of the Commonwealth determined that no concrete progress had been made in dismantling apartheid since the Nassau meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government. The seven leaders re-examined the situation as mandated in the Nassau Accord on southern Africa and were disappointed that Pretoria had taken none of the substantive suggestions put forward in the Nassau Accord. In fact  the report of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group concluded that the absence of effective economic pressure on South Africa and the belief that pressure need not be feared were delaying change.The Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group contended that the worst blood-bath since the Second World War might occur in South Africa if the Government there felt that it did not have to fear effective economic measures. The only way to deal with Pretoria is severely to increase economic sanctions.Regrettably  the South African Government is not interested in negotiations at this time  and has consciously moved away free any realistic negotiating process. Hence  the international community has no meaningful alternative to adopting economic sanctions against South Africa. Otherwise  the only logical projection is that South Africa is headed into an increasingly violent and bloody struggle  after which power-scaring will for all practical purposes be out of the question.The Bahamas concurs with the Secretary-General's admonition to the World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  held last June  that""it is high time for the South African Government to realize that time is running out for a negotiated settlement aid to understand that its defiance of the international community as a whole cannot be tolerated indefinitely."" Since South Africa does not intend to abandon its apartheid policy voluntarily  what is required is a range of economic sanctions sufficiently costly to compel South Africa to initiate the process of dialog with representatives of the African National Congress of South Africa and other legitimate organizations of the black population with a view to establishing a non-racial representative government. There is no need to add that the immediate release of Nelson Mandela would be essential to the process.Further  the sovereign States  neighbors of South Africa  ought to be protected from the incursions and boatings by the South African military  which murders innocent civilians and wreaks costly damage on their national health and strength. In this International Year of Peace  a United Nations presence in strategically related areas of Africa would go a long way towards saving the front-line States from the force and injustices imposed on them by South Africa's economic and military might.A just and non-racial society in South Africa would enhance the peace and stability of the whole southern African region  for the front-line States would no longer be the victims of a strategy of destabilization  direct military incursion and economic coercion. Accordingly  the Bahamas encourages the United Nations and all its Menber States  especially those with significant economic relations with South Africa  to implement effective economic sanctions with a view to abolishing apartheid.We believe too that resolute measures ought to be taken by all States that support self-determination  democracy and human rights to persuade South Africa to implement the plan for Namibian independence adopted in the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Economic considerations and appeasement of South Africa will further delay the independence of Namibia. In this International Year of Peace it is difficult for this august body to rationalize the continued subjugation of the people of Namibia. We are confident  however  that international commitment to the decolonization process will ensure that Namibia takes its seat in this Organization at an early date.To be effective  the the broad objectives of the Charter of this Organization require the fullest measure of support from as many sovereign nations as possible. The purposes set forth in the Charter are universal in scope  and to our minds can best be achieved by an organization with a universal membership. It would therefore seem to be advantageous  especially in this International Year of Peace  for all sovereign States that express their willingness to subscribe to the Charter to be allowed membership of this Organization  universality of membership would  I submit  not only increase the opportunities for dialog  but also make a positive contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security. It augurs well for the Organization that throughout the 1380s many resolutions relating to the social issues on its agenda have been adopted by consensus. In particular  the Bahamas has followed with interest matters related to youth  as per ens under the age of 30 constitute nearly three quarters of our population. The Bahamas was pleased to participate in the United Nations World Conference for the International Youth Year  held during the fortieth session of the General Assembly. The guide-lines for follow-up action to the International Youth Year are given due attention in the formulation of policies and programs of the Ministry of Youth  the National Youth Advisory Council and other relevant organizations.In closing  allow me to emphasize that the international community should not be thwarted by any conflict or tragedy which might mar the International Year of Peace. This body was organized at the close of the ""war to end all wars"". Its objective is to maintain international peace and security and to make military conflicts obsolete by entrenching the process of dialog and negotiation as the valid means of solving differences between nations  regardless of size  political influence and military or economic strength. The challenge  then  is to demonstrate through renewed determination and commitment that the goals of universal peace and security can be achieved.The international community nay be assured that the Bahamas remains committed to the fundamental principles enshrined in the Charter. The Bahamas stands firm in its conviction that the multilateral process must be maintained and strengthened if stability  order and justice are to prevail."
"16",822,"BLR",41,1986," Many different words have been spoken from this rostrum. However  those which have prevailed are those which have not been devalued through frequent repetition over a long period of time. Their everlasting value is due to the concepts they embody. ""Peace""  ""security""  ""freedom of peoples""  ""prosperity"" and ""a bright future for humanity"" - these are the words that fall into this category. They acquire special significance when backed up with specific proposals and practical deeds aimed at translating these ideals into the flesh and blood of today's international relations and at converting them into a foundation on which the generations to come will build their lives.At present mankind is going through a particularly crucial stage in its history. Now is the time to decide whether it will continue as a history of reason and peaceful creativity or become a history of global catastrophe. Throughout the preceding millennia humanity  even in times of ordeals and wars  kept looking forward with hope to the morrow  expecting it to be brighter  to bring about more joy and a better life. At present mankind is viewing its future with alarm. This profound feeling of alarm is caused by social injustice  destruction and pollution of the environment  diseases  hunger affecting whole nations and  above all  the threat of total nuclear annihilation. Mankind will be confident of its future only when it eliminates that threat through joint efforts.The removal of the nuclear and space threat and reversal of the arms race would enable humanity to keep its civilization humane in the best sense of the word and to release resources for economic and social progress. There can be no normal life on a nuclear powder-keg.The urgency of the situation and the sheer magnitude of the challenge require fundamentally new political thinking. The stereotyped dogmas of the past  such as ""might is right""  ""in politics weakness is an admission of guilt""  ""containment through deterrence"" and the like  are hopelessly out of date. Far from promoting the security of the peoples of the world  they place it in direct jeopardy. The Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization presented at this session also stressed the need for""a fresh beginning in efforts to overcome stalemates on major issues"". (A/41/1  p. 2).It is imperative to shed the dogma according to which the security of one State is built on impairing the security of another. In this nuclear and space age the only real security is security for all.The new political thinking must be translated into practical deeds. Guided by the need to ensure progress in nuclear disarmament as well as in other fields  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Gorbachev  has suggested an urgent meeting between the highest leaders of the Soviet Union and the United states of America. That proposal has been accepted by President Reagan. As the Assembly knows  the meeting will take place in Iceland on 11 and 12 October. It must give an overwhelmingly powerful impulse to negotiations and open up the shortest and most direct approach to the path leading to results. We regard impr • went in Soviet-United States relations not only in the context of the interests of the Soviet and American peoples but rather in terms of stronger security for all.It was through the desire to build a reliable road leading to exactly this kind of universal security that the States of the socialist community introduced their joint initiative on ""Establishment of a comprehensive system of international security"" for consideration at this session of the Assembly.The Byelorussian SSR  as a co-sponsor of the proposal  is convinced that relations between States must be built on the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for mutual interests - security interests in the first place - whichwould be ensured through material  political and legal  as well as moral and psychological  guarantees. They must be based on co-operation both in preserving life on Earth and in solving the entire gamut of global problems on which the quality of life depends.Experience teaches us that no State can reliably protect itself by military and technically means alone  even if it succeeds in gaining military superiority over the other side  something which is in fact unattainable. In view of the nature of modern weapons  security can be ensured only through political means. The old order of things must give way to a comprehensive system of international security embracing all spheres of inter-State relations - military  political  economic and humanitarian. Such a system not only would be in utmost harmony with the principles and purposes of the united Nations Charter but would also enhance their efficacy and the effectiveness of the Organization. It would be the only adequate response to the precarious situation in which humanity finds itself today. The United Nations  being universal both in its membership and in the range of issues it deals with  represents a unique international forum organically suitable for achieving that goal. The Byelorussian SSR  as a founding Member of the United Nations  is convinced that the Organization  which last year celebrated its fortieth anniversary  is mature enough and rich enough in experience for that purpose.We are realists and understand that a comprehensive system of international security will not be brought into existence overnight just by the wave of a magic wand. Persistent efforts will be required of all States. Which is needed is the political will and foresight  dialog and the ability and willingness to overcome myopic  short-lived and selfish calculations in order to agree on mutually acceptable compromises for the sake of the common good.To end the arms race on Earth and prevent it in outer space and to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction - that must be one of the principal basic elements of a comprehensive security system. The well-known German philosopher and humanist of the eighteenth century Johann Gottfried von Herder wrote at a time when arms were yet primitive  if judged by today's terms: ""The battle axe can create nothing  but it can cause a great deal of destruction."" The truth of those words has a thousand times greater thrust nowadays. The pernicious policy of the arms race has brought us to a point beyond which destruction may be total. Time itself is now running against humanity  because new means of annihilation are being devised which might not be subject to control at all. In these circumstances pronouncements to the effect that anything but an arms buildup can be the cause of mistrust between States are inappropriate. Without going into scholasticism  let us ask those who espouse this postulate: Do arms engender trust?Resolute practical moves are required to break out of the vicious spirals of the internal spring of the arms race. Real opportunities for that are opened up by the line of action pursued by the Soviet Union and all the States of the socialist community which reject the cliches of confrontation  defy the stereotypes in political thinking and artificial barriers. The USSR  through its practical actions  proves its readiness to seek compromise solutions to all problems that give rise to controversy or suspicion. The Soviet proposals of 15 January 1986 outlining a program for complete and general nuclear disarmament by the year 2000 are in line with the new requirements of today's world. Since those proposals are radical in their purpose - to rid the Earth completely not only of nuclear but also of chemical and other types of weapons of mass destruction - they provide for the necessity of appropriate verification measures and strict compliance at each stage of implementation with the principle of undiminished security for all States. They are based on the premise that the USSR and the United states of America should set an example for other nuclear-weapon Powers by talking real disarmament measures.A large-scale program of ""star peace"" providing for the development of diversified peaceful co-operation in outer space in the interests of all States and for the establishment of a world space organization has been submitted to the United Nations. This objective is in sharp contrast to the dangerous ""star wars"" plans  and it is clear to any sensible person which of the existing alternatives best serves the interests of the inhabitants of the planet.Indeed  if the objective of the total elimination of nuclear weapons is pursued in earnest and not for the sake of mere rhetoric  why choose to that end the much too dangerous and much too costly path for our planet of extending the arms race to outer space? Why abandon compliance with the treaties curbing the nuclear-arms race and undermine agreements strengthening stability? I am referring here to the strategic arms limitation treaties and the anti-ballistic missile treaty concluded between the USSR and the United States of America. Something must be wrong here  either with logic or true intentions  for there exists a simple and straightforward way - that of a mutual stage-by-stage elimination of nuclear weapons even before the end of this century. In the absence of nuclear weapons there will be no need for defense against such weapons.It should be emphasized that the Soviet union does not confine itself only to submitting proposals. Its constructive spirit and sincerity go far enough to introduce a new major element in international practice. The USSR has unilaterally taken large-scale measures of restraint and arms limitation: they include the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons; the halting of measures undertaken in response to the deployment of United States nuclear missiles in Europe; the subsequent removal from alert status of a large number of medium-range missiles in Europe; the obligation not to place anti-satellite systems in outer space; and  above all  the unilateral moratorium valid since 6 August 1985 on all nuclear explosions.The moratorium has been extended on four consecutive occasions  although it was obviously a difficult and security-threatening decision for the USSR to take  in view of the unabated and provocative continuation of testing of nuclear weapons in the United States. By virtue of the latest extension of the moratorium  the Soviet Union will observe the International Year of Peace with no nuclear testing. This is a practical example of a truly responsible approach to the problems of today's world - an example which gives mankind greater hope to relieve itself of the nuclear threat.A mutual halt to and prohibition of nuclear testing by the USSR and the United States of America are important in themselves and  moreover  will constitute a real step towards nuclear disarmament. What is needed are not half-measure resubstitute but a radical solution to the problem. The Byelorussian SSR expresses the hope that the United States will heed world public opinion and come to realize the need for halting nuclear-weapon tests.The objective of the gradual elimination of nuclear weapons includes also a geographical component and issues related to the levels of conventionalarmaments. Therefore  and in order to help to free Europe cf nuclear weapons  it has been proposed that nuclear medium-range missiles be eliminated from that continent and nuclear-weapon-free zones established there. Besides  the Warsaw Treaty member states have also proposed to the States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and all European countries a program for reducing in the near future by one fourth the armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe from the Atlantic to the Orals.New proposals have also been introduced allowing for final iz a tiers without any further delay of a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons  the elimination of their stockpiles  and the industrial base for their production.That is but a brief  overall list of the major proposals put forward by socialist countries. They are prepared to consider in earnest other countries' initiatives as well. This is our policy and it is based on the decisions of the Twenty-seventh Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Onion and has its roots in today's realities. It has been dictated by our responsibility vis-k-vis the future and takes into account the legitimate concerns of all parties.If no progress has been made so far in eliminating the nuclear space threat and reversing the arms race  that is only because progress can be achieved solely through contained efforts and shared awareness of our common responsibility. It is to be hoped that those to whom the States of the socialist community and the non-aligned countries have addressed their proposals will display genuine preparedness to engage in a two-way Movement along the highway of disarmament.There are those that claim that their arms build-up is for the sake of negotiations. From there  it is but a small step to conducting negotiations solely for the sake of the arras build-up. Indeed  toe military potential intended to serve as a bargaining chip is steadily being increased. Unfortunately  it is not being accompanied by progress at the negotiating table. Why is that? The United States does not want to accept the fact that acting from a position of force is no way to read) honest agreements. The logical aim of such a policy is to force one's bargaining partner to his knees and impose inequitable solutions. That is impossible in today's world. The aid result is increased nuclear tension. Does that best serve the vital interests of all nations  including the United States? Does it impart greater security to the world? The answer is self-evident; it is in the negative.It is to be hoped that the pragmatism and sense of reality that are inherent traits of the Americans will not fall victim to the syndrome of thinking in military terms  and that realism and awareness of the need for a joint search for ways to normalize the international situation  put an end to the senseless arms race and eliminate nuclear weapons will prevail in United States assessments and actions. The agreement between the USSR and the United States on the summit meeting soon to be held in Reykjavik inspires optimism. It is important that that meeting pave the way to the achievement of meaningful agreements at future talks and meetings.History has shown that militarist policies and the desire to attain world domination are increasingly isolated  both morally and politically  in the international arena. Vigorous attempts to implant militaristic stereotypes in people's minds have not had the expected result. The debate in the General Assembly leaves no doubt in this regard. At the same time  it can be said with utter certainty that no one is trying to drive the United states into a corner. Or the contrary  there is a common desire to involve the United States of America in sincere efforts to achieve a breakthrough in international relations  to awaken the Chi ted States to the need to fulfill its responsibility for the fate of peace on earth. Everyone is aware of the fact that without the constructive participation of the united States of America and other countries there can be no lasting solution to the problem of eliminating the threat of war and the per sis tent regional conflicts and to other global problems. Such an approach is manifest in the initiatives of socialist countries which envisage collective efforts  and in the Harare documents of the Non-Aligned Movement.What  then  stands in the way? To a great extent  the impediment is anti-Soviet feeling and false perceptions of Marxist-Leninist ideology.Some people in the Nest have yet to realize that all peoples  communists including  have no less a right to life  their beliefs and their way of life than have anti-communists. Are these in Western ruling circles prepared to recognize those rights to socialism and to work together with it for peace? Can they overcome the inertia of the anti-communist mentality and adopt the position of the peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems?We have heard from this rostrum  allegations that Marxism-Leninism and war are inseparable. Let us recall a few of the facts  which are obviously well known to everyone  including those that make such statements. The first decree of the Soviet State was the Decree of Peace. That appeal  by the way  was rejected by capitalist States. Peace is the basis and the immutable precept of Soviet foreign policy. It is stated in the present program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union states that ""A world without wars and without arms is the ideal of socialism."" It is also well known that the USSR has never encroached upon the political institutions of other countries  whereas the Soviet State itself has on more than one occasion been the object of armed intervention and aggression. Anti-sovietism is still felt today in political circles in some Western States. It is manifest in the unwillingness to respond in kind to the Soviet pledge not to make the first nuclear strike. Those unwilling to reciprocate understand that were they to do so the myth of communist aggressiveness would collapse and the ideological impetus that turns the dynamo of the arms race  which yields enormous profits to the military-industrial complex would be weakened.It is no less important to look for new approaches to the just settlement of regional conflicts. The cliche of East-West confrontation is inapplicable here. It is not only worn out but completely distorts the reality to which it is being applied. If there is a genuine desire to extinguish hotbeds of tension  we must tackle their socio-economic and political roots. It is there that the true source of conflicts is to be found  as well as in the denial of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence  to be free to choose their own path. Only through the solution of those root problems will it be possible to achieve genuine  just and comprehensive solutions.In the Middle East such a settlement is possible through the collective efforts of all the par ties concerned  on the basis of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the exercise of the inalienable national rights of the Arab people of Palestine  including the right to self-determination and to create their own independent State. The convening  without delay  of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PDO)  would be a constructive step along the road towards such a settlement. That is the aim of the recent Soviet proposal calling for the creation of a preparatory committee for that Conference  with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council.The peoples of Nicaragua  Afghanistan and Kampuchea have already made their choices by overthrowing anti-people regimes. All attempts to prevent them from pursuing their chosen path of building a new society should cease forthwith.The explosive situation in southern Africa also calls for an urgent political settlement. It is necessary to step up the collective search for ways of guaranteeing the security of the independent African States of the region and achieving a just settlement in Namibia without delay  in accordance with United Nations decisions. The imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the racist South African regime would be an effective step towards independence for Namibia and the elimination of the inhumane system of apartheid. It would also help in the achievement of peace and stability  in the interest of all the peoples of the region  including the white population of South Africa.The interests and aspirations of all the nations of the Mediterranean region  including Cypruss Libya and Lebanon  would be well served by the creation of a zone of stable peace and co-operation in the region.We continue our consistent support for the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to strengthen peace  bring about a relaxation of tensions in the Korean peninsula and achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea. The proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to transform that region into a nuclear-free zone could become an important element in efforts to eliminate the threat of nuclear war.The whole region of Asia and the Pacific is becoming a factor of ever-in creasing importance in world affairs. A broad proposal for ensuring security and co-operation in that region through the collective efforts of States  as put forward by the Soviet Union  is in keeping with the idea of a comprehensive system of international security.The problem of human rights must also be addressed seriously and consistently. What is necessary  is not just to mention the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  but also to work for the accession of States to such fundamental instruments in this field as the International Covenants on Human Rights  the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  and the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.Regrettably  few of those posing as the principal advocates of human rights  are to be found on the lists of States parties to those instruments. The Soviet Union has proposed that all Governments adjust their internal legislation to comply with international norms in this field. Such an action would be natural  it would seem  as natural as ABC  but the same advocates of human rights are not in a hurry to react positively.Respect for the socio-economic rights of peoples and for equal economic security for all States is also the key instrument to solve economic problems of the world. To ignore the demands for the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis without discrimination  illegal blockades and sanctions  and to praise the anarchy of the market-place  is to be out of touch with reality. One might argue that this market anarchy creates wealth. Indeed it does  but only for the few. For the rest  market anarchy reveals its other face: unemployment  illiteracy  lack of medical assistance  lack of housing  injustice in international trade  the silken strangling cord of external indebtedness  and hunger that affects entire nations. Such an order is in no way acceptable for the majority of the inhabitants of our world. The range of issues facing the united Nations is wide indeed. If they are to be resolved successfully  it is necessary to make collective efforts to increase the efficiency of the United Nations and to enhance its prestige.However  a trend to the opposite on the part of certain Western States has emerged recently  that is  to undermine the Organization  to impede its activities  to bring tough pressure to bear on some Member States and to apply arbitrary discriminatory measures against others. We are witnessing a situation whereby the United Nations is being subjected to political-financial blackmail. In any society blackmail is considered to be an abominable phenomenon  it is doubly abominable when used against this universal Organization which is the symbol of mankind's hope for a better world.What should be the position of States  if they are really seeking to promote mutual understanding and security? The present situation demands new approaches. The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Gorbachev  stressed recently:""Civilization is going through a crucial moment in its development. It is high time for all those capable of reasonable and sane thinking to adopt a clear-cut and well-defined position regardless of ideological and political differences. The machinery of mankind's self-preservation should be put into operation. There is no time to waste.""Human genius has created tremendous opportunities  and at the same time it has brought about a great threat to humanity. This dual character of today's potential emerged quite clearly against the backdrop of the accident at the Chernobyl atomic power plant  which has also affected Byelorussia; it is aggravated by the impossibility of relying entirely on technology  no matter how sophisticated it may be  which the tragic death of American astronauts and systematic failures of computers have made so painfully obvious. Matter can release tremendous amounts of energy  which  if it gets out of control  is capable of wiping out life from the face of the Earth. A nuclear war  should it break out  would lead precisely to this outcome. There is  however  the highest form of matter  which is intellect. It can prevent the irreparable. Persistent and sincere efforts by all States  and all peoples  not lip-service  are needed now to prevent the triumph of blind and merciless forces over the collective intellect of humanity. The goal of the united Nations and of the current session of the General Assembly is to mobilize such efforts.The forthcoming meeting of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Community Party of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Gorbachev  and the United States President  Ronald Reagan  which is welcomed with hope throughout the world  the success of the Stockholm Conference  the adoption by the International Atomic Energy Agency of important conventions which improve the security of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy  as well as other encouraging developments in international affairs  make us increasingly confident that it is possible to arrive at agreements in the interests of peace  security  freedom  justice and co-operation."
"17",857,"BLZ",41,1986,"The delegation of Belize congratulates Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury on his unanimous election to the high office of President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. It will not be an easy task to superintend the deliberations of such a disparate  distinctly polyglot  assembly of international statesmen; nevertheless  we rely on his wisdom  his judgment and his personal successes as an eminent diplomat to help us achieve a consensus during the coning months.I wish to record also my delegation's appreciation of the efficient manner in which the immediate past President  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  conducted the business of the Assembly during its fortieth session.I should like to say a word of thanks  too  to our Secretary-General Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. It is true that during his tenure of office increasingly complex challenges have beset the United Nations system  but it is equally true that those challenges have been confronted with the distinctive ingenuity and resourcefulness which have become the hallmarks of his tireless campaign for international peace.Our attendance at successive sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations  our participation in the discussions and the resolutions and our financial and resource contributions to the Organization and its agencies underscore the vital importance countries such as Belize attach to the United Nations system. For us  the world body continues to represent our best means of avoiding international marginalization or  worse  extinction.Because of the vulnerabilities inherent in our small size  concerns of viability continue to preoccupy Belize. In our own region we are especially susceptible to a geo-political environment grown increasingly hostile to any degree of neutrality  but the United Nations provides a forum for the sustained consultation and concerted action necessary to help preserve the sovereignty  territorial integrity  peace and welfare of small States. There are other regional mechanisms of first resort but in our view they are essentially complementary to the collective authority of this truly international forum  which in the final analysis offers the most effective guarantee that the law of the jungle will not prevail in world affairs.It was in that context that Caribbean Community foreign ministers  meeting in Belize in June of this year  expressed concern about the continued erosion of the principle of multilateralism. They reaffirmed that the multilateral process was essential for small  developing States  such as those in the Caribbean. They noted with concern the trend towards unilateralism which has been reflected in the bypassing of the United Nations system  the withdrawal of membership from a number of United Nations bodies and the diminished support for regional institutions.They also pointed out that the financial crisis facing the international organizations  arising from the unilateral withholding of assessed budgetary contributions by some countries  threatened the integrity of those organizations  and they called on all States to give full support to the multilateral process.The dynamics of international life have undergone a dramatic change since the drafting of the Charter. In particular  the years following the General Assembly's Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in 1960 have seen the phenomenon of the micro-State become an accepted feature of the international landscape. Now  fully a quarter century after that seminal Declaration  the time has surely come for a reaffirmation of the principle of sovereign equality which inspired the Declaration. Such a reaffirmation should find expression in the kind of a political reform to the Unite*' Nations system that would give a more muscular  a more practical concretization to the presumption of dignity for small  newly independent States.Whatever proposals emerge for the strengthening of the United Nations system must take account of the fundamental need of small States to be involved actively in the international community  not with a limited spectator status but as equal participants in the real work of the international system. Hence membership of the Security Council  for example  can no longer be the preserve of the large and the powerful but must reflect the evolutionary nature of international reality. States large and small should be accommodated on a manageable rotation basis so as to allow all nations the benefit of constructive participation  regardless of wealth or military power.Reform  of course  is not a one-way street. If the third world countries which make up the bulk of the United Nations membership are to persuade the great Powers to be responsive to the need for a more egalitarian framework for the Security Council they must also be prepared to exercise the power of their majority in the General Assembly with restraint and responsibility.In particular  those of us who belong to the non-aligned group of nations should use our force of numbers to act in an unbiased fashion as regards the super-Powers and their respective world views and alliances. Too often it appears that our positions are anything but non-aligned. We need to put our own house in order and get back to a situation in which we apply the principles of our movement uniformly and without selectivity. The General Assembly ought not to be a forum for sterile agenda and one-sided resolutions  rammed home by what increasingly appears to be an unbalanced use of our majority.I turn now to the question of economic relations. There is also the need here for a more equitable dead  for small countries  in the context of both bilateral and multilateral arrangements.In consequence of our particular culture and history  and as a matter of mature political choice  Belize has opted for parliamentary democracy as the means best suited to the organization of our society  but we recognize the fragility of political democracy when it is not accompanied by economic democracy. My Government has therefore sought assiduously to bring material betterment to our people  and we have made great strides in the year just passed to put our fiscal house in order  restore our dollar to stability  arrest capital flight  cope with the burdens of debt servicing  market our tourism resources and create export-led growth.Our economy  however  like most of the economies of the developing world  is still in a state of dependence. There is therefore a continuing need on our part for private capital flows  as well as official aid on concessionary terms and non-reciprocal preferential access to international markets. He look to developed countries for these supports  developed countries with which we share a kinship born of common traditions and similar political and social organization. He also seek through them access to the multilateral commercial and financial organizations.Paradoxical though it may seem  even as we seek the co-operation and assistance of these col tries we jealously guard our political independence and our dignity. He in Belize wish to pursue our own interests  going in the democratic direction to which our circumstances and our philosophy incline us  but without becoming the ideological bag and baggage of any Power. We do not suffer from a Manichean view of things  but attempt rather to order our relations with others on the basis of non-interference and respect for the right of all peoples to freely determine their own destinies.Because of our position  we view with concern the attempts of some powerful countries to make over weaker States in their own image  and in particular their use of the promise of increased aid  or the threat of reduced aid  as a carrot and stick method of exacting compliance with their prevailing orthodoxy.Of course all this merely points up the dangers inherent in economic dependence  which smaller States on their own are powerless to affect  but which leads to and intensifies other forms of dependence: diplomatic  security  cultural  psychological  and intellectual. Since the inequity of the present state of economic relations between powerful countries and small countries so palpably lessens the sovereignty of the latter  we join once again in endorsing the call for a new international economic order as one truly efficacious way of achieving that equality which should be the ideal of all of us.Here again  though  the call for a new international economic order ought not to be accompanied by the self-defeating rhetoric which blames all of the ills of the developing countries on the developed world. Merely demanding the transfer of resources from the rich to the poor  together with excoriating multinational companies and first-world protectionism  cannot be a substitute for the imaginative and realistic proposals which the Group of 77 ought to be putting forward. Such proposals should concentrate on the measures which developing countries themselves can take to free their economies and spur growth  as well as on what is needed to redress the imbalances in international trade  regulate commodity prices and encourage technology transfers.Just as we seek to assert our own sovereignty and independence of action as a developing Caribbean State in Central America  so too we insist on the need for the preservation of the sovereignty and democratic self-determination of neighboring States in our region  particularly those under seige or threats from other countries.My Government reaffirms its strong support for the continuing efforts of the Contadora countries and the Support Group to seek a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Central America. We are convinced that other countries with interest and influence in the region can best advance the cause of peace  security and development in Central America by supporting the Contadora process as the most likely means of achieving a resolution of the conflict. We call on regional protagonists to resist the designs of those who would exploit the situation in an effort to gain advantage in the East-West struggle for global supremacy.In Belize's own case  my Government is prepared to do all it can to forestall any addition to regional tension by working for the removal of the obstacles which prevent the Government of Guatemala from recognizing the sovereignty and territorial inviolability of Belize. Belizeans welcome the return to civilian rulein Guatemala as a forerunner of the normalization of relations between our two countries. We are confident that the climate now exists for direct negotiations which will enable both parties to find a lasting solution to a problem that retards the development of harmonious relations between two peoples equally desirous of continued liberty. On the basis of our shared commitment to democracy  we appeal to the new Government of Guatemala to be flexible and realistic in future discussions with Belize. Such discussions should explore ways of arriving at a solution which recognizes Belizean independence and Belize's right to maintain and preserve its present and constitutional borders  while at the same time addressing the legitimate security concerns of Guatemala.We are heartened to note the efforts currently being made to resolve the problems between our sister Caribbean Community (CARICOM) country  Guyana  and its Latin American neighbor  Venezuela. In concert with the Caribbean Community  Belize encourages these two countries to continue their search for a peaceful solution  and to continue to co-operate with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in fulfilling the mandate provided by the Geneva Agreement.We note also the revision of the charter of the Organization of American States which took place at Cartagena in December of last year. It is a revision which takes account of current realities  recognizes the principle of hemispheric universality and opens the way for Belize and Guyana's full membership in the organization by 1990. My Government takes this opportunity to express its appreciation to all those States that spearheaded the revision exercise. By their action  they have recorded their conviction that sovereign Belize can no longer fa-deprived of its rightful place among the community of nations that make up the Organization of American States.The delegation of Belize is acutely aware that the problems of Belize  both domestic and international  as well as the problems of the region  cannot be isolated from the broader global questions that affect our existence in an increasingly interdependent world.We cannot be silent  therefore  at the anguished cries of the black majority in South Africa  and we join our voice to the chorus of condemnation which demands an end to abhorrent apartheid.Apartheid continues to be a state policy in South Africa because it is allowed to remain so by those in a position to influence change. The appeal for comprehensive sanctions against the Pretoria regime must be met by all countries  particularly those who have been reluctant to move resolutely in the past  and particularly those whose economic and financial empires continue to give comfort and succor to the mindless racists in South Africa. The kind of diplomacy which elevates considerations of realpolitik over a commitment to oppressed humanity must be rejected now.By its illegal occupation of Namibia  too. South Africa continues to stretch the patience of world opinion. The United Nations has been seized of the plight of the Namibian people for over 40 years now  and 20 years ago the General Assembly terminated South Africa's Mandate over that hapless country. Yet  encouraged by those whose policies continue to be on the wrong side of history. South Africa has found one transparent reason after another to defy the international community and hold Namibia in bondage. The time has come for an end to this humiliating charade. Namibia must be independent and room must be made in this Hall for the delegation of independent Namibia.The continued aggravation of the situation in the Middle East is of great concern to Belize. Among the family of nations none has had to struggle for theright to maintain a State as bravely and enduringly as has Israel. Accordingly  few should be able to appreciate the intensity of the Palestinian cause as should Israel. The problem of Palestine is at the core of the crisis in the Middle East  and there can be victory for neither Arab nor Israeli until the central fact of the need for a Palestinian homeland is recognized equally with respect for the right of Israel to live in peace and security within its own borders.The convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East points one way forward. That Conference should be without pre-conditions if it is not be be bogged down in preliminary wrangling and maneuvering. The terrorism that is so charged with the fire to ignite another Middle East war has no constructive contribution to offer either the convening or the success of this Conference. We therefore applaud the Cairo Declaration of 11 November 1985  which rejects and denounces terrorism.The situation in Afghanistan is pregnant with dangerous consequences for the stability of that region. For over four years millions of Afghans have fled their hones and suffered indignity  inhumanity and death following the invasion of their country. My Government appeals to the parties involved to bring this conflict to an end. A settlement should include withdrawal of foreign troops and ensure full respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned statue  of Afghanistan.The situation in Kampuchea continues to occupy the attention of the General Assembly. We appeal to all sides to accept the recent proposal for a phased withdrawal of foreign troops  a cease-fire and participatory elections under United Nations supervision. A more workable solution to the problem is unlikely to be found  and we urge Viet Nam to show its commitment to peace in the region by acting on this proposal.Belize continues to hope that the divided Korean people will some day be unified. Such unification  however  requires dialog and negotiation between North and South Korea  the parties directly concerned. It is important that tension and hostility between the two countries be replaced with mutual trust and national reconciliation.Peace must also come between the non-aligned States of Iran and Iraq. Their peoples deserve no less. Lebanon must cease to be a theater of fratricide and manipulation by outside elements. And the Falkland islanders and the people of Western Sahara must have their right to self-determination respected.The world continues to be plagued with regional conflicts even though our humanity obliges us to yearn for peace. That peace is made even more elusive by the proliferation and threats of use of nuclear weapons. It is all too apparent that the vast majority of States mentors of the international community have neither the desire to manufacture or possess nuclear weapons  nor the capability of doing so. Yet our survival is universally threatened by the spread of these weapons  while the general acceptance of the principle of nuclear-free zones gives some comfort to small nations  the international community should not rest until the relevant Powers agree to a new concept of global security that would eschew the use of nuclear weapons.Tto the possibility of nuclear Armageddon and the proliferation of conventional conflicts must be added a third threat to world peace: the production and trafficking in dangerous drugs  which  in its devastation  has taken on the equivalence of war. Belize applauds all efforts aimed at the elimination of drugs at their source of supply  in transit and at their destination. The problem of drug production  trafficking and abuse has reached a level where it demands a disproportionate share of the social and economic resources of developing countries in order to contain its ill effects. Nevertheless  we in Belize have strengthened national legislation  applied the power of the courts and law enforcement agencies and have initiated Programs aimed at prevention of drug abuse and at rehabilitation as well as at the elimination of production. Only effective regional and international action taken by producing countries  by transit countries and by consumer countries acting in concert can best address this problem. Belize therefore reiterates its commitment to co-operate bilaterally  regionally and inter nation ally in all efforts to develop and execute a coherent response to this threat to our society  our security and our sanity.International stability requires respect for a world order  for basic rules that are practical as well as moral. The United Nations system  the deliberations of the General Assembly reinforce that order and give effect to those rules. Every problem solved  every conflict prevented  every life saved because of our presence here provides evidence that  however imperfectly  our Organization works. Let the world never forget that in its ideals  in its practices and in its Charter(Mr. Barrow  Belize)the United Nations system is the great bulwark preventing the horror of a Hobbesian vision from becoming the central reality of international affairs."
"18",904,"BOL",41,1986," I wish to congratulate you. Sir  on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. This was a wise choice and represents a tribute by the international community to you. and to the noble people of Bangladesh.At the same time I wish to express the deep gratitude of my country to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for the sincere and effective way in which he has shown his concern about and understanding of the difficult situation in Bolivia. This is evidence of the outstanding human qualities and high degree of responsiveness of the holder of the highest executive position in the world Organization.I also wish to point out the fruitful work done by Ambassador Jaime de Pinies as President of the General Assembly at its fortieth session.In celebrating the International Year of Peace my Government joins all the other nations of the world in striving to promote and consolidate international peace and security.The expansion of nuclear and conventional arsenals and the improvement of the technologies of death presents a monstrous and terrible threat  that is becoming increasingly dangerous to world peace  and inimical to the urgent development needs of the countries located in the hemisphere of backwardness.The waste of the resources that we need for the economic and social development of most of mankind is constantly growing. Aware of that  Bolivia firmly supports all disarmament initiatives aimed at preserving international peaceand security  and it urges the world Powers to do everything they can to maintain dialog and creative thinking that could lead to general and complete disarmament under effective international control.We also support the strengthening and consolidation of a new international global order of peace and well being for all the peoples of the world  an order in which the goal of international social justice is an attainable goal and not merely a Utopian dream.The world economic situation has resulted in the loss of substantial resources that could have been used in the development of third-world countries  which are sinking to the ground under the heavy burden of foreign debt  which has reached insupportable levels. The economic recession that has resulted from the extreme austerity measures many of our Governments have had to adopt has widened the enormous gap that separates us from the industrial countries in world economic relations. Furthermore  external debt is more than a financial matter; it is above all an ethical and political question.It has been recognized that there is an imperative need to adopt urgent measures to bring about new forms of coexistence and world economic relationships. We must demand that responsibility be shared by debtors and creditors  and that there be fairness and symmetry in bearing the cost of economic adjustments within a global framework in order to bring about the revitalization of the process of effective and continuous development in our countries. However  ironic as it may seem  despite all our hopes we see economic chauvinism and protectionism in world trade taking a stronger hold.The Republic of Bolivia wishes to take this opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to the principles of the Charter  which are fundamental to the defense of national sovereignty and the right of self-determination in the context of a world of peace and security. Unfortunately those principles are constantly being violated as international laws are flouted.The predominance of power for power's sake is reckless and yet prevails  and the ethical principles which make peace the very essence of civilized life become ever more distant.In Central America we must put an end to courteous rhetoric on the part of leaders who talk while people are dying and while the economic future of Salvadorians and Nicaraguans is being dealt a crushing blow. He are treading a dangerous path where lack of feeling and callousness put the whole human race to shame.My Government considers that peace alternatives must be strengthened. It supports the action of the Contadora Group and the Support Group since this is what Latin America wants in order to find a peaceful and lasting solution in the region. But this solution must come here and now. The main characters in this tragedy must sit together and unilaterally negotiate without entering into ideological confrontation and motivated solely by a love of peace.Developments in the Middle East are another intolerable disgrace. Bolivia  while maintaining its principled position in favor of the full exercise of sovereignty and self-determination of peoples  reiterates its support for resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly on the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence. Nevertheless  this does not imply disregard for the State of Israel  which must have secure and recognized boundaries in the international context.He wish to highlight the intensive work done by united Nations bodies in seeking peaceful and definitive solutions  which must be coraplied with by the opposing States.Bolivia also wishes to urge Iran and Iraq to end the military conflagration which has been dragging on since 1980 and which has only brought about serious economic losses and unspeakable human tragedy in both countries.Another problem which is cause for concern at the international level is the tense situation in the Mediterranean. Despite the Secretary-General's efforts to find a solution through dialog between the parties to the conflict  he has so far not succeeded. On this question the Government of Bolivia recognizes only the legally established Government in Cyprus and reaffirms its respect for that country's sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity.The tragic situations in Kampuchea and Afghanistan offer sorry proof of irrationality and insensibility on an international scale  with serious implications for peace and stability on the Asian continent. The United Nations must therefore further endeavor to bring about a permanent settlement of disputes and a zone of security in these regions.My Government is opposed to foreign interference in the internal affairs of States and  accordingly  urges the countries concerned to engage in effective negotiations aimed at finding a permanent political solution based on the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops and full respect for independence and territorial integrity.What it is a matter of defending the freedom of peoples subjected to a system which is an affront to human dignity  such as a par theid  my country once again wishes to express its strong condemnation of all forms of discrimination among human beings. Th is has been proved in our support for united Nations resolutions on this subject.I wish further to reiterate Bolivia's categorical support for the struggle waged by the people of Namibia for its freedom aid independence. My country recognizes the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) as the only present legitimate representative of the Namibian people and respects the heroic struggle it wages in defense of its natural resources and all the rights inherent in a sovereign  free and independent State.Our Organization has played a major role against colonialism .in Africa  Asia and Latin America. The harsh and exhausting road to liberation and the independence of peoples still under colonial regimes must be a constant objective of the international community if it is to be more just.In this context we must also include the question of Gibraltar  the last colonial enclave in Europe. My country welcomes sincerely the announcement of negotiations between the Kingdoms of Spain and Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Likewise  Bolivia has always recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of Argentina over the Malvinas islands. Firm in its commitment to peace  we support all negotiations between the Republic of Argentina and the United Kingdom aimed at reaching a just and peaceful settlement of the dispute. On the other hand  we oppose the militarization and nuclearization of that area of the South Atlantic.Bolivia  my country  has fallen victim to the greatest economic catastrophe of its life as a republic. In recent years it has suffered  for the seventh time  the highest rate of inflation ever known in the history of man  the most devastating in this century. Its effects are similar to the damage caused by international war or a terrible internal civil war.Upon taking over the reins of our constitutional Government in August 1985  President Victor Paz Estenssoro had to face a 25 000 per cent annual rate of inflation  a shattered industrial economy and a constantly and recklessly growing informal economy tainted by criminal links  such as drug trafficking.Bolivia thus became a country in ruins  without monetary reserves and with growing unemployment. It seemed that it had been placed in a state of siege by dual Powers sponsored by a dogmatic  extremist  maximalist and aggressive left.The reconstruction of the country was begun without any international assistance. Through our own efforts and through severe austerity measures  the national Government carried out a new economic policy of which the first  and surprising  results - unprecedented in Latin America - were to curb hyperinflation  bringing it down from an incredible 25 000 per cent to practically zero at present.However  that political action of true national salvation fell victim once again to international aggression. First  this was due to the fall in the price of tin as a result of the collapse of the International Tin Council in October 1985. Secondly  our foreign trade and international payments  because of this crisis and that affecting other minerals  suffered damage amounting to more than 60 per cent  which meant a real reduction in the over-all economy of the country. Thirdly  to all this must be added the crisis in oil prices which  while favoring the rich  deals mortal blows to producing countries  which are generally among the poorest countries of the world.The case of Bolivia is a cruel and clear example of international injustice  of the awesome power of the market-place and of the lack of responsiveness on the part of powerful plutocratic centers. These are not rhetorical assertions. They are born of the experiences of a country that has been wounded both physically and biologically by the actions of a self-satisfied and hegemonistic world system.Beginning with the difficult and aggressive therapy that my people and their economic policy have applied to the cancer of hyperinflation  we have managed in some degree to sensitize world public opinion. In that regard  I should like to stress the generous and courageous personal actions of our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.That very dramatic proof has led in concrete terms to bilateral co-operation with friendly countries which  in fraternal solidarity  are supporting Bolivia. We wish to thank them and to express our deep satisfaction.Furthermore  our Program has been well received and taken seriously by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We trust that  with its co-operation and any other co-operation we may receive  we shall be able to initiate a process of economic recovery while maintaining the democratic system currently prevailing in Bolivia  in the midst of this Dantesque picture of suffering and destruction.It is precisely in the context of this hyper inflationary chaos that Bolivia has had to bear the additional malignancy of drug trafficking which  as an important element of the informal economy  had been growing and spreading its tentacles of vice into the economic  social and moral institutions of the Bolivian people. As a result  President Paz Estenssoro took the historic decision to fight ruthlessly against this form of organized crime.At this time  the Republic of Bolivia  with technical and logistical support from the Department of Justice of the United States of America  is waging a real war against that outrage - against that new form of slavery  as drug crime was wisely defined by His Holiness John Paul II. This effort is also an inescapable duty for countries in which the consumption of narcotic drugs is considerable. Otherwise  countries like Bolivia would be powerless in the face of the domestic expansion of this reprehensible product.For these essentially ethical reasons  Bolivia most strongly encourages the success of the international conference that has been convened by the Secretary-General for next year in Vienna. We are certain that this world gathering will mark a starting-point for the elimination of this terrible scourge from the face of the earth.On behalf of my country I urge the entire international community to take an active part in this crusade. In particular  I urge the industrialized countries  whose young people have to a greater or lesser degree been suffering from this terrible vice and organized crime  to take an active part in this struggle. If the community of nations does not become aware of this global curse  we will be jeopardizing the ethical bases of contemporary civilization and allowing the financial strength of the mafias to enslave our institutions  our way of life  our families and our very human ethic  which is deeply rooted in our souls and which we wish to recover  above all other considerations of the moment.We also wish to warn of the need for joint action to curb terrorism regardless of its ideological motivation.Furthermore  the global crisis of our universal organization - the United Nations - requires the most careful attention of all Member States  if we wish to ensure its survival  which we consider essential to the maintenance of peace and coexistence among all the countries of the earth  we cannot allow a manifest and unworthy conspiracy to try to damage by various means the validity and force of this beacon of world peace and security  our Organization.Bolivia confidently supports the arduous efforts of the Secretary-General to overcome the serious obstacles we have cited and calls upon all States  particularly the large industrial countries  to lend active understanding and backing to the structural consolidation of the United Nations and its permanent institutional values.The law of nations  the very essence of civilized life  based on dialog and understanding between States  is based  in doctrine and in historical practice  on the maintenance of a moral order embodied in the principle of peace and plenty.This aspect of respect for international instruments also finds affirmation in the principle that the review of treaties  their updating and modernization and consideration of future implications must be the subject of negotiation. These treaties must also be enriched  improved and perfected so that there may be more harmony and understanding in inter-State relations.This consideration of principle is of special application in Latin America  which is undergoing an intensive process of renewal with regard to inter-State relations. Proof of this is the recent conclusion of treaties between industrialized Powers and developing countries  which supersede old  anachronistic statutes born of colonialism and neo-colonialism.In this context  Latin America is keeping a watchful eye on the faithful and timely implementation of one of those treaties - that which returns full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone to its legitimate owner.The international community  and basically the United Nations  the Organization of American States (OAS) aid the Non-Aligned Movement  has in recent years faced a problem of dramatic significance for the very essence of Bolivia's history and life. I am referring to the maritime problem of our situation of inferiority because of our having become a land-locked country  and to the significance of this situation in hampering and impeding our possibilities of development.We will not reiterate once again the origins of this unfair situation; nor will we bring up background details or precedents from a past of more than 100 years  which since the Pacific war of 1879 have not contributed to a solution of the natter. But I wish to take this opportunity to say that Bolivia and its people express their gratitude to all the nations of the world which have became aware of this matter  expressed interest and  in various forums and debates advocated efforts to find a satisfactory solution through peaceful negotiations carried out sincerely and responsibly.It was precisely in response to those brotherly exhortations that President Paz Estenssoro  in a historic act of openhandedness  expressed his desire that this important problem be the subject of negotiations and be dealt with in valid and clear political terms.At the intellectual level  based on precept of the Liberator  Simon Bolivar  the founder of Bolivia  regarding understanding and complementarity among Latin Americans  we have initiated with the Government of the Republic of Chile the first contacts aimed at finding a negotiated solution to a problem that must be resolved  a question the handling of which requires the greatest measure of political will and oecumenical spirit on the part of peoples committed to justice and world peace.It is our hope that this beginning between Chile and Bolivia will lead to sure progress  because we think we have found in the present circumstances the right moment to achieve objectives of mutual benefit to our countries  based on the philosophy of the unity and integration of Latin America.The dialog that we advocate is based on understanding and brotherhood  without rancor  without vengeance  without yearning for a past which is history  albeit true and relevant history. That history teaches us not to repeat mistakes  not to fall into the trap of irrational prejudice  but  rather  with vigour and imagination  to open up and pursue new possibilities of finding a peaceful solution to this important problem. This is what we are undertaking and announcing with satisfaction to the world community."
"19",951,"BRA",41,1986," On behalf of the Brazilian Government it is my privilege to congratulate you. Sir  upon your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. I am certain that I interpret the trust of all delegations present here in your wise and inspired leadership  on the basis of which our work will attain the desired success.Let me also pay tribute to Ambassador Jaime de Pinies for the competent and skillful manner in which he presided over the last session of the General Assembly  the session which marked the fortieth anniversary of our Organization.For 41 years Brazil has had the privilege of opening the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly.At the fortieth session last September it was the President of my country  Jose Sarney  who gave the opening address. He began by paying homage to this tribune:""This tribune instills respect and dignity. It is the loftiest in the community of nations. Here both the mighty and the weak are diminished"". In my capacity as Minister for External Relations of Brazil  I come to this podium of the United Nations with emotion and reverence. This is the highest forum of mankind. As such it must be resolutely preserved. I spare no words  therefore  in praising it. Its occasional setbacks do not detract from its intrinsic value as an instrument for dialog and peace. Its shortcomings  far from rendering it invalid  rather enhance the imperative need to strengthen it.Brazil knows of no alternative to the United Nations. If the Organization did not exist  human talent and ingenuity would have to conceive it  create it - in short  reinvent it. It certainly does not lack adequate institutional means  a precise legal framework  or clearly defined and lucid objectives. Truly  what is most missing in the Organization  to translate all its immense potential into the most profitable co-operation between peoples for their common good  is a sincere political universal will to sustain it without faltering in the consistent and dedicated affirmation of the noble purposes consecrated in the San Francisco Charter.Just when international society is becoming practically universal  it would be contradictory  as well as foolhardy  to condemn the United Nations to extinction or to inertia  thus depriving the world of its basic tools for democratic dialog and fruitful understanding.For Brazil  strengthening the United Nations is the best way to ensure peace  security and international co-operation.During his recent State visit to the United States of America  President Jose Sarney referred to Brazil as a factor for stability and peace  for conciliation and equilibrium in all dimensions of world order. ""He are a country that contributes""  he said  ""a country that does not disrupt - a country that brings not problems but solutions"". I have come to the United Nations to convey  with certainty and conviction  the responsible and constructive message of a new Brazil  a Brazil that is celebrating its return to democracy  and  with renewed vigour  with decisiveness and assurance  is undergoing significant changes.The balance sheet of the 18 months of the new Brazilian Republic is. impressive; we have consolidated our political institutions  removing the last traces of authoritarianism  and making room for a progressive and irreversible democracy  a full  open  modern and united society.We have corrected inflationary distortions that for decades have afflicted our people - and did so without a recession  but on the contrary  with rapid and firm resumption of economic growth. We have begun to settle our chief debt - the social debt  the historical debt the country owes to its own people  by actively seeking to reduce disparities in income and to wipe out poverty.Just like the nation we have set ourselves to build  we want to have a politically democratic international order  economically prosperous and sharing  socially just. We want liberty  development  equity. It does not appear  however  that these aspirations are even close to being fulfilled. On the contrary  on the political level  the trend towards rebipolarization undermines the international machinery for collective and democratic understanding. Confrontation is replacing dialog  power is prevailing over consensus. The threat of force  and even the use of force  are replacing the tools for negotiation in dealing with disputes - as if power  per se  were efficient in settling conflicts. Where force is present today impasse is more frequent than victory or defeat. Force  besides being illegal  has proved itself to be non-functional.The historian who in the last century foretold that the twentieth century would be the century of terrible simplification was right. The vast complexity of international relations is imprisoned in trivial schematizations that divide countries according to the easy logic of dichotomies  separating them into different and necessarily opposed camps  seeking to obliterate the spontaneous multi-polarity of the world of today.Reality itself is richer and more contradictory  and has resisted the authoritarianism of binary concepts. But Manichean dualism can be-perverse and end up imposing itself upon reality. To deal with a local dispute  brought about by local causes  on the basis of preconceptions and interests embodied in the confrontation between exogenous Powers  can unleash forces that will end up transposing a minor dispute into the major conflict. Although fallacious in their premises  these concepts can be catastrophic in their consequences. What was false as a principle in application becomes painfully true - and all the more serious.The international economic system is conducted by anachronistic automatisms which are in conflict with the interests of a good portion of the international community - primarily the developing countries. In the field of trade  rules to prevail which first and foremost reflect the interests of the roost powerful industrial nations - and even these rules are frequently violated. In the financial and monetary fields  the world economy is subject to the impact of measures taken unilaterally that can decisively affect the developing countries without their having any rights - neither the right to speak  nor the right to argue  nor the right to compensation.As regards equity  the hoped-for reduction of the deep gap between rich and poor countries  we are witnessing the almost total paralyzation of international economic co-operation. The initiatives taken by the developing countries run into the inertia and even the hostility of the developed countries. On the other hand  there is an accentuation of trade protectionism on the part of these countries  an iniquitous practice made even more so by being incorrectly compared with the legitimate measures that developing countries need to adopt in order to protect their infant national production. There is an unmistakable difference between one kind of behavior and the other: one preserves the concentration of wealth  sustaining non-competitive activities? the other seeks to guarantee the survival of the poorest countries in an unjust and unbalanced international system that even obliges them to accumulate ever larger surpluses for the payment of their foreign financial commitments.And worse  a new model of protectionism is emerging. The action of barring inconvenient imports is now being complemented by the strategy of creating obstacles to the very installation of production processes in the developing countries  even when primarily intended to meet the demand of the internal market. This ""preventive"" protectionism is particularly evident in sectors which involve the use of more advanced technologies. The climate of international relations does not  therefore  look very favorable for developing countries such as Brazil  However  this does not discourage us from persevering in our quest for the objectives we set for ourselves at home  nor does it lessen our willingness to participate in any endeavor leading to a truly more free  prosperous and just international society - such as the society we firmly propose to establish in our own country.I cannot fail to mention here the Ministerial Meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  in Punta del Este  in which I have just participated. At that meeting I stressed the firmness of positions and the constructive attitude of the developing countries.Brazil trusts that the consensus eventually reached may serve as a starting-point for fruitful and profitable negotiations for the international community as a whole  leading to a more just and effective economic order.Latin America is heroically struggling to extricate itself from an economic crisis at the precise moment at which its democratic vocation is solidly reasserting itself.Despite the progress that some Latin American countries  such.as Brazil  have succeeded in making at the economic and social levels  the general picture of our continent still presents serious difficulties - recession  unemployment and heavy foreign indebtedness. I am reminded of the famous words of Simon Bolivar  to whom our continent owes so much:""Slavery is the daughter of darkness; an ignorant population is the blind tool of its own destruction."" The Liberator would agree today that the blind population in the deep night of poverty can just as easily become the tool of revolt and destabilization.The present juncture calls for statesmanlike vision. Just as was the case after the Second World War  it is now necessary and of the utmost urgency to take concrete action to launch an authentic new international economic order.We also stand in need of short-term measures. Latin America cannot continue being a net exporter of capital; it cannot continue paying high interest rates and spreads in renegotiating its foreign debts; it can no longer have access to international markets blocked for its products; nor can it continue to suffer from restrictions on the transfer of technology.*The keen awareness of the economic problems of Latin America led to the establishment of the Cartagena consensus  through which we issued an invitation to the creditor nations for dialog and understanding.It is essential that the crisis of Latin American indebtedness be analyzed and understood from its political aspect. It is essential that the Governments of the creditor countries understand that an exceptional situation exists  a situation that cannot be automatically corrected by the simple play of the market forces. It is essential to understand that there is a need to contain and correct patent distortions and inequalities in the international economic system.President Sarney has declared again and again that Brazil will not pay its foreign debt with the hunger and poverty of its people  nor at the cost of democracy or economic growth. In reaffirming this resolute stand of the Government of Brazil  I do so in the name of a country determined to fulfill its international financial commitments but equally determined to secure a better quality of life for its people  who have already made so many sacrifices.It was with this superior objective in mind that in February of this year Brazil adopted a broad program for economic reform  to crush inflation  stimulate investments  reward production and labor and penalize speculation. The new program  the highly successful Piano Cruzado  or Cruzado Plan  is today the symbol of new hope for Brazilians  embodying a new mentality  a new force to give impetus to our growth.There is no longer any terra incognita on this planet; but new frontiers are being opened up in areas that are crucial for humanity: those of technology.The developing world cannot be kept as an outsider in this new revolution  lest the already enormous chasm that separates our world from the developed world be consolidated and broadened. The technological revolution must be channeled towards the bridging of these two worlds  so that it will benefit both. The effects of this revolution are exponential and qualitative in character. If they are misdirected  they can not only cause an irreversible rift between rich and poor but also inevitably lead to an abyss separating those who possess and control knowledge from those to whom no access to knowledge is permitted.We do not wish  nor can we accept  the technological revolution's following the same road as the Industrial Revolution  relegating the majority of countries to the role of mere providers of inputs of limited aggregate value. Nor do we wish to be reduced to the role of mere buyers of the surplus and the obsolete.We will not resign ourselves to being the passive spectators of a new international division of labor  bisecting the world into distinct universes  one containing the post-industrial societies  where activities of information and service predominate  true nerve centres that would govern the planet  and the other for backward  subservient societies.Neither do we fail to see the implications of the accelerated development of new technologies for military purposes in the rich countries. We are aware of the impact of the civilian applications of these new technologies  whose research and development are endlessly financed by defense budgets. We are not blind to the repercussions that these subsidies to technology have on the entire economic structure of the developed countries  nor do we fail to perceive their negative effect on the competitive capacity of the economies of the developing countries.In Latin America  in particular  the economic and technological lag is spurring the conscience of our peoples. In Brazil we are firmly  irreversibly committed to the cause of the economic integration of Latin America. Por a long time this integration has been called for  but only now do we have adequate conditions for the emergence of an authentic political will to further it. Integration opens up horizons for the formation of a common Latin American space  conducive to the development of the countries of the region and capable of invigorating them as they confront the adversities of the international economic situation. Brazil  together with Argentina and Uruguay  recently took meaningful steps towards this integration  in agreements that set forth  unequivocally  the mature and intelligent decision of peoples thoroughly convinced of the advantages of their uniting. An ambitious decision  but realistic as well  in which renewed faith in the convergence of our destinies is coupled with complete awareness of the difficulties integration can bring  we  however  do not flinch from taking up this historic challenge  which we know is daunting  but its very magnitude is the measure of our common willingness to co-operate and to progress - our fraternal aspiration to grow  and to do so together.The continuing existence of regional crises that threaten peace and security is another important aspect on the international scene.A notable instance is what is happening in southern Africa. I am reminded of the words of President Sarney  in Praia  when he paid a gratifying visit to Cape Verde last Mays""The complex problems of South Africa can never be solved from the perspective of East-West tensions nor from any other strategic viewpoint of the great Powers. ... The solution to the crisis in that region lies first of all in the disappearance of apartheid and  subsequently  in the solid implantation of a structure of peaceful interaction between the States of the region  enabling all of them to dedicate themselves to the struggle for the implementation of their. national development plans.""The inconceivable recalcitrance of the Pretoria Government in maintaining the regime of apartheid intact and in blocking the process of the independence of Namibia in persistent violation of the Security Council's decision continues to provoke serious tensions and conflicts in southern Africa.An illustrious Brazilian statesman of the past century  Joaguim Nabuco  fighting against the slavery that stigmatized us at that time  said all those years ago:""the laws of every country are subject to certain fundamental principles  which are the basis of civilized societies  and the violation of which in any one of those societies amounts to an offense against all the others"".""No State can thus place itself outside the civilized community of the world""  asserted that famous abolitionist. This is exactly the case of the abominable regime of discrimination still in effect in South Africa as we approach the third millennium.The international community is on the threshold of decisions that can no longer be postponed if Pretoria's attempt to perpetuate its nefarious regime is to be rendered unfeasible. Brazil will continue to strive to create conditions for the settlement of that question - an undeniable priority in the light of the explosive situation in South Africa and the critical situation of the front-line countries  which are subjected to every kind of illegal and unjustifiable aggression. Those valiant and long-suffering nations have our steadfast support.In the Middle East  the cycle of violence continues unabated. Brazil reiterates its consternation at the attacks being carried out in Lebanon  a country with which we have traditional ties and whose full right to self-determination we would wish to see respected.The bases for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East must of necessity include the return of the Arab territories occupied since 1967  respect for the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence in their own territory  and the need for all the States of the region  including Israel  to live in peace within internationally recognized borders.Brazil is also following with concern the development of the conflict between '.van and Iraq. We deeply regret that those two countries have not as yet resolved their differences peacefully and we renew our appeal for an immediate cessation of hostilities.Chronic crises and conflicts are also to be found in other parts of the world. Such is the case in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  where the right toself-determination and the principle of non-intervention are being violated. Violence in those regions will not cease so long as foreign occupation continues and the free expression of the will of the people is curbed.Another issue which preoccupies Brazil and the other Latin American countries is that of the Malvinas Islands. Since 1833  we have clearly and unswervingly supported the sovereign rights .1 the Argentine Republic to that territory and have insisted on the need for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the dispute. It is essential that a dialog be re-established between the parties involved.In Central America  exacerbated economic and social problems of a structural nature continue to add to the persistent climate of tension heightened by ideological confrontation. Brazil remains firmly convinced that a lasting solution to the conflict can be achieved only by respecting the principles of non-intervention and of the self-determination of peoples in an atmosphere of dialog and mutual understanding. As a result of that conviction  my country has sought to co-operate in reaching an understanding through its participation in the Contadora peace process Support Group.When we met in San Francisco to draw up the Charter of the United Nations  we were concerned chiefly with finding a definition for the kind of world we would be bequeathing to future generations. Shortly thereafter  an apocalyptic event radically changed the very premises on which the negotiations for a new international order were based.The explosion of the first atomic bomb at Hiroshima revealed mankind to be in possession of a weapon capable of destroying the human species as well as the whole world in which we live. Since then  the problem of nuclear weapons has only worsened. Each day  the risk of. a global - global and final - conflict increases.The process action and reaction  that has taken the lethal and spiraling arms race to ever higher levels is indeed frightening. The prospect that an arms race is to be unleashed in space also causes us deep apprehension.Brazil maintains a firm and determined policy of opposition to the proliferation of nuclear arms  whether vertical or horizontal. We have actively participated in all efforts towards disarmament carried out by United Nations forums.My country signed and ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco  the purpose of which is to make Latin America the first militarily denuclearized zone in territory inhabited by man.The Treaty of Tlatelolco has not as yet achieved its objective  for it is not adhered to by all the States of the region  nor by one of the extra-continental Powers which has territories under its administration within the area of the Treaty. Furthermore  recent events indicate that for the Treaty to become a truly effective instrument to guarantee the security of the Latin American nations  an efficient verification system to monitor the introduction of nuclear arms is required.Despite these limitations  Brazil has repeatedly affirmed its unwavering policy of abiding strictly by the terms of the Treaty of Tlatelolco  eschewing any activity involving the acquisition of nuclear arms.That policy  followed continuously and without vacillation  has had the broad support of the Brazilian people. The complete military denuclearization of Latin America is among the priority goals of the foreign policy of my Government  which is firmly committed  as are the Governments of other countries of the region  to avoiding the development and introduction of nuclear arms on the continent.The nuclear arms race is not merely a threat to our future; it arouses terror and has already killed  causing death through insecurity  fear  poverty and hunger. In the words of the great Brazilian poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade:""By the thought alone that it is coming to killThe bomb will kill;The bomb is indigence unifying millions of indigences.""Despite numerous protests and numerous warnings  in numerous forums - ""The bomb attends all conferences and sits alongside all"" - we must ask whether mankind will overcome the threat to its own destruction. A comforting message of optimism may perhaps be found in the final verses of the same expressive poem by the poet Drummond:""The bomb  confused beast  allows manTime to save himself.The bomb will not destroy lifeMan (X dearly trust) will extinguish the bomb.""Let us be confident. In the polished words of Thomas Jefferson  we are  after all  moved by""the conscientious desire to direct the energies of our nations to themultiplication of the human race  and not to its destruction.""Three other subjects merit special consideration.First  I wish to reiterate the importance that the Brazilian democracy attributes to the rights of the human person - to the absolute and full  unimpeded exercise of those rights. Significant international instruments  such as the international Covenants on human rights and the United Nations Convention against torture  are being incorporated into the Brazilian legal order  adding new guarantees for the perfect protection of those fundamental rights in our country.Z cannot fail to refer also to a momentous theme  the subject of drugs  to express the deep concern with which Brazil regards it. In our view  the problem has three essential aspects: the prevention of the improper use of drugs  the suppression of illicit drug traffic and the rehabilitation of chronic users. The problem will not be definitively resolved if those three facets are not taken equally into account. We also consider international co-operation to be essential in combating drug abuse  provided  naturally  that the sovereign rights of nations are safeguarded. Brazil participated actively in the Special Inter-American Conference on Traffic in Narcotic Drugs  held in Rio de Janeiro in April of this year under the auspices of the Organization of American States. We shall likewise give our most dedicated co-operation in the work of the international conference on drugs to be held in Vienna in 1987.The third theme is terrorism. From this rostrum I wish to express our most vehement  energetic and indignant rejection at its proliferation. The international community cannot continue to tolerate the practice of acts of terrorism and must unite without delay to eradicate their causes and eliminate their effects.I repeat  with emphasis  what I affirmed at the beginning of my address: strengthening the United Nations is the best way to guarantee international peace and security   In keeping with this view  my country has actively contributed to stimulating the implementation of measures to revitalize the United Nations. In the opinion of the Brazilian Government  the recommendations of the so-called Group of 18 are a first and promising step in that direction.We support an increasingly active role for the Secretary-General in the search for solutions to controversies. We support the Organization's examining all disputes and conflicts. We advocate flexibility in working methods  particularly in the Security Council  so that the major issues relating to peace and security can be treated substantively and constructively. We believe that it is necessary to counteract the tendency to bypass this forum in dealing with fundamental problems of peace which are of interest to the entire international community. These problems affect all and to all falls the responsibility for their solution.It was precisely on the basis of this conception of the United Nations that on 29 May I proposed  through the Secretary-General  on behalf of the Brazilian Government  the inclusion of the item ""Zone of peace and co-operation of the south Atlantic"" in the agenda for this session. This initiative results from the statement of President Jose Sarney before this General Assembly in September of 1985  when he said:""Brazil will make every effort within its power to ensure that the south Atlantic is preserved as an area of peace  shielded from the arms race  the presence of nuclear arms and any form of confrontation originating in other regions.""We are appreciative of the acknowledgment by the General Assembly *>f the pertinence of this item by including it in its current agenda. The initiative on the zone of peace and co-operation of the south Atlantic projects the need for an important collective effort  on behalf of which Brazil seeks to be merely a spokesman. What is involved is the guaranteeing of peace  security and development in a vast area of the globe  comprising countries of two continents united in their common determination to overcome obstacles standing in the way of the attainment of the progress and well-being of their peoples.On the one hand  the objective is to avert the serious threats to regional an<d( world security whether represented by the situation in southern Africa or by the transfer to the south Atlantic of East-West tensions and confrontations  accompanied by the geographic proliferation of nuclear arms and the resulting intensification of the nuclear arms race. On the other hand  there is the aim to promote broad possibilities of co-operation to benefit the economic and social development of the peoples of the region.The declaration of the south Atlantic as a zone of peace and co-operation would be a concrete measure in a vast program which the community of nations has itself defined as being of the highest priority in this forum: the conversion of irrational impulses towards confrontation into constructive work of international peaceful co-operation. It would constitute  moreover  the logical  complementary sequence of previous efforts of the Latin American and African countries  embodied in the Treaty of Tlatelolco  the Declaration on the denuclearization of Africa and the Lome Declaration and Program of Action relating to security  disarmament and development in Africa. Such a declaration would be a meaningful contribution to the promotion of universal peace based on equal rights and justice for all  which are supreme objectives of the United Nations.Brazilian foreign policy is not based on illusions  nor does it engage in rhetorical effusions. On the contrary  it translates permanent and legitimate concepts  aspirations and interests. We are a new country but not an immature country. We are a country with its own identity  which we value and respect  as we respect and value the identities of other nations. Our statements are clear  frank and direct expressions of the deeply rooted values of Brazilian society. When we speak of peace we do not consider that we are talking for the sake of talking. We do not hesitate to be insistent  even repetitious. I shall therefore allow myself to reaffirm here words spoken in this very forum by an illustrious predecessor of mine in the post of Foreign Minister  Joao Augusto de Araujo Castro:""We live within a system made up of reciprocal causes and effects. Just as peace is indivisible - because peace involves an element of independence and its consolidation requires the co-operation of sovereign unities - so the economic and social development of mankind  which is the condition and expression of peace  should be indivisible.""From this rostrum  at the last regular session of the General Assembly  President Sarney said:""The instrument that worked our transition from authoritarianism to democracy was our capacity to reconcile and understand  without violence or traumas."" (A/40/PV.4  p. 4-5)»To explain that peaceful transition  certain authors who are not Brazilian assert that Brazilians are a ""cordial"" people  averse to violent solutions as though by historical predestination. This is an inaccurate over-simplification the merits of which I do not wish to discuss.It is true that we are naturally inclined towards conciliation  based on tolerance and a staunch respect for differences. But if in moments of crisis there arises amongst us a favorable consensus towards understanding and negotiation  it is simply because we are keenly aware that the paths of violence  in addition to being ethically condemnable  are irrational and of short duration.It is sad for the human species that at times it is ""more difficult to make peace than to make war""  as Clemenceau said. This is the challenge which both sustains and stimulates the arduous work of the United Nations. In the course of its 41 years of existence  this Organization has striven  despite all obstacles  to carry out the essential task of building and preserving world peace  promoting dialog  understanding and harmony among peoples.On behalf of the Brazilian people and Government  I reiterate my country's commitment to this noble cause from which we cannot turn away."
"20",995,"BRB",41,1986,"I should in ray first words  Sir  express pleasure at your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. May I therefore  on behalf of the Government and the people of Barbados  extend our warmest congratulations on the fitting honor conferred upon you.Our countries  Bangladesh and Barbados  have much in common: a fraternity in the Commonwealth and our aspirations as new and developing States. Bangladesh's firm resolve in the face of great odds is a sterling example of sovereign integrity.I should also like to express my pleasure at the return to office of the Secretary-General  whose restoration to health and his customary vigor is most welcome.It is also fitting for me now to pay tribute to your distinguished predecessor  Ambassador Don Jaime de Pinies of the Kingdom of Spain  for the high level of proficiency with which he managed the deliberations of the momentous fortieth session  from which many noteworthy decisions emerged.Peace remains the cornerstone of the foreign policy of Barbados: peace in the Caribbean  peace in this hemisphere  peace in the world. Two decades ago the first - and now again - Prime Minister of the newly sovereign State of Barbados  the Right honorable Errol Barrow  standing at this rostrum proclaimed to all the foreign policy of our country in words which I feel compelled to repeat:""We are exponents of the diplomacy of peace aid prosperity. We will be friends of all   satellites of none.""The Government and the people of Barbados remain unimpressed by the enticements of hegemony  un-seduced by the bias of ideology end undaunted by any coercion from any quarter.Barbadians have learned from their history as an island community that there is a special challenge which nature presents to those on small islands.Prom our island outpost in the waters of the Caribbean we see much that is at enmity with peace - famine and poverty  disease  injustice  oppression and terror. These war with peace because they are the enemies of growth and development.The most imminent menace to peace in our times is the arsenal of destruction which is deployed over the globe. We watch bemused as the ritual of destruction is rendered before us in th?  litany of acronyms that are both cryptic and cruel: SAM  MIRV  SDI and  quite fittingly  MAD.Indeed we watch as what is now so glibly called an arms race is destroying all around us the norms essential for international fraternity. We watch as mortal danger and fear settle over the heads of the less powerful and the weak. And we watch as the earth's atmosphere  mysterious and good  is steadily and systematically despoiled. So the signs around us are ominous.But I do not believe that our doom is inevitable. What I do believe is that the noble experiment which this Organization reflects was not attempted in' vain. The members of this body need to ponder in earnest the ideals of its Charter and do what is necessary to free the world from the menace that draws near. This is the responsibility which should be assumed by those States which sat in San Francisco and declared their commitment to a new order in the world.In the field of regional co-operation the States of Europe  with their history of bloodshed  have led the way with initiatives in this particular endeavorr. The steady growth of European regionalism must suggest to the world that enmity need not be perpetual and that swords may indeed be beaten into ploughshares.We salute too the efforts  painful though they be  which African States have made towards the unity of their continent  and I am confident that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) will ride over all those obstacles which such effortsencounter and become in time the strong voice of Pan-African integrity and pride.Equal praise is due to the members of the Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN)  whose initiatives have already produced some easing of tensions in a region from which conflict has seldom been absent.We also welcome the timely movement in the Pacific States to place firmer bonds around their common interests.In this hemisphere  Barbados  by virtue of its association with the Organization of American States (OAS)  has acquired an enlarged perspective of our regional potential as neighbors once thought distant have become the staunchest of allies.Of particular significance  however  is the regional integration achieved by Caribbean States over the last decade. The Caribbean Community  or CARICOM  had its beginnings in the Treaty of Chaguaramas  which was signed in 1973. It now comprises 13 States  from the Bahamas in the north and from Belize in the north-west to Guyana in the south. In a dozen years of maturity the people of the Caribbean have grown increasingly assured that their development will come not from the over-zealous exercise of nationalism but from the patient and contiguous pursuit of inter-territorial co-operation.I have made references to regionalism to suggest that the solution to what we now regard as the modern problems of man may well have its source in regional movements. Regionalism  we believe  can be a potential counterweight to the politics of superiority which holds that weak States should be silent and should be manipulated at will. It can engender renewed interdependence among States and beat back the retreat from multilateralism which we are witnessing these days.The context in which the people of Barbados address the question of human rights is empirical and not theoretical. We have no authority in our country except that which is lawfully constituted. Those who administer the legal systemare not the same persons as those who make the laws.No citizen can be punished or deprived of his freedom except he transgressed a known law  and because of this there are no prisoners of conscience in our country  there is no detention withouttrial and no exemption from the rule of law.Constitutional authority in our country is exercised only by those upon whom it is lawfully conferred in free elections in which citizens  either individually or in political associations  choose their Governments. Opposition to government is not only possible in the ordinary sense but is safeguarded in the Constitution  which recognizes the right of a citizen to be believe what he wishes and to assemble with other citizens to criticize and oppose Governments so long as this isdone within the bounds of law and common decency.Other freedoms are institutionalized - freedom to hold  possess and bequeath private property  to worship one God or none at all  and to organize. Now I cannot say that this system is superior to all others. I merely assert that it is inferior to none.When  therefore  my delegation raises its voice in this Assembly to promote or defend human rights  it is not because we wish to interfere with other people's privacy or to dictate how they should live  but because we are persuaded that such a dispensation is the firmest foundation for the preservation of peace. My delegation therefore regards the rapid extension of human rights to all peoples not now enjoying them as an activity to which the whole wide world must rapidly turn. The regime in Pretoria - contemptuous  arrogant - has systematically deprived South Africa's majority of the means they require to achieve human dignity. The outrage felt by Barbados at this has already been voiced throughout the corridors of this Organization.The real danger in this situation is that those States that fumble aid hesitate in their policies towards Pretoria may themselves - I believe quite unconsciously - have been smitten by a mild attack of racism. I say unconsciously because anxiety to achieve a good end is often tainted by traces of self-righteousness. So those that resist the application of full sanctions against Pretoria express their concern that black babies will starve. I do not sneer at that sentiment  because what they fear is quite possible. It is therefore necessary for me to address this issue with some seriousness.In the first place  if the situation is such that the application of harsh measures against Pretoria can harm only blacks and not whites  and if this is a reason for hesitating to apply pressure  then apartheid is being endorsed as an unconquerable system  and unwillingness to tackle it is yet another concession to the theory and practice of white supremacy. Therefore  the reason given is blatantly racist.Secondly  if it is true that a determined assault upon that regime will be particularly detrimental to the interests of the blades  should not the nature and scope of the assault be so planned that the regime and its closest supporters share some of the perils facing the blades?I should like to imagine an entirely different scenario. Suppose there were in that country a situation in which 4 million blacks ruled 24 million whites in the same way as in the reverse situation we see today  would we hear that sanctions would hurt white babies? Would there be a policy of constructive engagement with the black minority regime? I wonder - I dare hardly suggest it  but I wonder -would there not be world-wide pressure to destroy such a black regime by incessant disruptions of the black—controlled economy  by a trade embargo  by sabotage and by concentrated and concerted intelligence activity? And - here is the litmus test -would such a regime be allowed to imprison the white nationalist leader for 25 years on the unproved ground that he was a Communist? That is not all. If the black regime promised to reform apartheid and to share power with the whites  would there not be a contemptuous roar of disgust and scorn from some States represented in this Assembly?I really do not need to apologize for any feeling of discomfort I might have stirred  for the scenario I have just depicted would not  simply because the colors are reversed  change this delegation's attitude to racism. Racism in any form  practiced by anyone  is odious and detestable.More than 100 new States have come into being since 1945. Nearly all of them are inhabited by dark-skinned humans  simply because the white populations of the globe had  for various historical reasons  not only organized themselves into sovereign States in previous centuries but in most cases included within the confines of their States territories and peoples from other continents. Thus  it was left to the twentieth century to witness the upsurge of nationalism and the channeling of that nationalism into the creation of new States across the continents.However  the regime in Pretoria is not part of that historical phenomenon. It is  rather  a mutation of the historical process  for it is the successful effort by a white minority  whose right to live in South Africa cannot be questioned  to have escaped British colonialism while fully inheriting its legacy. The regime is therefore an international outlaw.A South African black cannot vote. He cannot decide where he will live. He cannot choose where he will work. He cannot dive into a swimming pool before he looks at a sign  He exercises no choice in the education of his children. He cannot move from one place to another without a pass book. It is this odious system that blacks can no longer endure in their own country. To destroy it  they are willing to surrender their lives  for even if dying is their only passport to freedom  they intend to be free. My delegation pays a tribute to the courage of those States which have chosen not to hide behind the sufferings of the African majority. We also pay a tribute to the Congress of the United States  which only yesterday  in recollection of its own country's early revolutionary traditions  rescued the honor of the American people from the fetid embrace of the racist regime. Likewise  my delegation pays a tribute to the steadfastness of the front-line States. The peoples of Botswana  Zimbabwe  Swaziland  Lesotho  Zambia  Tanzania  Angola and Mozambique must be regarded as full allies in this struggle. Those States must be strengthened by the provision of markets for their goods and by the establishment of such machinery as would strengthen their economic and strategic interests.Nowhere is South Africa's contempt more noticeable than in its treatment of the people of Namibia. It is now nearly 70 years since the League of Nations entrusted to the Union of South Africa responsibility for preparing Namibia for political independence. But  not content with its subjugation of black South Africans  the architects of apartheid have stealthily embarked on the annexation of Namibia. In blatant betrayal of international trust  they have openly defied the efforts of the United Nations to rescue Namibia and t- y claim with audacity that the issue of Namibia is now an internal matter for the Government of South Africa.The Government of Barbados has declared its support for the efforts being undertaken by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and it calls on the international community to pressure South Africa into ending this disgraceful hijacking of the Namibian people.The principal ingredient of peace in the Middle East is the courage to accept two realities which contentious rhetoric cannot conceal. One such reality is that Israel exists. As such  it has the right to live and to live with others in peaceful security in a world of peoples. But the Palestinian people present us with our second reality. They too exist  and they too have an undoubted right to their own home  and they too ate entitled to exercise their legitimate rights in that national territory.My delegation believes that  in an atmosphere of good will and moderation  the edifice of peace in the Middle Bast can be completed. There is an understanding that the destruction of either party is not a prerequisite to peace  and there are signs  now emerging  which appear to indicate a willingness on the part of both sides to talk with each other  if a formula can be found for adjusting the problems of representation. This is a time for boldness and all the delegations to this forty-first session of the General Assembly should press forward towards it. I pledge the support of my delegation to this end.My delegation also condemns the deterioration in international conduct and wishes to see terrorism halted in the shortest possible time. We are persuaded that no political objective is worthy of support if  in furtherance of it  it becomes necessary to put innocent lives at risk. Such actions  whether resorted to by States  organizations or individuals  are crimes and  as such  are punishable under the laws of most countries.In a year of peace  such as this one is proclaimed to be  it cannot be irrelevant for the international community to a-i>eal for restraint and moderation in all political disputes so that differences may  wherever possible  be reconciled by discussion and consensus in preference to the use of violence as a means of solving political disputes.My delegation believes that durable solutions to the problems of the world economy can be found only through a partnership between developed and developing States.Unless developing countries are able to sell their goods and products at remunerative prices  they will be hard pressed to pay their international debts; and no amount of rescheduling of debts  no amount of new lending to consolidate all debts and no amount of the reduction of interest rates will address the fundamental causes of the debt crisis facing them. Such measures have their place  but only in the short term to relieve pressure on developing states.My Government therefore believes that the long-term solution to the debt crisis depends on the reactivation of a vibrant international trading system. In this connection we are pleased at the recent decision  reached in Punta del Este  on the start of the new round of global trade negotiations. It is our hope that the new round will be able to agree on concrete measures to bring about the standstill and roll-back of protectionist measures and will address all outstanding aspects of the international trading system.The report of the Group of High-level Inter-Governmental Experts  which reviewed the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations  has generated a level of attention and concern unprecedented in recent times. And with good reason. Because what is at stake is the very existence of this Organization and the way in which it functions. So amid all of the deliberation  consultation and negotiation  two things seemed to be accepted by all of us: first  that it is important for all of us to settle this matter quickly and quietly; secondly  that whatever happens  the United Nations will never be the same again.My delegation believes that the report represents an excellent foundation on which to develop a series of reforms with a view to cutting the fat  tightening the belt  firming the muscle and generally improving the health of the Organization. Beyond that  a package of reform  based on that foundation  might even lead to animproved process of decision-making that would satisfy the interests of all Member States  complying with the concept of universality and generally uphold theprinciples embodied in the Charter.It is unnecessary to say that any serious attempt at improving the operation of the united Nations should concentrate only on the working of the Secretariat. Member States must be prepared to accept some of the blame or credit  as the case may be  for the present situation. Non-payments  late payments and withholdings can in no way be attributed to the Secretariat. The political and other pressures that influence the selection of staff could hardly be countermanded by the Secretary-General who is himself appointed by Member States. The lack of co-ordination in the system could hardly have been achieved without the concurrence of Member States which are by and large represented in all the specialized agencies. Let us not tackle the mote before we have dealt with the beam.The situation in Central America is cause for disquiet in our region. Barbados wishes once again to record its support for the Contadora process and the work of the Lima Support Group. We call on all parties to dismantle all obstacles to the peacefully negotiated settlement of outstanding disputes.We observe with satisfaction the extension of the democratic process within the region and we trust that its continuance will lead to the consolidation of genuine good-neighborliness and hemispheric solidarity.Our concern extends as well to other troubled areas of the world: to Afghanistan and the violence being done to its ancient civilization; to Kampuchea  where innocent civilians daily pay the price for an ideological conflict; to the Koreas  where the demonstrated desire for reconciliation and unity is being frustrated by a boundary; to the Persian Gulf  where a fratricidal war has taken a toll which defies calculation. We trust that good reason will eventually prevail in the efforts now under way to end tensions in all of these areas. And we are calling for direct negotiations between the relevant parties  since we are convinced that those directly involved are best equipped to find the solutions to their specific problems.The manufacture and consumption of illegal drugs have now reached the proportions of an international crisis. Under lethal attack are the lives of hundreds of millions of young people and the civil order of every known society.Small island societies  like ours in the Caribbean  are particularly vulnerable to this fast-spreading menace since we are dependent upon a successful tourist industry and are ill-equipped to counter the sophisticated methods now being used by traffickers who ply this nefarious trade.The Government of Barbados thoroughly condemns this sinister enterprise and pledges its full support to the United Nations efforts to arrest the flow of illegal drugs. Barbados is also willing to co-operate with all States in the exchange of information and the institution of such measures aimed at the mutual protection of our societies. This annual general debate is in my view most important  for it provides a splendid opportunity for those who desire  as strict guardians of the Charter of the united Nations  to give an account of their stewardship and to become firm craftsmen of world peace.I have shared with this Assembly some of the experiences Barbados has had in its practice of government and some of its perspectives in its survey of existing world problems. Our presence here also offers us an opportunity to deepen our faith in the Charter of this body? to meet with colleagues and explore avenues for productive co-operation among our several countries.In 1987 Barbadians celebrate the twenty-first anniversary of their political independence. In 1987 we also celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the social revolution that initiated our orientation to nationhood. In 1988 we observe the 150th anniversary of the final phase of the ending of slavery in the British Empire. In 1989 we shall rejoice in the 350th anniversary of the founding of our Parliament  which except for periodic elections has met continually since 1639. These events we regard as important milestones on our way to national development; and my delegation pledges to the Assembly that our country will continue to welcome to our shores all those for whom human dignity  tranquility and order are the outstanding characteristics of our human family."
"21",1027,"BRN",41,1986,"Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of Brunei Darussalam  I offer you my sincere congratulations en your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your election to this high office reflects the respect and the esteem that the international community has for you personally and for your country  Bangladesh  with which Brunei Darussalam has always enjoyed warm and brotherly relations. I am confident that with the wealth of your experience and the wisdom of your views to guide it  this session of the General Assembly will be able to achieve its objectives.I also wish to offer ray profound appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies of Spain  who successfully presided over the proceedings and affairs of the historic fortieth session last year. I would also like to take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Perez de Cuellar  who has put so much effort into ensuring the effective and smooth running of this Organization.Almost a year has gone by since we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the birth of the United Nations. At that momentous gathering here last year  many world leaders spoke  expressing varying appreciations and perceptions of performance and effectiveness of the United Nations. Whilst some expressed satisfaction at the achievements and successes  others spoke of the failures and of the inability of the United Nations to act decisively. They also spoke of the weaknesses of the United Nations. But on the whole they came to the same conclusion  which we share  that the United Nations is necessary for achieving the ultimate goal of world peace and stability  and the United Nations can do much more than it has done to date towards achieving this cherished goal. However  the United Nations at this moment is facing a serious challenge to its very existence. Brunei Darussalam earnestly hopes that the problem can be quickly resolved.We are meeting again at this annual session of the General Assembly in order to consider together the problems of our time. We are meeting because we all feel that we have a responsibility and an obligation to our countries and to the human race to exert our influence to make the world a safer and better place for ourselves and for successive generations to live in. We have an equal responsibility to make our contribution to the achievement of the lofty purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. We cannot hope to achieve world peace and stability unless and until we are able to accept and translate into action this responsibility that we share  why is it so difficult to achieve this objective? It may be  as one leader said last year  that we have ceased to listen to one another.Every year we make our statements in this splendid Hall  each of us saying and declaring that we want a better world  a just world in which people can live in peace and harmony. Brunei Darussalam urges Member States to renew their belief in the principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and their commitment to them.At this forty-first session we are faced once again with the same unresolved issues. There are regional problems still waiting to be resolved. Cases of colonial and foreign domination still exist and need to be rectified. The arms race and the growth of nuclear arsenals continue to cast u dark shadow over the very future of mankind. There is an ever-widening gap between the poor and the rich. There is hunger and poverty. There is misery and deprivationsWorld peace will remain elusive as long as the nations of the world continue to ignore the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes. As long as the powerful nations continue to use force with impunity and to impose their will on smaller nations  the future of small nations cannot be made secure and their territorial sovereignty and integrity cannot be guaranteed.Brunei Darussalam believes that it is crucial to world peace that the security and sovereignty of small nations should be guaranteed. Their right to exist as independent and sovereign nations must be respected and ensured in an international environment of peace  stability and progress.Of late* much of our attention has been focused on the events in South Africa. This problem has been with us for a very long time. It is regrettable that it is still on the agenda of the United Nations. We have all condemned the system of apartheid  it is an evil system. It is degrading to the dignity of mankind. We have supported past efforts to bring about fundamental changes in South Africa and the dismantling of the apartheid system. Brunei Darussalam joins other like-minded nations in expressing its conviction that there is an urgent need to bring world-wide pressure to bear on South Africa through the application of comprehensive mandatory sanctions in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  since there is no other way.The situation in neighboring Namibia is by no means less disturbing. The racist Pretoria regime continues to impose its will on Namibia. Brunei Darussalam deeply regrets the continued refusal of the Pretoria regime to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978) as it has promised to do. Brunei Darussalam believes that the only way to solve the problem is for the international community to continue to increase pressure against the Pretoria regime.In the Middle East  the situation remains serious. The resolution of the Palestinian issue is still not in sight. The Palestinian people continue to be deprived of a homeland of their own. We have said many times before that the situation will continue to deteriorate unless Israel withdraws its forces from the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967. Peace continues to elude Lebanon. The war between Iran and Iraq also continues unabated.In Afghanistan  although there is a glimmer of hope  the situation is not very much improved from what it was a year ago. Brunei Darussalam  however  welcomes the recent development  although it is a slight one  and hopes that early settlement of the problems can be achieved. We applaud the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative  Mr. Cordovez  for their untiring efforts in the search for a peaceful settlement of the problem consistent with the principles upheld by the United Nations. We also commend the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for its patience and its contributions. As a neighbor of Afghanistan's  Pakistan has to shoulder the very heavy burden of looking after several hundred thousand Afghan refugees.We have bee.2 saddened  however  to learn that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Pakistan have been violated many times  with resulting damage to property and loss of human lives. These violations are contrary to the rules of international law and a gross violation of the Charter of the United Nations. Brunei Darussalam joins other nations in condemning these acts of unprovoked aggression.In South-East Asia  the situation in Kampuchea has not changed. Kampuchea continues to be intransigent. Hundreds of thousands of Kampucheans are still encamped along the Thai-Kampuchean border. Not only does this impose hardships and difficulties on Thailand but it has become a burden to this Organization and to the international community.As a member of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  Brunei Darussalam wishes to see a peaceful political settlement of this problem  we wish to see the withdrawal of all foreign forces so that sovereignty and territorial integrity can be restored to the Kampuchean people. We wish to see a process of national reconciliation and the restoration of unity and freedom to the people ofKampuchea. He wish to see the return of peace so that the people of Kampuchea may be allowed to determine their common future and destiny free from all external interference or pressure.Brunei Darussalam supports the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea under the wise and able leader ship of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea has wide international support. Recently that Government put forward an eight-point proposal for a solution to the Kampuchean problem. We see this as a reasonable and constructive proposal inasmuch as it addresses the core issues of the problem*  phased withdrawal of all foreign troops  national reconciliation and self-determination. It offers a constructive framework for negotiation. The Kampuchean problem can be resolved only by peaceful negotiations in which all the Kampuchean people are represented. A peaceful Kampuchea would lead to a peaceful South-East Asia  and this could benefit all the countries of the region  including Viet Nam.With regard to the Korean Peninsula  we wish to state that Brunei Darussalam continues to welcome any development that would lead to the lessening of tension in the region. We urge the two countries concerned to resume the suspended dialog. We feel that the Korean question should be resolved peacefully through dialog and negotiations between the South and the North. We also wish to reiterate our support for the admission of the Republic of Korea to membership of the United Nations and indeed urge the admission of both Koreas  consistent with the principle of universality.The world today is faced not only with political problems but also with a severe economic crisis. The economies of many developing countries suffer from massive unemployment  depressed commodity prices and a heavy burden of debt repayment. The protectionist policies adopted by many developed countries have prevented goods from third-world countries from gaining access to their markets.The resulting dislocation of the economies of the third world can only bring about political instability. This in turn will inevitably bring economic chaos to an already fragile world economy. Brunei Darussalam joins other third-world nations in urging the developed countries to be more open-minded. We urge them to be more receptive to proposals put forward by the third world. They must be more sensitive to this issue. They must be made to understand that their protectionist policy is seriously undermining our political stability.While conscious of the worldwide tensions caused by armed disputes  we are also aware of the increasing threat and danger of drug abuse. Drug abuse and illicit trafficking in drugs have reached an alarming stage. The implications for socio-economic security and for the cultural aspects of human life are evident. Brunei Darussalam recognizes that this social epidemic can be eradicated only through concerted national  regional and international efforts. We have taken appropriate steps in Brunei Darussalam by establishing an anti-drugs unit to co-ordinal such drug-related programs and activities as the enforcement of narcotic laws  the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts and the implementation of drug-prevention programs. At the regional level  Brunei Darussalam has worked closely with its ASEAN partners. We welcome the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  which will be convened in June next year and hope that that Conference can suggest positive steps to combat this social disease.In conclusion  I wish once again to assure you  Mr. President  of Brunei Darussalam's full and unstinting support to you and to the United Nations."
"22",1070,"BTN",41,1986,"Sir  I have the honor to convey the warm greetings and good wishes of His Majes y Jigme Singye Wang chuck  King of Bhutan  to you and all the representatives for the success of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.May I also extend the warmest felicitations of my delegation to you  Sir  on your election as the President of this session of the General Assembly. Given your outstanding credentials  including long diplomatic service in various parts of the world and in the United Nations itself  there could have been no better choice for this high office. The close and friendly relations Bhutan has always maintained with your country  Bangladesh  is an additional reason that we are delighted to see you preside over the General Assembly.I wish to. place on record our sincere appreciation to Mr. Jaime de Pinies for the manner in which he guided the historic fortieth anniversary session. His fine stewardship of the General Assembly earned for him  and for his country  Spain  the respect of the international community.Our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  deserves our highest commendation for his inspired leadership  and for his zeal and dedication in upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. My delegation should also like to express its admiration for his incisive annual reports.The fortieth anniversary session held last year was a milestone in the history of the United Nations. A gathering of world leaders eloquently reaffirmed theircommitment to the Charter and testified to the vital importance of a multilateral approach to the world's problems. Constructive action was taken on such issues as terror ism  a par the id  and drug abuse. And there was much genuine cause for celebration - the world Organization  which after all is still very young  had weathered many crises in its history  had a long list of triumphs to its credit  and was again acknowledged as man's best hope for world peace and security.The glow from that historic session still remains  but in this International Year of Peace  we cannot afford to be complacent  for we are confronted with grave dangers on several fronts.The crisis in South Africa threatens to explode in a major cataclysm in which all of southern Africa could be plunged in a vast conflagration. The urgency of this situation was forcefully highlighted in the Harare Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement recently. The source of the problem  as all the world knows  is apartheid and the utterly intransigent position of the racist regime in refusing to negotiate with black leaders or accept United Nations mandates. The daily atrocities perpetrated in the name of this latest so-called state of emergency  by which the Pretoria regime shows its complete contempt for international public opinion  boggle the imagination: the arrest  torture  and intimidation of thousands of opponents of apartheid  mass deportations  tight censorship of the new.. Little children are being brutally murdered every day.We denounce in the strongest possible terms South Africa's continued illegal occupation of Namibia. The rights of the people are trampled  their aspirations denied  their natural resources plundered  their leaders imprisoned  their young men conscripted into the South African military. We condemn the ""Multi-Party Conference"" and other fraudulent schemes for the continued domination of the Territory. Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  containing the United Nations plan  remains the only acceptable basis for the independence of Namibia. We reaffirm our full support for the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) as the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people.We call for comprehensive mandatory sanctions against south Africa. We deplore the economic blackmail practiced by South Africa against the front-line States  and call for financial assistance to these States which are now courageously attempting to free themselves from economic dependence on South Africa.The situation in the Middle East continues to demand our urgent attention. The plight of the Palestinians remains the crux of the problem. The Palestinians must be granted the right to self-determination  including the right to national self-determination in their homeland.We call upon Israel to comply with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations by withdrawing totally and unconditionally from all areas occupied since 1967. Only then will a just solution to the Middle East conflicts be possible. We support the security and right to exist in safety of all States in the area  including Israel.Iran and Iraq remain deadlocked in a bitter war. Neither side has gained any advantage  both have suffered appalling losses in terms of countless human lives and destruction of property. The end result has been untold misery and death. One corollary to all this is that meaningful economic development on both sides has been virtually halted  so that the disastrous effects of this war will be felt not only by the present but also by future generations. We earnestly urge an immediate cease-fire  and call upon both sides to settle their differences by peaceful means.We support the rights of the peoples of Kampuchea and Afghanistan to determine their own destiny free from foreign interference  subversion and coercion. We call for political settlements in these two countries based on the withdrawal of foreign troops and restoration of their independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status.The Korean question must be resolved by peaceful means through direct dialog and negotiation between south and North Korea. The deeply-rooted mutual suspicion and hostility must be replaced with mutual understanding  trust and national reconciliation in order to establish the proper conditions for a peaceful unification of the country.In this regard  we support the admission of both South and North Korea into the United Nations  as this will increase the opportunities for dialog and co-operation between them  and enhance the prospects of establishing a durable peace on the peninsula.Our greatest challenge remains the nuclear arms race. This has created a climate of fear and instability. Indeed  while the possibility of total annihilation hangs over all  there can be no real security for anyone. The concept of Star Wars  once confined to the realm of science fiction  now threatens to become a grim reality  with the arms race being extended to outer space. Far from strengthening international peace and security  the ever-escalating arms race only serves to aggravate existing tensions.The lack of progress in the area of arms control is cause for serious concern. We urge the super-Powers to dedicate themselves to a constructive dialog; the momentum for this must be vigorously revived. While we are fully aware that the practical details of the bargaining require much arduous work  the ultimate goal must always be kept in mind - the goal of disarmament.Nothing less than total disarmament can be acceptable to the international community  and as a first step we join in calling for a complete halt to the testing of new nuclear weapons systems  and a freeze in the production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. We also call for a halt to the production and proliferation of conventional weapons and a ban on the testing  production  and proliferation of chemical weapons.One example of an area still desperately in need of assistance is that of sub-Saharan Africa. The crisis there is far from over. Though increased rainfall has alleviated the drought somewhat  mass starvation and disease still threaten millions of lives. Even beyond the immediate crisis  however  the long-term rehabilitation needs of the region must be met. We hope that the program of action emanating from the special session on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa convened last spring will receive the generous financial support of the international community.The problems of sub-Saharan Africa  which stem in part from colonial legacies and in part from natural disasters  present a striking example of the fundamental injustice of current international economic relations. It is clear that a more equitable world economic infrastructure would have in large measure cushioned the region from such shocks. Trade restrictions  deteriorating commodity prices  reduced and restricted capital flows  and high interest rates  combine to hurt the economies of the developing countries. Indeed  it is often the developing countries  and especially the least developed among them  that suffer the most from fluctuations in the world economy  for they lack the means to adapt to changing conditions. The developed nations cannot flourish at the expense of the developing countries. This can only bring about further unrest  undermine social stability  and in the end adversely affect the developed countries as well. In our interdependent world  we have no choice but to co-operate  rich nations with poor  developed with developing.To end this overall global economic malaise  we urge the resumption of the North-South dialog  and the establishment of a new international economic order. The creative partnership implied would insure equitable economic relations  impart a new dynamism to the global economy  and bring about many social and humanitarian improvements.The various specialized agencies and affiliated bodies of the United Nations continue to play an impressive role in helping to bridge the widening gap betweendeveloped and developing nations. My own country  Bhutan  has benefited enormously from these agencies and bodies of the United Nations  which have worked closely with our Government for the socio-economic development of our country. The co-operation of these organizations has affected all aspects of our national life. In particular  I would like to express our deep gratitude to the united Nations Development program (UNDP)  United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)  united Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF)  the World Health Organization (WHD)  the World Food program (WFP)  the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  the united Nations Volunteers (UNV)  the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFEft)  and the united Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  for their invaluable assistance.Our goal is self-reliance  and the work of these organizations has helped to put us on the road to the achievement of this end. We believe that the primary responsibility for a nation's development resides with that nation itself.I would like to mention that progress on the implementation of the Substantial New program of Action for the least developed countries has been disappointing. The assistance provided is sadly inadequate to our needs. Bhutan is committed to taking national actions as called for in that Program. We have developed specific programs on the district level  initiated a process of decentralization of our development administration  involved our people directly through such organizations as the District Development Committees  instituted major fiscal reforms  and in general demonstrated an active willingness to do our part. Further  external assistance must be forthcoming  however  before we can hope to reach even the beginnings of economic self-reliance. Bhutan is an active supporter of the concept of regional co-operation in South Asia. While addressing the Harare summit of the Non-Aligned Movement recently. His Ma jest/ the Ring of Bhutan said:""A most positive development in our own region of South Asia has been the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation which was formally launched last December by a summit meeting in Dhaka. The summit manifested the determination of the seven South Asian leaders to work together towards finding solutions to common problems in a spirit of friendship  trust and co-operation. Our Association will promote the objectives of individual and collective self-reliance  and further the cause of peace  progress and stability in South Asia. The second summit will take place shortly and we look forward to building on the progress already made.""Bhutan is wholeheartedly committed to the Uhifced Nations in the belief that a multilateral approach to the world's problems is the most effective one. Such problems as pollution or nuclear weapons or global economic malaise can only be resolved by the collective will and action of the international community. As we are all aware  the United Nations is facing today the worst financial crisis in its history. The Secretary-General has taken some initiatives to meet the immediate problems. The Group of High Level Intergovernmental Experts  which was entrusted with the task of reviewing the administrative and financial matters in the United Nation  has come up with a sound report recommending some much-needed reforms. The report  in our view  deserves our most serious consideration."
"23",1110,"BWA",41,1986,"Botswana joins the chorus of congratulations that have been extended to Mr. Choudhury  upon his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. My delegation has no doubt that in him we have an able and experienced helmsman who will steer the deliberations of the session to a fruitful conclusion. In offering his services to our Organization  Bangladesh has demonstrated its unwavering support for the purposes and principles of the United Nations. He is joining the alumni of sons and daughters of third-world countries who have served and continue to serve our Organization with honor and distinction. He will have my delegation's unflinching support in the performance of his onerous task. His predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies of Spain  also deserves our commendation. His skillful stewardship of the historic celebrations that marked the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is recalled with enduring admiration and nostalgia.Our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  has continued to serve our Organization with great skill and dedication. How grateful my delegation is to see him looking much recovered from his recent indisposition and back at the helm  we salute him and the international staff that work under him. They have come from all corners of the globe to serve their fellow men  wherever they may be  to the best of their abilities. We recognize their sacrifice; we thank them for their dedication and devotion to their noble calling.The Secretary-General's report  which my delegation has read with great interest  will  as in the past  enhance and guide our work. With the candor that has become his trademark he has again highlighted a number of issues that need our Organization's urgent attention. At the top of those issues is the financial crisis that threatens to disrupt not only many activities of the Organization but even its very existence. The Secretariat itself has-already embarked upon several steps designed to curb waste and reduce costs as well as improve efficiency and effectiveness. Botswana will go along with any carefully designed corrective measures aimed at the optimum use of resources  whether they be financial  human or otherwise. We hope the work undertaken by the Group of 18 experts will assist our Organization finally to put its house in order.My delegation would like to appeal to those who have done so not to withhold their contributions at a time when the United Nations needs more  not less  financial resources. The great importance we attach to the survival of the Organization impels us to caution against the erroneous thinking popular in certain quarters that the Organization has too much money to spend or waste  the corollaryto that fallacy being that  if you deny it more money  then the problem will disappear. The fact is that the United Nations needs more money  not less  to finance the many humanitarian projects all of us expect it to carry out.The rest of our agenda is a full one  loaded as it is with familiar issues solutions to which are crucial to the survival of the world as we know it. I should now like to turn to some of these burning issues.This past May the General Assembly met in a special session in this Hall to consider the economic crisis facing the African continent. Participation in that session was  in itself  a moving experience for me  for it was the culmination of perhaps the longest sustained international relief effort ever recorded in recent memory  one aimed at saving hundreds of thousands of lives in sub-Saharan Africa caught in a long spell of drought and other natural calamities. The momentous decision to convene the special session taken by the fortieth session of the General Assembly  raised the hopes of the African people. We all hoped that  at long last  the world's conscience was awakening to the noble imperative of helping Africa to help itself. We saw the special session as an opportunity to mobilize additional resources which would enable us to implement the economic priority programs adopted by our Heads of Government at Addis Ababa in July 1985.In many respects  the special session was a success. The international community was for the first time sensitized to the magnitude and urgency of the problems facing the African continent. African leaders themselves had put on paper their own admissions of past mistakes and failed policies and made firm commitments to the implementation of the African Priority program for Economic Recovery (APPER)   if the world would respond positively to their call for medium- and long-term programs of assistance. My Government wishes to record its gratitude to those nations and organizations that took the opportunity provided by the special session to write off some of the official debts they were owed by a member of African countries and that also announced some new programs of co-operation or a revitalization of those already in existence.My delegation hopes that those donor nations that did not appear to be enthusiastic about APPER have since had time for serious reflection. We understand some of the misgivings advanced by those nations that did not agree with certain assumptions contained in APPER. Yes  in some respects the economic problems facing African countries are a function of many other deep-seated realities traceable to many sources  some of which are demonstrably exogenous.Developing countries  including African countries  have repeatedly complained in many forums about the protectionist policies of certain developed countries  the low commodity prices that are paid by developed countries for their products  the high interest rates and the crushing debt-service burdens and low levels of external concessional assistance  which make recovery very difficult and hinder efforts towards development. As a remedy  they have collectively called for the establishment of a new set of relationships which would usher in a new international economic order. If the sorry economic plight which still faces many African countries is to be addressed effectively  urgent action is required now  before it is too late. The momentum gained at the special session must not be allowed to peter out.Recognizing that no country on its own can tackle the multifaceted problems of development  we in southern Africa created a little more than six years ago  in the spirit of the Lagos Plan of Action  the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC)  of which many representatives already know. We wanted to develop our economies collectively and reduce our dependence on external sources generally and South Africa in particular. Within a short time  SADCC  which is composed of the nine independent countries of southern Africa - Angola  Botswana  Lesotho  Malawi  Mozambique  Swaziland  Tanzania  Zambia and Zimbabwe - has proved to be a serious tool of regional economic development  in spite of South Africa's evil machinations against it.Within SADCC we have adopted a program of action which gives high priority to the rehabilitation of transport systems. Since economic sanctions against South Africa have become inevitable and the threat of retaliation against us by the apartheid regime more menacing  we appeal to nations in a position to do so to assist us as a matter of urgency to achieve our objective of ensuring that the lifelines of SADCC - the Beira and Maputo corridors and the Tazara and Benguela railways - are rehabilitated and secured for our exports and imports.In addition  all our sectoral programs in agriculture  food security  energy  commerce and industry and many other areas need to be accelerated. We need additional resources urgently so that we can defend our independence and continue development with the momentum necessary to give our peoples a better life. Those with influence on South Africa must use that influence to dissuade it from destroying SADCC projects and destabilizing our countries.We are aware that prospects for the world economy are not very bright* According to World Bank projections  growth in the industrialized countries is likely to be around 3 per cent or less this year. That does not augur well for many developing countries whose economies are dependent on the generosity of the developed countries. Nevertheless  we hope that the Governments of developed countries will  in spite of sluggish growth in their own countries  shoulder their full responsibility to the less privileged of the world I have spoken at some length on economic issues because they affect millions of lives every day  every hour and every minute across the globe. In a real sense their final solution  or the lack of it  will determine to a large extent whether the next century will usher in prosperity and peace or be another century of conflict and misery. The world cannot afford to be indifferent to the poverty of so many in the midst of so much plenty. Something ought to be done  and done now  to confront and push back the boundaries of man's real enemies: hunger  disease  ignorance and poverty.There are several other pressing issues on our agenda. The questions of general and complete disarmament  nuclear weapons  decolonization  the intractable Palestinian issue  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  the festering sore that is apartheid. Western Sahara  the war between Iraq and Iran  the large population of refugees in the world  human rights  international terrorism  Korea  drug trafficking  the delayed independence of the international Trust Territory of Namibia: all these are issues that deeply concern us in Botswana. On the question of disarmament and nuclear weapons  I need only say that those that bear the primary responsibility for the continuing arms race must continuously take into account the concerns of the millions of people around the world who are fearful of the prospect of a nuclear holocaust. It is my delegation's fervent hope that the ongoing talks between the super-Powers will ultimately bear fruit. We also call upon those nations that have acquired nuclear technology to stay within the limits of agreed international safeguards and never to use it for the manufacture of more weapons of mass destruction  so that the billions of dollars now wasted on the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction may be well spent on the betterment of the human condition.At center stage in our deliberations are political problems whose intractability continues to threaten the peace and stability of our world. In my part of the world  the region of southern Africa  the political fuse has been lit  is hissing and could ignite a catastrophic conflagration at any time. The people of South Africa have reached the end of their tether and their endurance of the indignities and humiliations heaped upon them and their ancestors for over three centuries. They have taken to the streets of Soweto  Langa  Crossroads  Alexandra and Durban to demand the restoration of their birthright in their motherland.Sadly  the South African white minority rulers  the inventors of the evil ideology of apartheid  have chosen not to sit down at the negotiating table with their black compatriots to negotiate a new democratic and non-racial dispensation in South Africa. Instead they have responded in the same old brutal fashion  with mass killings  including the killing of young children  mass arrests of trade union leaders and anti-apartheid activists  endless declarations of states of emergency in African townships  murderous attacks on neighboring countries for crimes theyhave not committed  and the spawning of bandit movements to destabilize the front-line States. Thousands have already died at the hands of the regime's security forces in a vain attempt to defy the verdict of history. More are likely to die before South Africa can accept that apartheid is an indefensible and evil system whose eradication is long overdue.The world has already declared apartheid to be a crime against humanity  yet it has continued to offer the authors of the crime one olive branch after another. One such olive branch was the Commonwealth mission  composed of men and women of international standing and high repute. Their brief was ""good will to all and malice to none"" in the polyglot environment of South Africa. Many people in the world  including those who had misgivings about the prospects of the mission's success from the beginning  thought that South Africa would see the desperate need for peaceful change and seize the opportunity to show the world that it is capable of redeeming itself. That was not to be. The white minority regime  with incredible malice aforethought  scuttled the mission by attacking three Commonwealth neighbors while the Eminent Persons Group was in South Africa.At the end of their mission  the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group  in one of the most poignant of the concluding paragraphs of its report  stated:""Our mandate was to foster a process of negotiation across lines of color  politics and religion  with a view to establishing a non-racial and representative Government. It is our considered view that  despite appearances and statements to the contrary  the South African Government is not yet ready to negotiate such a future  except on its own terms. Those terms  in regard to both objectives and modalities  fall far short of reasonable black expectations and well-accepted democratic norms andprinciples. Thus  a mission in which so much of our hopes had been invested ended as though it had never begun  and the death-dance in the blood-soaker streets of blacktownships continued unabated.In desperation over this kind of intransigence  the international community now sees economic sanctions against South Africa as the last peaceful resort to push that country towards the dismantling of apartheid. Botswana cannot itself impose sanctions against South Africa  but will not stand in the way of those that can and decide to do so. Botswana is only too aware of the urgent need to resolve the intractable problem of apartheid. This is necessary if we are to avoid a bloodbath in our region. Those who can  especially the major trading partners of South Africa  but will not impose sanctions against that country must not use us as an excuse for their inaction.We remain convinced  nevertheless  that it is not too late for the leaders of South Africa  both black and white  to sit down together  in a spirit of reconciliation  at a conference table to negotiate a non-racial  democratic future for South Africa  which must of necessity be preceded by: first  the release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners*  secondly  the unbanning of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC)} thirdly  the lifting of the state of emergency and removal of troops from black townships; and  fourthly  the return of exiles.Namibia's dream deferred is no nearer realization this year than it was during the past year. South Africa remains defiant in its refusal to accept the resolution adopted by the United Nations calling upon it to co-operate in granting independence to the international Territory. It is determined to give all the appearance and substance of sovereignty to the puppet so-called interim government in Windhoek  and it will not be long before the international community is asked to give recognition and respectability to an internal settlement in Namibia.ty Government holds firm to the view that United Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only acceptable basis for Namibia's independence and we reaffirm our total rejection of the linking of Namibia's independence to the resolution of irrelevant issues. Linkage of Namibia's independence to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola is tantamount to holding hostage the destiny of the Namibian people to the solution of an issue irrelevant to it. The people of Namibia have inalienable rights that must be respected by those who govern them against their will. We therefore call for the implementation of .Security Council resolution 435 (1978) without delay.The people of Western Sahara have still not yet been allowed to exercise their right to self-determination  in spite of several promises by those who claim ownership of their territory. We call upon all the parties involved to find a formula which would allow the Sahraoui people the opportunity to exercise their right to self-determination. To that end we hope that advantage will be taken of the Secretary-General's continued good offices.In the Middle East peace is still as elusive as ever. The Palestinians are still entrapped in refugee camps  in an interminable and painful diaspora  waiting impatiently for the enjoyment of their right to self-determination in a country of their own. Israel is still in occupation of Arab lands and most of the Arab nations in turn still refuse to recognize the State of Israel and come to grips with the permanence of its existence in the Middle East. My Government's position on this vexing issue remains: an independent State for the Palestinian people*  withdrawal by Israel from Arab territories acquired by force; and recognition by the Arab nations of the State of Israel and its right to exist within secure and internationally recognized borders. Those are the requirements that must be fulfilled if a solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict is to be realized and lasting peace is to take root in the Middle East.In the Latin American region  we are increasingly fearful of the implications and possible consequences of the endless destabilization of Nicaragua by externally supported and financed dissident movements  popularly known as contras. We in Botswana do not see how the destabilization of Nicaragua or any other country inCentral America where turmoil has become endemic can be in the interest of those in this region who  curiously enough  seem to see a great deal of virtue in the murderous activities of the bandit contra revolutionaries. How can the security of one country  however powerful  be enhanced by the desperate insecurity of its neighbors?The Contadora process deserves our support  because it is a process dedicated to the search for peace. It should not be sabotaged.The question of the Falklands (Malvinas) remains unresolved because the parties to the dispute over the sovereignty of the islands are still talking to each other across a chasm of mutual suspicion and bitterness  instead of talking with each other across a negotiating table. We urge the two sides to put history behind them and get down to the urgent task of ensuring that another bloody confrontation in the South Atlantic can be avoided in favor of a peaceful settlement of the dispute.This body has on several occasions in the past called upon nations that have foreign troops in Afghanistan and Kampuchea to withdraw them at the earliest opportunity. It is regrettable that those calls have gone unheeded. My Government joins those who insist that Afghanistan and Kampichea must be left alone to mind their own business without foreign interference. Consequently  we reiterate our call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from those two countries.The war between Iran and Iraq has been going on for six years no*. The destruction that it has wreaked on lives and properties on both sides is incalculable  unconscionable and scandalous. Surely this is a war that the two sides could do without-  its termination is far too long overdue.The people of the Korean peninsula need not belong to two Koreas at this time. Botswana supports the peaceful reunification of the two parts  to beachieved through a direct and fraternal dialog between them.  without any interference from outside. In spite of the difficulties that we understand have resulted in the suspension of contacts between the two sides  it is our cherished hope that everything will be done to get back to the path of dialog.Refugees have become one of the most pressing problems of our age. Africa is one of the greatest concentration areas of those unfortunate people. Much as my country is grateful for the assistance that the international community has been giving and continues to give for the upkeep of refugees  we believe none the less that the ultimate cure lies in tackling the root cause of this scourge. Governments ought to adopt a more tolerant attitude towards those of their citizens who nay not agree with their policies on ideological  religious or other grounds. We are fully aware of the complex make-up of certain societies  but we are convinced that Governments themselves could do a great deal to curb this growing scourge if they respected their citizens' right to differ  treated their human rights with caring circumspection and tolerance  and adhered to the relevant United Nations conventions.Another serious menace in the world today is terrorism - terrorism  naked  brutal and evil. We condemn unreservedly and find inexcusable the terrorism of the indiscriminate killing  maiming or hostage-taking of innocent civilians by individuals or groups aimed at forcing Governments  organizations or individuals to acquiesce in their diabolic extortions by which they relegate human life to the worth of a mere tradable commodity.What is even more condemnable and utterly deplorable is the terrorism in which some States are engaged for reasons which are as indefensible and contemptible as those which are often advanced by hijackers and kidnappers. States which spawn terrorist bandits and unleash them on their neighbors or distant foes  or directly engage in terrorist activities against their neighbors are as terroristic as the bandits they spawn. They are guilty of State terrorism. The international community must take a resolute stand against such terrorism.A similar menace in the world is that of drug trafficking. If it is not checked now it will destroy our civilization  because it corrupts the morality of those who engage in it. The victims are mostly the youth whose mental and physical growth it ravages  and without healthy minds and bodies what kind of future can we contemplate in the hands of a hallucinated generation. My delegation is pleased that many Governments are now taking concerted action to fight this menace at the source. We must intensify our efforts to meet the drug-pushers head on. Peace and security are precious concomitants of human existence. They do not fall like manna from heaven; they are dynamic conditions that depend on conscious and tireless efforts to bring them about and ensure their permanence. The world has had to fight two tragic wars because of the folly of certain nations. At the end of the last war the United Nations was created in the hope of avoiding another war. But we often wonder if we have really learned a lessen from the tragedy of the Second World War.In its 40 years of existence the United Nations has had a good number of critics  but it also has its ardent supporters. It has had glaring shortcomings in a number of areas  but there is no denying that it is still the arbiter of peace. It is still our only hope for the future. Let us not repeat the follies of the past. Let us work tirelessly to preserve the United Nations."
"24",1155,"CAF",41,1986," On behalf of His Excellency President Andre Kolingba  Head of State and Government of the Republic  who wishes us every success in our work  I should like to extend to you  Sir  my delegation's sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-first regular session of the General Assembly of our Organization. Your election is a tribute rightly paid your country  Bangladesh  a member like my own of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  whose militant commitment to peace and international co-operation are well known. Your experience and mastery of international affairs make you more than qualified to conduct our discussions in this difficult period for the United Nations. I am sure of that  and I should like to assure you of my delegation's full co-operation.My delegation greatly valued the skill  wisdom and competence with which your predecessor  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  discharged the mission entrusted to him at the last session.Lastly  to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the United Nations Secretary-General  I should like once again to express the gratitude of the Central African Republic for his profound sense of responsibility and for his unflagging determination to see the cause of the United Nations triumph.That cause  for which we gather here in this Hall to present an image of a peaceful world  is a cause that we share. Its defense  despite all the problems of our era and the often pronounced opposition to our interests  is also something in which we share  and it calls for constant devotion and faith.Last year's celebration of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization provided us with an opportunity to evaluate its achievements. In particular  that anniversary provided the international community with the opportunity to restate its faith and reaffirm its commitment to the United Nations ideals of peace and security  democracy and tolerance  equality and justice.The general conclusion was that  in spite of the United Nations' limited achievements  its existence is necessary as an irreplaceable instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security  as well as co-operation in an increasingly complex but increasingly interdependent world.Thus in the final analysis it was recognized that the United Nations plays a preponderant role in the organization and implementation of multilateral co-operation.And yet  since last year the state of the world has not been that hoped for by those who attended the San Francisco Conference  for they imagined the world practicing tolerance  living in peace in a spirit of good-neighborliness  joining forces to maintain international peace and security  ensuring that armed force would not be used  and promoting the economic and social progress of all peoples.Instead of that world of peace and solidarity  we are living in a world marked by a spirit of domination  by expansionism and by the quest for or desire to preserve zones of influence which often give rise to conflicts and tension played out in the countries of the third world. The state of the world is not what the Charter envisaged because the basic and essential principal of the equality of peoples and their right to self-determination is not everywhere respected; I refer in particular to Africa  the Middle Bast and Asia. The state of the world is not as envisaged by the Charter because poverty  disease and illiteracy continue to be the lot of the majority of peoples.This state of the world  characterized by a marked recrudescence of selfish policies  one result of which is the serious crisis of the united Nations  demands of us a collective increase in political resolve directed to strengthening multilateralism as the best form of co-operation  capable of providing real solutions to all our problems.First and foremost we must have real co-operation for real peace in this International Year of Peace. The machinery envisaged by the Charter must be made to work*  above all  the principal body of the United Nations  the Security Council  must take action. The Security Council is the custodian of the common interest and bears the weighty responsibility of maintaining international peace and security  it must demonstrate good faith whenever peace is threatened or breached. The essential role of the permanent members - in particular the most powerful of them -requires the calm dialog necessary for the defense of that common interest. Consequently the weighted vote of the permanent members of the Security Council implies that they must not take an exclusive view of the world  far less engage in ideological confrontations which can only hinder the settlement of disputes.The fact that international peace and security are everyone's concern means that the Security Council must not become a mere recording studio where roles are. Played out  where debate follows debate  where vetoes proliferate and where decisions are on rare occasions adopted but are seldom implemented. In the view of the Central African Republic this is a deviation from  a dereliction of the heavy responsibilities of the Security Council  the primary depositary of our hopes for the advent of the world envisaged in the Charter. Thus in the general interests of international peace and security the full exercise by the Security Council of its mandatory powers  binding on all Members  is a fundamental condition for strengthening the authority of the United Nations and enhancing confidence in the Organization  we must also strive all together in good faith to ensure that the values enshrined in the Charter prevail  including the most basic value of freedom.Freedom is indivisible and universal. It cannot  at one time  mobilize all peoples without distinction when it is threatened in one continent*  on other continents  while at another time  the international community is divided  freedom is given conflicting interpretations or subjected to haphazard or self-interested approaches that impede its advent and its full realization.The right to self-determination and independence  the right of every people to regain or to fight to regain its homeland  the right of every people to be master of its own destiny cannot be honored and exercised in one place  while it is trampled on and stolen in another  as though some peoples had no freedom other than to choose between annihilation and submission. My country  the Central African Republic  feels impelled to reaffirm here its conviction that freedom and the right of self-determination are unique  universal and inviolable.That is why freedom  equality and justice must be established in South Africa  where we see the persistence of the iniquitous system of apartheid  based on the false premise of racial superiority  which denies the status of human being to the majority of its population  who are deemed to be non-persons. Apartheid divides human beings  separates them off and pens them up according to the color of their skin. Apartheid is undoubtedly the great moral challenge of our time  we therefore welcome such decisions as those taken at the Paris World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  and the new anti-South Africa stand taken by the countries of the European Economic Community  Canada and the Nordic States  to compel it to show more wisdom and political realism. Apartheid must be abolished  and all the people of South Africa  without distinction  must build a new society.Legality and right are on our side in the case of Namibia  which South Africa continues to occupy illegally  and whose people have for too long been held hostage. In support of this cause  the front-line States are paying a heavy price ir destabilization  interference and blackmail. As the representative of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAFO) said at the recent fourteenth special session of the General Assembly  that special session must be the last on the question of Namibia. The Security Council can no longer desist from implementing its own decisions  thus further postponing the decolonization of that African land and encouraging South Africa's continuous and persistent defiance of the authority of the United Nations. Namibia must regain its freedom and accede forthwith to national sovereignty  without any preconditions.With regard to Chad  a country which is both a neighbor and a friend  the Central African Republic wishes to pay a well deserved tribute to the Government led by President Hissein Habre for the remarkable  patient and tenacious efforts it has made to reconcile all Chadians. My country sincerely hopes those efforts will be successful; the results already speak for themselves. We believe that only peace and union can enable the people of that long-suffering country to participate in the enormous task of national reconstruction being undertaken by the Government of Chad. Therefore  faithful in its commitment to the principles of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  and particularly to that of the inviolability of borders  the Central African Republic calls for compliance with those principles in the case of Chad  whose territorial integrity must be restored.The Palestinian people too is entitled to a homeland. The failure to settle the question of Palestine  which is at the core of the Middle East situation  is the main reason for the daily violence in that deeply troubled part of the world. In the Middle East  even more than elsewhere  there must be multilateral support for the efforts and initiatives of the united Nations  including those related to the convening of an international conference to restore to the Palestinian people  united behind the Palestine Liberation Organization (PIO)  its national rights. It must exercise those rights in an independent State within secure and recognized boundaries*  this must be the case also for the other States of the region. Still on the Middle East  Iran and Iraq must heed the voice of reason and put an end to a fratricidal war which has gone on too long and is of deep concern to the international community owing to the enormous loss of life that it has caused. The Central African Republic sincerely hopes that Iraq's constant of willingness to find a just  negotiated political solution in keeping with the United Nations Charter will find an appropriate response in the region so that the carnage that engulfs the two countries may end once and for all.Similarly  we should seek to ensure implementation of the United Nations resolutions on Democratic Kampuchea. The Kampuchean people must be allowed  without any outside interference  freely to choose its future  recover its full sovereignty and build a neutral  non-aligned State. That is the unanimous will constantly reaffirmed by the international community  which at each session reiterates its conviction that the Kampuchean question must be resolved by peaceful means. Accordingly  my delegation supports the eight-point approach formulated by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  which has the advantage of proposing  in keeping with United Nations principles  a final solution to this question.The inviolability of the right of peoples to self-determination and its corollary  the equality of States  which is the basis of the universalist mission of the United Nations  must also prevail in the case of the Korean peninsula  where the Central African Republic hopes that the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people to reunification will be speedily attained. That means that the two parties  on the basis of the Joint Statement of 4 July 1972  must use peaceful means  and engage in direct  open dialog  without any outside interference. Similarly  the effort s that we are making to encourage this peaceful reunification and thus enable the Korean people  which has been divided for so long  to be reunited could in the meantime act on the principle of the admission  whether or not simultaneous  of the two Koreas to the United Nations.The values of freedom and democracy  equality and justice and tolerance  observance of which could have determined the settlement of all the questions that we have just mentioned and which do determine the balance of international peace and security  must  if they are to be better supported at the multilateral level  be profoundly integrated in the juridical and political systems of each of our States  because  we can then claim for them beyond national borders the respect accorded to them nationally.My country understands this and is now  under the guidance of President Kolingba  trying to establish the structures of a new democracy  based on the political reality in my country  the implementation of which will enable the people of the Central African Republic better to express their aspirations in keeping with these values.The fact that the Central African Republic has subscribed to the various legal instruments guaranteeing the rights of the individual - in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocol -clearly shows my Government's dedication to the protection of man and to the values inherent in man  the denial of which cannot be permitted. If this approach is shared by all the members of the international community  there is no doubt that through multilateralism we shall have made some progress towards democratization of international political relations  which will facilitate progress towards the advent of a new international economic order.The continuing worsening of the economic situation of the third worLd countries in general and the African countries in particular owing to the combined effects of the debt burden  persistent inflation and the drop in commodity prices has undoubtedly helped to spur a search for new approaches to allow the United Nations once again to play its proper role in the organization of multilateral co-operation. It is in this context that we should place the recent special session on the critical economic situation in Africa  held in New York  because for the first time the United Nations made a special effort to deal with the economic situation of one continent. Disaster was indeed knocking at the door then.The Program of Action adopted at that session to support Africa's economic recovery is undoubtedly an expression of a new awareness and solidarity.It was a specific manifestation of multilateralism  that is  of a common responsibility; an appeal for common efforts to understand and resolve questions relating to development. The widespread economic crisis  which spares no country  highlights complementarity  the close interdependence of the North and the South. It is the whole economy that governs relations between the two entities at that level that is being challenged  and a comprehensive solution must be found. This means that a genuine dialog must be started so that eventually we can restructure international economic relations on the basis this time of fairness and justice.Economic solidarity  it is true  can only supplement internal efforts. That is why my country  with the people's support  is making a resolute  intensive effort to reform the national economy. We welcome the fact that this is recognized by the international community  as are the recovery efforts by other African States.If translated into action  the solemn commitment made at the special session by many States of the northern hemisphere and some international organizations to support in various ways the economic recovery program for African countries would mean that we could not only firmly establish this solidarity but prepare fertile soil in which could germinate this new kind of North-South co-operation and for which the Central African Republic hopes so sincerely and at the center of which the United Nations would again play its full multilateralist role. Periods of crisis are more likely than periods of relative calm to give rise to changes in institutions or human attitudes; they are also more likely - and this is the danger - to give rise to an often egocentric interpretation of the values enshrined in the Charter  the scope of which might thus be weakened. They are also likely to bring about a unilateral approach  which endangers the advent of a peaceful world. A real determination is required  a collective effort and genuine solidarity  from the members of the international community  to ensure a resolute defense of these values whenever  wherever and in whatever circumstances they are challenged. For that purpose there is only one forum  the United Nations  and only one method  multilateral co-operation organized by the United Nations to that end  which must be constantly maintained  cultivated and strengthened. This approach will undoubtedly allow us to take vigorous action to create a climate of trust conducive to the realization of the ideals of freedom and democracy  equality and justice  tolerance and peace."
"25",1199,"CAN",41,1986,"May I first congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of this session and pledge Canada's full support.I should also like to wish the Secretary-General well after his recent surgery. His dedication and courage have been an inspiration to us all  and we are thankful that we can continue to rely on his leadership.In ray first speech to the General Assembly  two years ago  I described Canada as a ""friend"" of the United Nations. In fact  we are more than that. We believe this institution is essential to the safety of the world  and we defend it even when its actions are foolish or infuriating or wrong. Our country is thirtieth in population size in the world  but fourth in the size of our financial contribution to the United Nations system. Canada's commitment will not alter or change. But the commitment of Canada - and of other countries like us - will not alone protect the United Nations from the erosion of respect which is slowly weakening the Organization we built to bring the world together.When we gathered last year to celebrate the fortieth anniversary  a sad irony faced us: the United Nations was becoming more necessary and less effective.Who among us cannot list many issues that should be addressed and resolved here  but are not? Who among us has not thought of referring one or another issue to this forum  but then held back for fear that debate would serve only to exacerbate our differences? Our instincts tell us that this is the right place for issues of global importance  but we often fail to raise them. That failure is the expression of our fear. It has led us more and more to resort to blocs  to bilateralism and even to unilateralism  (spoke in French)During the General Assembly session last spring  it became obvious that there were some of us who were not yet convinced of the need for reform. For my part  I was unable to note either any marked reduction in rhetoric or any great progress towards pragmatism and the search for consensus. The only exceptions - and they should not have been exceptions but the rule - were the decisions taken by consensus on the struggle against terrorism and on the improvement of the situation in Africa. But even here that was only a beginning.I would be very pleased if I could state that we here had already renewed ourcommitment to the fundamental purposes of the Charter and had revitalized the Organization. Of course  such a result could not have been expected in the space of a year. Nevertheless  the period has been sufficiently long for progress to have been made. On the contrary  the threat of financial failure looming over the Organization has become even greater - and new doubts are being expressed regarding its relevance  (continued in English)We need reform on two fronts - financial and political. This session starts its deliberations with the consideration of the Report of the Group of High-Level Experts on the Administration and Finances of the United Nations. The 18 experts deserve our profound gratitude. There are some recommendations with which Canada might quibble. But this is not a time for quibbling. The recommendations should be accepted without change and applied as soon as possible. They would reinforce the significant measures of financial reform already undertaken by the Secretary-General. They key area that requires further discussion - the planning and budgetary process - is profoundly contentious. We are obviously divided. But we must find common ground lest the whole reform process be imperiled. Our acceptance or rejection of the report of the Group of 18 will be the litmus test of our commitment to renew the capacity of the United Nations to fulfill its mandate.Our budgets here are swollen by the accumulation of outdated and misguided programs. A thorough review would free resources for meeting needs that have long been relatively neglected. These include large areas of development  in particular the promotion of women and the promotion of human rights in general.We must also deal with the question of arrears and withholdings. At present  these amount to a total of $400 million. This shortfall has severely strapped the Organization. A fixed schedule of repayment  allowing for some flexibility  would provide a solution to the arrears problem. But even more important is the questionof withholdings  which  as the Assembly knows  threatens to cripple the Organization financially this year. We look to those States which are withholding to follow the example of the People's Republic of China  which  without any change in ""consistent principled positions""  has announced payment of accumulated withholdings of $4.4 million.The adoption of the report of the Group of 18 and the settlement of arrears and withholdings would address half the problem. The other half is more basic. There simply is no escaping the fact that world-wide support for this institution depends on its performance. There may be some who think that if the United Nations were flush with funds all would be well. But the stark reality is that the United Nations must be reformed politically as well as financially.We are in danger of becoming a caricature of the hopes expressed in 1945. This was to be a forum in which difficult decisions were to be taken: it has become a means to avoid them. When there is crisis  we have endless debate. When there is a need for hard compromise  we draft resolutions which defy agreement.Our publics are sensible. They want peace and prosperity and justice. They judge the United Nations by what we do together  not by what we say separately. They want results  not speeches. They hear our constant refrain about the need to perform - but if we have stopped listening to ourselves  they too will soon stop listening. The place to start is with administrative and financial reforms. Obviously  putting our house in order will not put the world in order  but it will protect and strengthen the only organization that can. Canada is a strong friend of the United Nations  but Canadians who are making sacrifices at home do not want to subsidize inefficiency here.To be sure  there will be resistance to reform. There always is. We either face it down  or risk slipping back into the shadows from which we emerged with so much hope in 1945. I cannot believe that any of us here would contemplate such a future with equanimity. None of us pretends that even a fully reformed United Nations will extinguish racism  unleash a global economic boom or put an immediate end to every regional conflict. Yet we all know the kinds of contribution that United Nations agreements can make to international peace  prosperity and social advancement. Resolution 242 (1967)  the law of the sea  and the Declaration and Covenants on human rights are but three that come immediately to mind  (spoke in French)In this International Year of Peace  we shall more than ever before be judged by our achievements in the fields of disarmament and arms control. All the members of the international community will  like Canada  applaud the resumption of dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union. President Reagan informed us of an exchange of letters with General-Secretary Gorbachev regarding new proposals on arms control. We welcome with satisfaction this direct and open participation of the two leaders in the negotiation process. The talks held last week by the United States Secretary of State  Mr. Shultz  and the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs  Mr. Shevardnadze  also contributed to improving the atmosphere of the relations between the two super-Powers. We can all cherish the hope that the resumption in Geneva of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of nuclear weapons and the use of outer space will make some progress possible. We are encouraged by the greater flexibility recently shown by the two parties in their efforts to achieve the shared objective of sharp reductions in nuclear weapons - reductions which will allow for the strengthening of the strategic balance and an increase in international security  (continued in English)The current focus of attention on nuclear arms reductions should not  however  detract from the necessity of similar progress in the field of conventional arms control. The results of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe have also added to the sense of momentum towards greater security and co-operation in East-West relations. Stockholm represents a signal accomplishment in bringing new openness and predictability to the conduct of military affairs in Europe.The establishment of agreed procedures for air and ground on-site inspections is a landmark achievement which could serve as a productive precedent for other arms-control negotiations. Canada  with its record of promoting constructive verification solutions  derives special satisfaction from having contributed to that outcome. It should facilitate the movement to the negotiation of more extensive measures of military restraint and reductions.Such signs of hope should spur the United Nations to tackle the broad range of important arms-control questions before it. Progress on one issue can unlock progress on others.Canada will strive for a ban on chemical weapons. We will continue to work to ensure that outer space is developed for peaceful purposes. We will be seeking to play an active role in strengthening the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Canada will again be supporting a comprehensive nuclear-test ban. That is a fundamental goal and one towards which concrete steps can and should be taken now. Canada welcomes President Reagan's undertaking that the United States of America is prepared first to move forward on ratification of the threshold test-ban treaty and the treaty on peaceful nuclear explosions and then to take subsequent measures to limit further and ultimately to end nuclear testing.We urge all nations to co-operate and  indeed  participate in the development of the verification techniques needed to provide the confidence necessary to ratify those agreements  which will enable us to plan the subsequent steps we must take in all areas of arms control. For verification is not just a question of technical capacity; it is a question of the political will to reach agreement on the application of technologies and techniques. In this spirit and in co-operation with others Canada will continue to work vigorously towards real progress on verification.A further critical task facing the United Nations is to buttress the international trade and payments system  now under great strain  and to stimulate the growth so desperately needed in much of the developing world. We are making some progress. Canada is encouraged by movement forward on the elaboration of the Baker Plan and by the agreement of Economic Summit countries at Tokyo to co-ordinate their economic policies more effectively. We particularly welcomed the unanimity of the agreement reached in the meeting of the countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to launch a new round - the Uruguay round -of multilateral trade negotiations.Those are all welcome signs of a growing recognition that we must work together in pursuit of a sound and fair international economic system.*A raison d'etre of this Organization is to create a more humane world. The most fundamental human rights embodied in the Charter and in United Nations human-rights documents are being systematically and grossly violated in a number-of Member countries. The reports of Amnesty International are an indictment of our age. In Afghanistan  a whole people has been tyrannized and millions of citizens made refugees. Around the world and every day people are being tortured and killed for their political and religious beliefs.One of the most distressing trends of the past year has been the deterioration of the situation in South Africa. The Government of that country has stubbornly refused to dismantle the abhorrent regime of apartheid and to adopt a system that respects human rights for all its people. It has instead imposed a draconian state of emergency. We have seen hundreds of deaths and more than 10 000 detainees.The South African Government's repressive policies can have no outcome other than more violence and  in the end  a cataclysm in which all South Africans  whiteand non-white  will suffer grievously. That would be tragic for a country so blessed in human and material resources.Canada has worked to intensify the international community's pressure against apartheid and has helped mobilize the special capacities of the Commonwealth to try to stop the destruction of southern Africa. Canada is implementing all the sanctions agreed to by six Commonwealth leaders in London last month. But pressure will only be fully effective if the international community stands as one  and I urge all countries  especially those with significant economic relations with South Africa  to implement further concrete measures on an urgent basis  (spoke in French)International terrorism threatens us all  and we must act jointly to fight it. The United Nations  acting in a manner that should characterize all of its activities  has set forth that goal and met that need during the past year. All Member States are in agreement regarding the threat posed by international terrorism. During the last session the Security Council unanimously and unequivocally condemned all acts of hostage-taking and kidnapping. At that same session the General Assembly unanimously condemned all acts  methods and practices of terrorism  wherever and by whomever committed. At that time  the Organization rose to the occasion admirably.Those declarations must  of course  be accompanied by concrete and specific measures. Canada  along with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  has launched an initiative designed to consolidate the structure of international law against terrorism. We propose the conclusion of an agreement under which all parties would undertake to pursue and to extradite all persons perpetrating acts of violence in international airports. I am sure that the international community will give that initiative its full support. I am also convinced that the collective will of the Members of the United Nations  expressed through concrete measures of this type  will be decisive in our joint struggle against this scourge of our era. (continued in English)I have touched on only a few of the issues with which the United Nations will have to grapple at this and future sessions. Difficult as these are  I remain confident that this institution can serve our common needs and serve them well. We have only to give it the means and the direction. Canadians  for their part  wish to have a strong United Nations capable of dealing pragmatically and effectively with global issues. At this session the Canadian delegation will be seeking every opportunity to join with like-minded States in realizing that goal. If I have dwelt on the need for reform  it is because I am convinced that it is still within our grasp.I can think of no better way to conclude than by recalling the words of my distinguished Canadian predecessor  Lester Pearson. At the eighteenth session of the General Assembly in 1963  he said:""the United Nations alone serves us all. It provides the only world assembly to protect and advance human rights and freedoms and human welfare  to reduce and remove the causes of conflict. ...whether it discharges that great role and fulfills its great responsibilities  depends on us. When the United Nations fails  its Member Governments fail. When it succeeds  all the plain and good people of the world succeed."" "
"26",1260,"CHL",41,1986," Please permit me to begin my remarks by expressing to you  on behalf of my Government and my delegation  our warmest congratulations  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. This constitutes not only recognition of you as an individual  but also a demonstration of appreciation for your Government's prolific work in the United Nations.I also wish to take advantage of this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude and felicitations to the outgoing President  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  a person closely linked to Chile who brought a brilliant diplomatic career to a close as President of the world's most important forum.I should also like to pay a tribute to Ambassador Javier Perez de Cuellar  who is completing five years at the head of this Organization  directing it during a particularly difficult period.We have commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and have started on the fifth decade of the life of this Organization with growing uneasiness. The United Nations today is but a pale reflection of the Organization that emerged from the ashes of the Second World War  as an example of the international community has enlightened interest in giving concrete expression to mankind's hope for lasting peace. Today that institution  which gave rise to so many hopes  is experiencing not only a financial crisis but also one of confidence and destiny.The responsibility for the financial crisis rests with the majority of Member States that do not make their contributions on time  with those that adopt the most extraordinary attitude of making selective payments  Favoring the programs that coincide with their political objectives  and with those that have assumed the illegal attitude of reducing their contributions unilaterally  in violation of the international obligations to which they had freely committed themselves.In addition to this crisis  there is another  one which is far more serious. It arises from our peoples' loss of confidence in the system and in its ability to achieve the objectives for which it was created. Although it was created to be an instrument for assuring peace  the United Nations has instead become a forum of sterile confrontation. The Organization has thereby lost its ability to be a protagonist in international life and its ability to impose prudence in the conduct of States and to generate efficient initiatives for solving problems.The lack of agreement to move forward in natters of great importance and the real stagnation into which we have been propelled by a lack of willingness to achieve consensus on vital matters have been accompanied by a tendency to indulge in resounding verbiage and rage signifying absolutely nothing. Thus we have a steady torrent of innocuous resolutions that have given rise to traditional stands that choke creativity and at the same time establish a doctrine under which the capacity for innovation  for acting on the inter national scene  simply does not exist. The successive efforts made to bring about change have not been sufficient to generate effective and necessary dialog capable of pulling the Organization out of its state of immobility. Immobility cannot be concealed by an excessive increase in the number of meetings or by the proliferation of documents which the meetings produce. Through inertia and lack of courage to check a senseless process that seems to be leading nowhere  it has foundered into a voracious calendar that only consumes time  money and hopes.The impossibility of facing up to this reality  which is becoming more and more complex and dynamic  has led the United Nations to a position so far removed from reality that the world it reflects today is a fictitious one.Despite these problems which disturb us  Chile has faith in the ideal of the United Nations  for the Organization must not only be an instrument for resolving international problems  but it must also express mankind's ideal: the possibility of living  developing and progressing in peace; of living in a world where countries rich and poor can work together in harmony to achieve those objectives.Despite the failures  our faith is justified by the successes of theUnited Nations that represent concrete expressions of that ideal  for example theprocess of decolonization  which has peacefully brought almost 100 nations into the international community.Then there is the priority treatment and definitive presence in today's world that the United Nations has brought to the search for development.Throughout its existence the Organization and its specialized agencies have made substantial contributions to the economic development and political independence of nations.	/While the world has become more independent  imposing a logic that no countrycan avoid  and while the need for multilateral co-operation appears more evident we note that because the United Nations has become inoperative a tendency to seeksolutions beyond the framework of the Organization by consolidating parallelmechanisms has become noticeable. This trend must be reversed in order to restorethe United Nations to its original competence. This will require political determination.In the course of this session the General Assembly must pronounce itself onthe report on the administrative and financial situation of the Organizationprepared by the Group of Eighteen Intergovernmental Experts from various nations.The report and the final treatment it is given by the General Assembly couldconstitute the first step towards restoration of the United Nations to the positionit deserves as the principal protagonist on the worrisome international scene in the final years of this century.There is no doubt that one of the most unstable situations in the world is that which persists in the Middle East. Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) contain the fundamental elements for the achievement of a lasting and stable peace in the region. At the same time  there can be no solution ofthe problem without recognition of the right to free determination of the Palestinian people and its right to establish a sovereign State. It is necessary to reach just settlements that guarantee the peace and security of all States  including Israel's right to live within secure and internationally recognized borders. That is the only way in which the Middle East can cease to be a region in perpetual crisis.The South African situation is cause for concern and uneasiness. At the root of the conflict is that Government's apartheid policy  which Chile has repeatedly rejected.At the same time my Government supports the efforts of the international community  the Sscretary-General and the Security Council to obtain Namibian independence by peaceful means. One milestone in that process is Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which guarantees a realistic solution that assures the Namibian people of the right to free determination as well as territorial integrityand national unity.With regard to the Korean situation  we support the inter-Korean negotiations as a realistic and peaceful approach free from outside interference to achieving a harmonious solution of a situation that has dragged on for years. We recognize the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Korea in this respect. In line with its traditional defense of this Organization's principles of universality  my country maintains that the presence of both Koreas in the United Nations would contribute to bringing the parties closer together and achieving a negotiatedsettlement.We have noted with satisfaction the attitude that President Victor Paz Estenssoro of Bolivia has adopted towards my country. The Chilean Government hopes that the process of rapprochement we have initiated with Bolivia will be successful and produce concrete results and begin a period of effective co-operation between our countries.We observe with indignation and sorrow the Soviet obstinacy in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea  causing death and desolation among nations eager for freedom and peace. The Soviet Union's invasion of those countries has been deservedly condemned by the international community because of its illegitimate and illegal violation of the principle of self-determination. The liberating impetus of their oppressed peoples is more powerful than any opposing armed force  as has been demonstrated by the fact that the resistance continues despite the brutal effort of the Kremlin to crush both countries.The initiatives of the Secretary-General with regard to Afghanistan and of Prince Sihanouk with regard to Kampuchea deserve our determined support since they are the only realistic initiatives that have been undertaken to resolve those conflicts.We are also horrified by the tragic circumstances affecting the Lebanese people  which has long been linked to Chile through close ties of friendship. The people of Chile are shocked by the continuous flow of reports of death  suffering and tragedy coming from Lebanon. Many Lebanese have made Chile their home  and therefore those reports affect us deeply. We voice our fervent hope that peace and tranquility will soon be restored in Lebanon so that its people can once again devote themselves to the tasks of reconstruction and development.My Government has always been keenly interested in initiatives that might lead to international peace and security and has noted with great interest and approval Brazil's proposal that the South Atlantic be declared a zone of peace and co-operation. That initiative pursues important objectives in the areas of economic development  social welfare and peace which ought to be endorsed by the General Assembly.It is necessary to maintain the priority of those general objectives and to shun external factors alien to general interests such as private interests or the positions of some countries that only serve to distort the objectives and generosity of the Brazilian proposal.The acute world recession of recent years  which has had grave economic  political and social consequences for the developing world  has emphasized the effects of the crisis I mentioned earlier.The developing countries have been obliged to adjust their economies  with painful political and social repercussions  and have had to bear the greater part of the cost of a situation for which the macroeconomic policies applied by the industrialized countries have been responsible  we have noted with consternation that while this heavy burden has been imposed upon us  the developed countries have liaited adjustments in their own economies  thereby incurring the greatest imbalances in contemporary history. This has only served to further aggravate the crisis.We are convinced that the final solution of the crisis will be obtained only through an integrated and cons is tent approach to the urgent problems of development  trade and finance  including the very grave debt problem.To achieve that objective the industrialized nations must make a fundamental change in their economic policies  recognize that they share responsibility for the existing problems  bring about conditions which would allow truly free international trade to prevail without the obstacles that today arbitrarily disrupt the exports of the developing world  and reverse the de-capitalization process Favoring the developed nations  a process which The Chilean people have been among those adversely affected in the Latin American region. However it is fair to recognize that they have known how to face the crisis with courage and abnegation  lb day we are firmly on the road to economic recovery; we are achieving significant growth and scrupulously complying with our financial commitments.Chile has noted with great concern the serious deterioration in the observance of the principle of non-intervention  a legal principle essential to coexistence and the harmonious development of relations between States.Chile has had to reject many instances of intervention in its affairs in recent years. Under the pretext of being concerned about human rights  attempts have been from outside to manage our political affairs  to establish procedures and plans that are not our own  and objections have been made to the path chosen and the rules laid down in our political constitution  adopted by the Chilean people themselves. Those who criticize the human rights situation in Chile ignore the obvious progress we have made in that regard; the decisions of the courts of justice have been objected to and challenged  and I believe that the only reason terrorist activities have not been applauded is that many other countries are suffering from the same scourge.What is worse  and bitterly ironic  is that many of our critics and accusers do not know what true democracy is and what human rights are. They do not respect the right of other nations to govern and decide their own destiny  and it is their declared policy not to give their own peoples freedom and democracy.The international community is appalled to see that some States have committed themselves to training  financing  supplying and sheltering terrorists. In doing so those responsible are not only blatantly violating the principle of non-intervention  but are also committing a genuine act of aggression  and making themselves accomplices in crimes against humanity.That is why one of the matters that urgently demand concerted action by the international community is the unprecedented escalation of terrorism  which is today striking brutally at a large part of the world community  violating the basic norms of human rights.We are fully aware that it is the inescapable responsibility of each Member State to combat this scourge  which is threatening both the internal peace of States and international peace. Therefore  we believe that all nations must share the international responsibility of co-ordinating efforts to pursue and punish  in accordance with their own laws  those who commit such criminal acts or lend their direct or indirect support.Chile has been the victim of criminal acts of that kind for more than 15 years. They did not cease even when the Government of Popular Unity was in power  as the Communist Party  which formed part of it  proclaimed that its goal was to gain not only political power  but total power  and that to that end all means could be used.Today my country is the victim of the same brazen aggression. Indeed  in early August  as we informed the Security Council at the time  our armed forces discovered in parts of northern and central Chile an enormous quantity of arms and military equipment that had been smuggled into the country  mainly by sea  in view of the long Chilean coastline.That impressive arsenal - particularly impressive in relation to a small country such as Chile - includes  among the weapons found so far  3 260 American-made M-16 automatic rifles; 214 Belgian-made light machine guns; 114 Russian-made Katyusha rocket launchers  of the same type as those now being used in Afghanistan; 170 TCW antitank rockets; almost 2 million rounds of ammunition for the weapons I have mentioned; 3 000 kilograms of high explosives; 2 000 hand grenades; 1 800 rocket-propelled bombs; and other weapons which it would take too long to list here. In summary  it amounts to more than 80 tons of armaments  worth more than $10 million. Since the original discoveries  other arms deposits have been found even in Chile's capital city  confirming the magnitude of the terrorist challenge we face.We believe that a substantial portion of that arsenal has not yet been found and seized. That is the essential reason for the temporary emergency measures   which we have had to take throughout our territory.My Government has formally requested international co-operation to determine the origin and source of those weapons. It should be noted that their destructive power  and the information we have gathered on how they were smuggled into the country  show that we are facing not only a terrorist operation  but one of a truly military character  planned and financed from outside Chile  with the deliberate aim of promoting violence  destruction and death  and plunging the whole country into civil war. Calculation of the number of victims that the use of all those arms could have led to clearly demonstrates the scale of the tragedy that has been successfully averted. Moreover  such an assault would have represented a massive violation of human rights.We know who are behind all these actions; they have not tried to conceal their involvement. We believe that the international community cannot remain indifferent or passive when faced with this new type c* aggression  since what has been attempted against Chile today  if left unpunished  could lead to an irreversible disaster for the region as a whole.Thus we must again accuse the Chilean Communist Party  which has time and again publicly declared its decision to conduct an armed struggle to definitively establish a totalitarian Government in Chile so that it could then assist other similar terrorist or guerrilla movements operating in our continent. The continuing campaign of calumny provided daily by Radio Moscow and other media for over 13 years is further proof of that statement.In addition to these illegal and immoral actions  those responsible have had the audacity to claim that they have become the champions of international peace and freedom  while launching a campaign designed to sow doubts about the truth of the facts reported by Chile  in order to escape the onus of their actions or merely to hide the truth about the shocking discovery of that arsenal from the world.This is the culmination of an infamous process  encouraged by the countries of the Soviet bloc  through which violence has been incited in Chile by a persistent campaign  both internal and external. The Western nations  and particularly those of Latin America  must note that those arms were not destined exclusively to weaken the present Government of Chile. The violence which is being attempted is part of the framework of a long-established criminal plot with the ultimate aim of undermining the essential values that inspire the Western nations.As I have said  the illegal importation of a gigantic arsenal of Soviet arras into Chile was first noted in 1971  and at that time  too  the world was shocked. There is abundant reason for linking the process to which ray country is being subjected with actions that have caused disruption or harm in other countries. It is part of the network of international terrorism  which is also affecting other nations in our continent. Its aim is very clear: to prevent the consolidation of democracy in Latin America.Those who seek that goal do not know how mistaken they are. All the democratic sectors in Chile  including the opposition  have condemned the illegal import of arms. But the most serious aspect of the discoveries is the confirmation that the purpose of introducing those arms was to provoke a civil war in Chile. For on 7 September this year the President of the Republic was the target of terrorist groups employing arms from the arsenal I have mentioned  in a heinous attack aimed at taking his life and creating national chaos. The toll in that tragic episode  the only one in the history of Chile involving a Chief of State  was five dead and nine seriously wounded.Demonstrating criminal resolve and audacity  those concerned sought to assassinate the President and his escort  demonstrating that they knew no humanitarian or moral restraint. That is the belligerent terrorist logicsupported by international communism.Despite those very grave events  the Chilean Government continues to dedicate itself to the process of democratic institutionalization  confident that the clandestine importation of arms  the attempt to assassinate a prominent person and the goal of revolution through subversion served only to unite all Chileans who are opposed to violence and are lovers of peace.In denouncing this aggression before the United Nations  we solemnly reiterate our unwavering intention to return Chile to full democracy and my Government's commitment to pursue the process of institutionalization in accordance with the modalities set out in the 1980 Constitution which binds the Government and the governed alike.It is quite easy to confine one's self exclusively to a critical analysis of the United Nations. We do not wish to remain at that stage nor is it our style. Chile  at this time  wishes to share with the other delegations some projections for the future.We are convinced that there are what may be called areas of consensus  which require an in-depth study and represent a useful field for harmonizing the efforts of the Organization. If we direct the dynamism of the United Nations to those areas and leave aside those which are at a standstill  we can create a climate of greater confidence in the Organization.My country wishes formally to propose that the United Nations concentrate or dedicate its preferential action to the areas of consensus. We have identified some aspects as being susceptible of generating agreements or leading to productive negotiations.The first is the utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Such a valuable instrument of development requires the more active involvement of the General Assembly of the United Nations which  without disregarding the important contribution of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  provides the appropriate political and juridical framework so that all States may benefit increasingly from this technology.The world cannot continue to merely observe in amazement the destructive effects and the distorted use of nuclear energy. On the contrary  we want to recover the positive elements and have that precious source of energy produce life instead of death.Secondly  the structuring of regional disarmament mechanisms. In view of the standstill in the global disarmament negotiations  we feel that we should seek action in the field of regional disarmament. These mechanisms should contain instruments leading to the creation of a net protecting the countries  or  at least  reducing the dangers which the potential situations of conflict arising in various parts of the world today entail.It is obvious that the generalization of a mechanism of this type would free resources for development. As far as ray country is concerned  the proposal is not an abstract one. On the contrary  it constitutes an important goal of its foreign policy. That is why  we immediately voiced our support for the declaration of President Alan Garcia of Peru regarding regional disarmament.In addition  as a consequence of these principles  we initiated  earlier this year  a series of meetings between the High Commands of the armed forces of Chile and Peru in an effort to find a concrete formula which would permit reductions in arms expenditures.We believe there are other regions in the world in which agreements or similar initiatives could and should be undertaken  conducive to diminishing the scourge of force and to actively promoting conditions Favorable to international peace  security and justice. In this  there is no doubt but that the United Nations can be catalyst and driving instrument for an initiative of this kind.Thirdly  there is the use of outer space for exclusively peaceful purposes. The international community observes with growing interest the technological challenge stemming from the exploration and exploitation of outer space. Chile like the other developing nations  aspires to the benefits which may be derivedfrom a broad system of co-operation in the outer space area. Hence  it isextremely important to start out on road landing to the adoption of an international agreement that legislates on permitting access by all peoples to the distribution of the benefits of space technology. Outer space  the common heritage of mankind  is regarded by nations as a promising area since it would provide them with the means for protecting and developing their natural resources and for employing the most effective tools in their plans for economic and social growth.Access to the distribution of the benefits of such activity also undoubtedly implies acknowledgment of the right of the Powers exploiting outer space to a commensurate compensation for their efforts and their scientific and technical research.Fourthly  there are the problems related to environment. Many problems today affect humanity as a result of the depredation of its natural resources and the contamination of air  sea and land. This has created a political imperative which the General Assembly of the united Nations cannot ignore. A physically rarefied environment is a crime against the elementary norms of human quality required for life in dignity. Hence the importance of emphasizing the study of these subjects and of evaluating  for example  the problem of cross-boundary contamination and the deposit of waste in third countries  thereby creating dangerous and noxious situations.Fifthly  we have the world's food problem. The international community has been stunned by the food crisis affecting some African countries and  in general  the development tragedy in that continent. Thus the international community is emotionally prepared to undertake an in-depth action to resolve the world's food problem  with emphasis on the problems of Africa.This is a new subject for consensus which our efforts and our imagination should promote.In short. Chile is firmly convinced that there are areas of consensus such as those we have referred to and briefly described  and that the time has come tobegin a process of integrated and comprehensive negotiation  since there are commondenominators amongst them. Essentially  they can be the sources of eventualinternational agreements and constitute a productive source for guiding the UnitedNations along a technical path  free of ideological considerations.In making these proposals  which must necessarily be refined and attuned to the political moment and the respective forums  we are motivated only by a sense of international public service  free of narrow dogmas and contingent sectarianism. The United Nations cannot continue to be the setting of sterile confrontations and of quarrels and disputes that erode its very credibility. It is particularly important to plan for the future and take realistic and pragmatic advantage of subjects susceptible of bringing nations together in their own lasting interests.When Western Europe still suffered the after-effects of the Second World War  allied nations and their rivals in that conflagration modestly conceived  in a determined and imaginative manner  a route that had certain points of consensus. That effort kept growing and gradually became transformed in what is today the European Community  a major process in the history of co-operative relations among nations.Today  when we again face the need of starting out on the road to the ideal ofthe United Nations  let us consider the process of the European Community. Theoption of the present hour is co-operation and understanding  or disintegration and confrontation.My Government is convinced that the modest but resolute Method of finding points of consensus will enable us to take firm and realistic steps towards a more integrated  unified and peaceful word."
"27",1306,"CHN",41,1986," May I begin. Sir  by warmly congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the united Nations General Assembly. I am sure that with your ability and experience you will make outstanding contributions to the work of the current session. At the same time  I should like to extend my high respects to Mr. Jaime de PiniSs for his fruitful work as the President of the fortieth session.A year ago we were meeting here to commemorate the grand occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. We expressed our ardent desire for the maintenance of world peace and promotion of international co-operation  put forward quite a few proposals and voiced concerns and anxieties over the turbulent international situation. The year 1986 is the International Year of Peace. The people of the world have made various efforts for peace and the forces against war and for peace have grown further. In November last year the United States and the Soviet Union held a summit meeting  indicating in their joint statement that ""nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought""  and acknowledging that the two countries bear special responsibilities for halting the arms race and carrying out nuclear disarmament. During their talks and dialogs on the question of arms control and disarmament  each side indicated that it would reduce its strategic nuclear weapons by 50 per cent. Since then there has been a certain degree of relaxation of international tension. We welcome this development.Nevertheless  people cannot fail to see that the United States and the Soviet Union are still far apart in their views and positions on the question of disarmament. At present the arms race is still going on  and various proposals and ideas for disarmament remain only on paper. No substantive progress has been achieved on disarmament and no solutions have been found to regional conflicts. The root cause of international tension still exists. Therefore  people have no reason to feel relieved about the present world situation. The creation of tension and confrontation goes against the wishes of the people of all countries  including the United States and the Soviet Union. The popular will for peace is an irresistible trend in the world today. The people of all countries must persist in their arduous efforts towards relaxation of international tension and the maintenance of world peace.We hold that the key to disarmament lies in true sincerity in favor of disarmament  and the greatest test of the sincerity of the two major nuclear Powers is whether or not they will take practical steps to be the first drastically to reduce their armaments. We hope that they will reach an effective agreement through serious negotiations  take real actions for disarmament and not indulge in rhetoric  still less use disarmament talks as a cover for the arms race. Xn the present circumstances  it is necessary for them to be the first jointly to undertake not to launch a nuclear war or resort to the use or threat of force against other countries  so that favorable conditions may be created for disarmament and the relaxation of international tension.China has all along opposed the arms race and its extension to outer space. We stand for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons and for the substantial reduction of conventional weapons. We are in favor of the peaceful use of outer space. Zn his statement on 21 March 1986  Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang gave a comprehensive and systematic elaboration of the Chinese Government's position of principle on the question of disarmament  including such issues as nuclear disarmament  conventional disarmament  intermediate missiles  space weapons  chemical weapons and the relationship between disarmament and security. At the same time  China has taken actual steps towards disarmament in many areas. By the end of this year  it willcomplete the seduction of the number of its troops by 1 million. China has been cutting its military expenditures year by year and a considerable portion of its military industry has been shifted to civilian production. Some military airports and naval ports have been turned to civilian purposes. The Chinese Government has officially declared that it will no longer conduct atmospheric nuclear tests.The basic views of the Chinese Government on disarmament are as follows.The two super-Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  which possess by far the largest nuclear and conventional arsenals in the world  bear special and unshakable responsibility for disarmament and should take the lead in drastic arms reduction. Nuclear disarmament should be carried out simultaneously with conventional arms reduction  and the two should promote each other.As the question of disarmament affects the security interests of all countries in the world  every country should have a say in this question. The United Nations should play a greater role in disarmament. The two major nuclear Powers should heed  respect and accept the reasonable demands and propositions of various countries  especially the small and medium-sized countries. No disarmament negotiations or agreements between the major nuclear Powers should jeopardize the interests of other countries.Disarmament and international security are closely related. Efforts to achieve disarmament should be combined with those for the maintenance of world peace and security. In order to ease international tension and maintain world peace  it is necessary not only to achieve effective arms reduction but also to oppose hegemonism and power politics  check aggression and expansion and resolve regional conflicts.In keeping with the consistent stand of our Government on disarmament  the Chinese delegation will submit to the current session of the General AssemblyThe war of Vietnamese aggression against Kampuchea has been going on for eight years. Although Viet Nam has dispatched large numbers of troops and employed every means available  it has never succeeded in subduing Kampuchea. The so-called irreversible situation in Kampuchea as claimed by Viet Nam is nothing but a myth. Facts have demonstrated that Viet Nam cannot possibly succeed in its attempt to annex Kampuchea by force of arms. The only way to a settlement of the Kampuchean question is the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. The earlier Viet Nam extricates itself from the quagmire of the war in Kampuchea  the better it will serve the Vietnamese people and their national interests. The traditional friendship between China and Viet Nam will be restored provided Viet Nam effects a genuine withdrawal of troops from Kampuchea and gives up its anti-China policy.Last March the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea headed by President Saradech Norodom Sihanouk put forward an eight-point proposal for a political settlement of the Kampuchean question. This proposal is fair and reasonable and conforms with the principles in the relevant resolutions adopted at successive sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. It has offered a reasonable basis for a political settlement of the Kampuchean question and thus won support from many countries. It is the consistent position of the Chinese Government that the Kampuchean question should be settled on the basis of the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and the Declaration of the International Conference on Kampuchea. China firmly supports the eight-point proposal of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and all the proposals and suggestions conducive to a just and reasonable settlement of the Kampuchean question put forward by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other countries.We stand for a political settlement of the Kampuchean question. After the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops  just and reasonable solutions to Kampuchea's internal problems should be worked out by the Kampuchean people and by the various political forces in Kampuchea through consultations on an equal footing  free from external interference. China hopes that Kampuchea will be a peaceful  independent  neutral and non-aligned country and would not like to see any single group monopolize power. China seeks no selfish interests in Kampuchea. We are ready to join other countries concerned in an international guarantee that Kampuchea will enjoy the status of a peaceful  independent  neutral and non-aligned country. This is China's basic position on the question of Kampuchea.The occupation of Afghanistan by foreign troops is an encroachment upon its independence and sovereignty and poses a grave threat to the security of the adjacent countries and peace in Asia. The international community has all along strongly demanded a just and reasonable settlement of the Afghan question at an early date in line with the relevant United Nations resolutions. The eight rounds of indirect talks in Geneva held under the auspices of the United Nations have failed to achieve substantive progress on the crucial question of the withdrawal of foreign troops. If the Soviet Union sincerely desires a political settlement of the Afghan question  it should implement the relevant United Nations resolutions and present a time-table acceptable to the international community for an early withdrawal of all its troops from Afghanistan.It is the desire of the people to see relaxation of tension on the Korean Peninsula. We support the positive efforts made by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea and its reasonable proposals and demands for dialog between the North and the South  tripartite talks and the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea. We hope that the parties concerned will work together to ease the tension on the Korean Peninsula so as to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea.It is disturbing that the situation in the Middle East remains tense and turbulent. We have consistently supported the just struggle of the Arab countries and the Palestinian people. For them to sink their differences  strengthen unity and act in concert is a basic guarantee for victory in the Arab and Palestinian national causes. We hope that the parties concerned in the Middle East will seek a just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question through political negotiations so as to bring peace to the region. To this end  the national rights of the Palestinian people must be restored  and Israel must abandon its policy of aggression and expansion and withdraw from all the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967. At the same time  the right to existence of all countries in the Middle East should be recognized and they should live in friendship on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.The widening and escalation of the Iran-Iraq war has posed a grave threat to peace and stability in the Gulf region and brought enormous suffering to the people of the two countries. Both Iran and Iraq are China's friends. We hope that the two neighboring countries will exercise restraint and refrain from intensifying the war so as to create an atmosphere necessary for conducting peace talks and bringing about a cease-fire. We sincerely hope that in accordance with the norms of international law  they will settle their disputes on mutually acceptable terms through peaceful negotiations and bring an early end to the war.Owing to external intervention  the situation in Central America is becoming more complicated. In order to put an end to the prolonged turmoil and bring about a just peace in Central America  it is imperative to respect the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of all countries in the region and do away with all external interference and power politics so that the people of these countries will be able to solve their own problems. Foreign military threat against  and intervention in  Nicaragua in violation of the norms governinginternational relations have aggravated the situation in this region and naturally met with the opposition of the international community. We support the just and reasonable principles put forward by the Contadora Group for solving the problems in Central America and hope that the Group will succeed in its efforts The situation in southern Africa is deteriorating and becoming even more volatile  as the South African authorities perpetrate racist atrocities  cling to their illegal occupation of Namibia and engage in grave provocations against the neighboring countries. The Pretoria regime's sanguinary suppression of the black people in South Africa is a challenge to human dignity and international justice  which has aroused the great indignation and strong protest of the international community. The World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa held by the United Nations and the special session of the General Assembly on Namibia have played an important role in mobilizing the international community for intensified struggle against South African racism. We firmly endorse effective sanctions against the South African authorities and support the South African people in their heroic struggle against racism and for racial equality. We support the just struggle of the Namibian people for national independence and the efforts of the independent States in southern Africa to safeguard national security and bring peace and stability to the region.This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights. These two instruments are of positive significance to the realization of the purpose and principle of the United Nations Charter concerning respect for human rights. The Chinese Government has consistently supported this principle of the Charter. Just as in all other countries which were victims of imperialist and colonialist oppression  there were no human rights to speak of in the semi-colonial  semi-feudal old China. It is only following the founding of the People's Republic of China that Chinese citizens are able to enjoy extensive democratic rights. In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of China  the Chinese Government has adopted various measures to ensure the enjoyment by its citizens of all kinds of fundamental rights. With the progress made in economic development and structural reform in the past few years  there has been a steady improvement in socialist democracy and the legal system in China. Never before have the Chinese people enjoyed such a high degree of democracy and freedom as they do now.We have noted with concern that  although the United Nations has formulated and adopted a number of international instruments on human rights  gross and massive violations of human rights continue to occur in many parts of the world as a result of colonialism  racism  foreign aggression and occupation. Moreover  interference in other countries' internal affairs in the name of protecting human rights is also a common occurrence. We call on the international community to make joint efforts to check these violations of the principles of the Charter.In discussing the current international situation we must pay close attention to the question of development in the world. Over the past year the developed countries have maintained a low economic growth rate and many developing countries are still in grave economic difficulties. International economic relations are becoming increasingly imbalanced and irrational. The prices of most raw materials and primary products for export by the developing countries have kept falling and the export of their manufactured products has run into numerous obstacles owing to trade protectionism in the developed countries. External debts are weighing more and more heavily on the debtor countries. The developing countries are in desperate need of development funds  but   while capital inflow keeps dwindling  an abnormal phenomenon of reverse flow of funds has occurred.Such developments serve to widen the gap between the developed and the developing countries  which will not only do great harm to the developing countries but also have grave consequences for the developed countries in the long run. The developed countries account for only one quarter of the world population of nearly 5 billion while the remaining three quarters are in the developing countries. The world economy cannot grow steadily without the economic growth of the developed countries  but at the same time its steady growth also depends to a great extent on whether the developing countries can overcome their difficulties and revitalize their economies. Therefore  helping to boost the economic growth of the developing countries will contribute both to the common prosperity of the world economy and to world peace and stability.Following political independence  the developing countries are all committed to their domestic economic development. In the process they have made headway in a search for development strategies  economic structures and economic policies suited to their respective national conditions. Many of them have made readjustments and introduced reforms in their economies  with gratifying results. In addition to their own efforts and promotion of South-South co-operation  it is of great importance to the economic growth of the developing countries to improve North-South relations. As the developing countries are still fettered and harmedby the inequitable international economic relations  it would be difficult for them to attain the goal of economic development smoothly by merely relying on their own efforts. He hope that the developed countries will  in the overall interest of the world economy  help create an international environment favorable to the developing countries. The international community should take practical measures in trade  finance  development and other international economic fields to facilitate the flow of capital and transfer of technology to the developing countries  further increase their access to markets and reduce their debt burden  thus contributing to the overall growth of the world economy.The special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa  held last May  gave expression to the concern of the international community for Africa's economic recovery and development. We hope that the parties concerned  particularly the developed countries  will fully honor their commitments so as to ensure the full implementation of the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 198C—1990  which was approved unanimously by the session.International relations are now undergoing a great change. The newly independent countries which emerged in the post-war period  the numerous non-aligned and other small and medium-sized countries  regardless of their different situations  all treasure independence and oppose power politics. They desire peace and stability and oppose war and tension  and they all want to get actively involved in international affairs and play their part in maintaining peace and promoting international co-operation. It is no longer realistic simply to take ideology and social system as a criterion for differentiating countries and international political groupings. The time is gone for ever when a big Power or power center could manipulate international relations according to its wishes. Therecently concluded Eighth Conference of Beads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries proved once again that the Non-Aligned Movement is playing an important role in the international affairs of the day. The trend towards multipolarity in international relations and the growing aspiration of the peoples to take their destiny into their own hands are an inevitable historical development and constitute a positive factor making for peace.We are of the view that all countries  regardless of their ideologies and social systems  should establish and develop relations on the basis of the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence.We are in favor of dialog  which is the correct way for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. Facts show that only through peaceful negotiations and consultations on an equal footing is it possible to remove contradictions and differences between States  forestall international conflicts and ensure international security.Obviously  in order that dialog can be conducted and yield positive results  the use or threat of force must be abandoned  the sovereignty and security of all States respected and all acts of aggression and expansion stopped. In no circumstances should a country be allowed to impose its will on others.The Chinese people are now going all out in the drive for China's material  cultural and ethical advancement  determined to turn China into a modernized socialist country with Chinese characteristics through the efforts of several generations. China firmly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace  whose fundamental aim is to preserve world peace and secure an enduring peaceful international environment for its socialist modernization. Peace and development are inseparable. To have peace and development  we need friendship  co-operation and strengthened relations with other countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence.This year we in China have started to implement the Seventh Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development. In the coming five years we shall basically complete the overall restructuring of our economy. Meanwhile  we shall adhere to the policy of opening up to the outside world  improve the environment for investment and expand our external economic relations. We are promoting the sustained and steady growth of China's economy by carrying out reform and the policy of opening up to the outside world  and we want to ensure successful and uninterrupted economic development by pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace. China's current domestic and foreign policies have proved to be sound and effective and in the interests of the people. We shall adhere to these policies with unshakable determination. The United Nations has entered upon its fifth decade since its founding. It has tremendous successes to its credit  but it also faces problems and difficulties. Since the restoration of its rightful seat in the United Nations China has always abide by the purposes and principles of the Charter  actively participated in the work of the Organization and endeavored to perform its duty as one of the permanent members of the Security Council.The financial crisis confronting the United Nations at the present time has caused widespread concern. We are of the view that the United Nations should undergo rational structural reforms  but such reforms must be aimed at strengthening  not weakening  the role of the Organization and must observe  not violate  the principle of the sovereign equality of all Member states  as provided for in the Charter. It is our sincere hope that the United Nations will  with the joint support of all Member States and through consultation^ on an equal footing  take the necessary measures to overcome the difficulties it faces and improve its efficiency  so as to achieve even greater success in its endeavor to safeguard world peace and promote international co-operation."
"28",1386,"CMR",41,1986,"My delegation is pleased to see you. Sir  presiding over the forty-first session of the General Assembly. The important issues on the agenda of this session will undoubtedly call upon your leadership qualities and oriental wisdom  your experience as an internationalist and your vast diplomatic skills.We pay tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  for his valuable contribution to the work of the historic fortieth session of the General Assembly.We salute the return to better health of our friend Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the United Nations Secretary-General. In a year that has been particularly difficult for international relations  this Organization has drawn strength from the courage and dedication he has demonstrated in the performance of his heavy responsibilities. We wish him the very best for the future.We assemble once again at a time when our generation faces grave challenges to many of our universal hopes and aspirations. At stake are our values  based on affirmations of basic human needs. Every sphere of existence seems to be dominated by a crisis of the human spirit  a crisis deriving from an apparent inability to comprehend the truth of the contemporary interdependence among States and among peoples.It is essentially the bases of those various crises that we must continue to address together  whether or not the year marks a numerical milestone in history. We must keep faith with a universal will to survive. An overdose of subjectivity would destroy values of the common good.The past year has witnessed the convening of a number of special sessions. The objective in each case was to highlight an aspect of the critical issues of our time. We recognized the circumstances and history underlying the fate that cements our destiny. Yet what has happened since does not inspire the kind of hope that gives impetus to the solution of international problems. It is our hope that this session will seriously address those critical questions in specific terms  avoiding recourse to confrontation and the hardening of national positions. We pledge ourselves to give of our best and to co-operate in the selection and treatment of urgent questions. It is clear to us that the resolution of many of these questions would enhance the cause of lasting international peace  security and development. We shall now set forth some of the views and policies of the Cameroon Government and peoples in an attempt to promote that advancement  (continued in French)Last year  with all the solemnity due the event  we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of our Organization. At that time  we expressed our gratification at the tremendous political  economic  cultural and legal achievements of the Organization during its four decades of existence.Once again  we declared our firm attachment of the peoples of the entire world to the ideals  purposes and principles of the Charter that the founding fathers had made into rules of positive conduct for nations. Beyond those initial manifestations of gratification  however  we were  notwithstanding the hope that had been earlier aroused  distracted by the various upheavals that seemed to be making ever darker the prospects of our permanent quest for peace  security and wellbeing for all. Today  more than ever before  in this International Year of Peace  that distraction is exacerbated by anxiety over the challenges of the future.First  there is the abhorrent crime of apartheid with all its implications in southern Africa and in the world.The massacres of the black population  the daily incidents of violence  the restoration and tightening of the state of emergency  the increase in the number of barbaric raids against the courageous front-line States  which lack any adequate means of defense - all those developments bear witness to the stubbornness of thePretoria racists and to their determination to perpetuate a system ofdehumanization in South Africa and to extend it throughout the entire region as an integral part of their sinister plan to establish a constellation of satellite and vassal States in southern Africa.In illegally occupied Namibia  the implementation of the United Nations plan for that Territory's peaceful accession to independence continues to be thwarted by the maneuvers of Pretoria and its friends and allies.Cameroon considers Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) to be the only valid bases for the process intended to lead Namibia to independence while respecting its territorial integrity  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the Namibian people's sole authentic representative.Once again  we cannot but reject the delaying tactics designed to establish a linkage between implementation of resolution 435 (1978) and the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola.For Cameroon  the adoption of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter against the supporters of apartheid is clearly a decisive way to exert the kind of pressure that will hasten the demise of the criminal system of apartheid in south Africa and the unconditional liberation of Namibia. We urgently appeal to the Security Council to embark resolutely and immediately upon that course  and we appeal particularly to' those of its members who bear a special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and who on other occasions have always been quick to come to the defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms.We urge the United States Government  the Governments of the States members of the European Economic Community  the Governments of the Nordic countries and others to go beyond the stage of selective and more or less token sanctions and to impose  with firmness  measures of constraint that would exert decisive and significant pressure on the rebellious South African Government.The vast majority of the peoples of America and Europe have expressed their rejection of the abhorrent system of apartheid and have urged their Governments to adopt comprehensive and mandatory sanctions.Peoples throughout the world are aware of the serious threat inherent in the explosive situation in southern Africa and its effect on peace and security in the sub-region  in Africa and in the world.Loyal to its commitments  our country this year had the responsibility and the honor to host an international seminar on aid and assistance to the peoples and movements struggling against colonialism  racism  racial discrimination and apartheid  the conclusions of which will be submitted to the present session for consideration.We appeal here and now to States Members and to the institutions of the United Nations system  as well as to non-governmental organizations  actively to contribute to the implementation of the recommendations that emerged from that seminar.This is also the place to express our support for the results of the Paris International Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  the Vienna International Conference on the Immediate Granting of Independence to Namibia and of the fourteenth special session of the General Assembly and to hope that they will be effectively implemented.As a sign of active solidarity  our country this year invited our friend Sam Nujoma  the President of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  who carried out an important official visit to Yaounde  during which President Paul Biya reiterated to him the total support of the Government and people of Cameroon for the sacred cause of the immediate liberation of Namibia.Cameroon reiterates its support for SKAPO and the liberation movements of South Africa  the front-line States  the United Nations Council for Namibia  the Special Committee against Apartheid and the Secretary-General of the United Nations  all of whom are making efforts worthy of encouragement.We cannot pass over two other sources of conflict - namely  the situations in Chad and the Western Sahara.In the case of Chad  we are pleased at the success of the efforts made under the aegis of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and several African Heads of State in order to effect the national reconciliation of Chad. This country  a neighbor of my own  has for a number of years been beset by a perturbed and disintegrating situation due to internal dissension aggravated by all sorts of interference.But over and above reconciliation  which remains to be consolidated and perfected  Cameroon believes that it is more than ever necessary to weigh carefully the very crux of the problem in Chad - that is  the question of foreign interference and of the occupation of part of its territory - and to that end to work for the respect of its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity in order that Chad - stabilized  at peace and unified - can  under the leadership of its legal Government  pursue the tremendous task of national reconstruction and development.In regard to the question of the Western Sahara  Cameroon believes that the solution to the problem can be found in the implementation of the resolutions of both the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations  which advocate the organization of a referendum on self-determination under the auspices of both organizations. It is for this reason that we are pleased at the willingness expressed by the parties concerned to pursue contacts - which are for the moment  of course  indirect - as part of the efforts undertaken along these lines by the Secretary-General of the United Nations with the encouragement of the OAU.We are similarly worried by the emergence  persistence and intensification of tension in other parts of the world  first and foremost in the Middle East. Theparticulars of the situation prevailing in that region are well known to this Assembly. The position of my country is similarly well known.We can only deplore the absence of agreement on a common formula that could serve as the basis for negotiation for the various parties to the conflict. In all events  we are convinced that the United Nations has a major part to play in the settlement of that issue  the most serious implication of which is the threat it poses to international peace and security. That is why Cameroon would like to reiterate its support for the resolutions adopted both by the Security Council and by the General Assembly.It is in that spirit as well  in the exercise of its sovereignty and its freedom of choice  in its choice of non-alignment and without any hostility to anyone else whatsoever and without any intention of breaking away from its traditional partners in the region  that Cameroon recently decided to re-establish diplomatic relations with Israel. Our profound conviction is that the search for a just  lasting and peaceful solution to the problem of the Middle East must transcend the blocked situation of conflict that is neither real war - but rather latent - nor negotiations  nor real peace. Rather  it should resolutely be geared towards open  pragmatic and constructive dialog based on the principles and resolutions of the United Nations and should furthermore take account of the need to safeguard international peace and security as well as the fundamental interests of all parties concerned. In particular  in means the recognition of the State of Israel within internationally recognized frontiers and of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  independence and a homeland.That is the construction which should be placed on the Israeli-Cameroon communique which ratified the re-establishment of diplomatic relations  as follows: ""Both parties expressed their determination to work for peace and stability in the Middle East  in Africa and throughout the world and both are convinced of the need to promote the process of peace between Israel and the Arab States on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)."" Cameroon is convinced that it is along these lines that the international community and all people of good will should work. Certain recent signs would lead us to believe that an evolution in this sense is possible.Recent pronouncements by Mr. Yasser Arafat at the eighth Non-Aligned Summit -in Harare  when he announced his acceptance of the principle of negotiations on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  appears to us to be a positive step. Similarly  the attitude of certain Israeli leaders seems to have evolved along the right lines to the extent that they no longer systematically reject the principle of 'holding an international conference to lay the foundations for a lasting peace in the area  which has always been the main concern of the United Nations. This new trend should be encouraged and supported by all States and by the international community.We must  however  deplore the fact that the sometimes ambiguous positions of various States in the region on the delicate question of Palestine have not yet been clarified - not only to contribute to progress in finding a just and lasting solution  but also to ally the fears of those who wish to make a contribution to and show active solidarity with the noble struggle of the Palestinian people.In this regard  the authority of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the legitimacy of its leaders should not constantly be called into question bycertain countries which nevertheless proclaim their commitment to the Palestinian cause.Efforts to resolve problems in other parts of the world  where focal points of tension exist  are also of concern to us. This is particularly true of Latin America  where we praise the efforts made by the Contadora Group  or Asia  where the ASEAN countries continue to make a valuable contribution to peace. The strict observance of the cardinal principles of the Charter  including the peaceful settlement of disputes  non-interference  respect for territorial integrity and national sovereignty  as well as the right of every people freely to choose its future  should be observed by all.On the threshold of the twenty-first century we are still faced with the appalling scandal that poverty  disease and illiteracy remain the daily lot of millions of human beings. This unquestionably constitutes a serious threat to the very foundation of the peace and security of nations and of the world. It results from deep structural intolerances in the world economic system. These imbalances  which are found in such spheres as trade  finance  money  technology  industry  transport and communications  exacerbate an already profoundly unfair situation. The industrialized countries determine erratic variations in commodity prices and welcome the advantages they reap. They enjoy the positive results of their balance of trade - which  however  does not always derive from genuinely good economic performance  but rather from depressed terms of trade  speculation and monetary manipulation. The recovery of some of their economies has had no major impact either in terms of true world economic recovery or of the social advantages we might have expected. Neither does it have any substantial positive effect on the economies of poor countries  which continue to bear the brunt of the disastrous effects of this situation  which involves regression  stagnation and excessive indebtedness.Yet we know that in this era of interdependence individual States cannot resolve today's major economic problems by themselves or in small groups with selfish and narrow interests. This means that when rich countries block every effort to establish a new international economic order they are jeopardizing not only an improved life for the peoples of the South but also the interests of their own peoples. We deplore the lack of political will  which has thus far prevented the beginning of global negotiations  which are the appropriate framework for jointly seeking solutions based on justice and equity.The convening earlier this year of a special session on the critical economic situation in Africa testifies to the gravity of the crisis in our continent. We are gratified at the attention the international community has given that situation and  especially  at the General Assembly's adoption of the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. The main lesson of that special session concerns Africa's acknowledgment of its own primary responsibility and commitment regarding the economic and social development of the continent in the framework of the Lagos Plan of Action and Africa's Priority Program for Economic Recovery adopted by African Heads of State or Government. It also concerns recognition that this commitment can lead to success only if there is similar determination  even a pact of solidarity  on the part of the international community to create a world environment propitious to the success of our countries' efforts to achieve economic  cultural and social development.We hope that despite an occasional display of hesitancy during the special session  the rich countries will make a concrete contribution in support of Africa's own efforts. It is therefore extremely important that the United Nations and the specialized agencies of the United Nations system work to establish follow-up machinery for the co-ordination of action to be undertaken internationally. Likewise  countries which have expressed their willingness to participate in Africa's Priority Program for Economic Recovery should make the necessary contact with Africa's national  sub-regional and regional follow-up bodies  and get the priority operations of the plan under way.As if to exacerbate the problems engendered by the crisis I have just described  natural disasters - of late particularly massive - have stricken the world  plunging families and nations into grief and reminding us all of the common destiny of mankind. My country  Cameroon  was recently the victim of a geological catastrophe which took a particularly heavy toll. The efforts of the Governmentand the people of Cameroon were promptly and massively supported by a great wave of international solidarity. I wish to take this opportunity solemnly to reiterate our gratitude for the good will of all those who came to our aid on that occasion.My country views the question of human rights and fundamental freedoms as being of great importance. I shall not go again through the arguments which have too long been used to point the finger at certain States; Cameroon believes that human rights should be understood in their broadest and most universal sense  and should take into account the economic  social  legal  civil and political aspects of the concept. In the same way  Cameroon deplores the advent of new kinds of violence that blindly strike out at innocent victims  of which terrorism is the basest and most reprehensible manifestation.A strange paradox of the twentieth century is that  in the face of serious challenges demanding a high sense of awareness  we are gradually day by day giving up on improving the human condition by taking advantage of the enormous possibilities of the latest achievements of science and technology  instead we are accumulating more and more so-called means of security  which far from guaranteeing security actually point us on the road to the total destruction of mankind.The problem of world peace and security can no longer be viewed in purely military terms; there is now a close link between peace  security and development. That means that  well beyond purely military aspects  the true foundations of disarmament and international peace and security are to be found in economic justice and equity  in confidence-building measures  and in the promotion of good-neighborliness and peaceful coexistence.Africa has always supported initiatives to promote peace  security and constructive co-operation amcng nations  because we consider peace to be a precondition for stability and development. Consequently  we continue to followclosely developments in the relations between the super-Powers  since the actions of the world's two most heavily armed and powerful countries have a great influence on the chances for bringing about peace throughout the world. We hope that the leaders of those two Powers will continue the dialog they began last November. We hope their meetings will not consist of empty monologues that aggravate international tension  but will rather make it possible to undertake fruitful  constructive action towards the conclusion of specific  effective disarmament agreements. The super-Powers have the responsibility and the duty to take the first steps and to set an example  particularly as regards nuclear disarmament.We reiterate that disarmament  the reduction of tension between States  respect for the right to self-determination and independence  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the strengthening of international peace and security are all closely linked. Progress in one of these sectors would have a positive impact on all the others and  by the same token  failure in one sector would necessarily have a negative effect on all the others. It is essential that this be borne in mind if progress is to be made towards an agreement on a realistic Program for comprehensive security for the international community as a whole.Nevertheless  responsibility for world peace and security cannot rest with the two super-Powers alone. The United Nations should be seen as the regulator of our common higher interests  of which peace and security are the determining elements. It is thus essential to strengthen the role of the United Nations in any approach designed to lead to international peace and security.We are pleased by the very thorough consideration given to the proposals on these lines made by Cameroon at the last session of the Disarmament Commission. We hope that at the present session  too  the Assembly will give careful attention to this matter.We welcome the practical steps taken by the Secretary-General to ensure an effective beginning of the work of the United Nations Regional Center for Peace and Disarmament in Africa  in Lome  Togo. We hope that this important Center will have the material and financial support of the international community.The relationship between disarmament and development is of particular importance. We deplore the postponement of the International Conference to deal with the subject  which it was originally planned to hold in Paris  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 40/155. We reaffirm our support for the convening of that Conference. Disarmament and development are two of the most pressing needs at the present international juncture. The achievement of these goals would make a major contribution to stabilizing international relations  as contemplated in the Charter  to promote the advent of a world free from the threat of war and poverty. However  peace  security and development would not rest on sound foundations if they were not based on a reformed world system geared to universally accepted juridical norms. In this connection we appreciate the dynamism demonstrated by our Organization in its standard-setting activities  in particular the codification and progressive development of international law. The Vienna Convention on the Law on Treaties between States and international organizations or between international organizations is to be attributed to that same dynamism. We hope that any remaining reluctance can be overcome so that this Convention may be put into effect without delay  along with a number of other instruments  in particular the agreement on the creation of a common fund for commodities and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  signed at Montego Bay.In this connection we welcome the agreement adopted recently on the procedures and mechanisms for considering requests for registration as pioneer investors in sites for exploration of the deep sea-bed and the settlement of disputes relating thereto. This encouraging action should give new life to the work of the next session of the Preparatory Commission of the International Sea-Bed Authority and of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. At the same time  it represents a notable point of reference in progress towards the operational phase of the new juridical regime of the oceans. Cameroon will continue to give active support to this Convention and the work of the Commission  which will pave the way towards a new era of peace  security and economic co-operation in the seas and oceans.At a time when this effort to codify a revised world legal order should be intensified  it is regrettable that the United Nations  which is the keystone of an orderly world system  is as was recently the case with the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  in the grip of a serious crisis. It is essential above all that all Member States honor their financial commitment to the Organization so that it is not paralyzed and can function in a viable fashion and to continue to be the indispensable center where the nations of the world endeavor to reconcile their views and coexistence for common ethical purposes.It is undoubtedly these preoccupations that have motivated the appeal made freauently by the Secretary-General since last year. Our country is one of those that responded favorably to that appeal  not only by paying its full part of our quota of the regular budget  but also by making available to the Organization considerable voluntary contributions  notwithstanding our difficult economic situation. This is further evidence of our devotion to the Organization and the ideals  principles and objectives which it represents.Nevertheless  despite the financial aspects of the present crisis  it is really a reflection of the political will of certain Member States which already enjoy considerable influence and privilege in the Organization to get almost exclusive and sometimes abusive control of its decision-making machinery  thus endangering the ethical basis and even the future of multilateralism.. As we had occasion to say last year  if  in order to be effective  the structures and methods of the United Nations must constantly be improved  this must be done by democratization of international relations in order to achieve increasingly effective  dynamic and equitable participation by all the members of the international community in the conduct of world affairs on which the fate of each and every one of us depends.It is in the light of these considerations that we shall consider the recommendations submitted to the General Assembly by the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations  and any other proposals relating to the structure  ir.anagement and budget of the Organization.It is hoped that wisdom and tolerance will guide the action of all states in the international arena and that the general interest of the international community will prevail over selfish  sectarian considerations. Only then United Nations be able to play its full part. In this International Year surely the time has come for all of us to reiterate our solemn commitment together resolutely to assure and bequeath to future generations a better free from the scourge of war and the specter of poverty.will the of Peace  to work world"
"29",1428,"COD",41,1986,"On behalf of the delegation of Zaire and on ray own behalf I should like at the outset to congratulate the President on his election to guide the work of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-first session. It is a pleasure for me to see him presiding over the General Assembly  particularly since he is a son of the third world and a gifted statesman. His political and diplomatic experience  together with his thorough knowledge of the United Nations system  guarantees the success of our deliberations. The delegation of Zaire  need I say  assures him of its whole-hearted co-operation.To his predecessor. Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  an experienced figure in the United Nations and a well-known personality  we express our delegation's appreciation for the outstanding way in which he guided the fortieth and commemorative session of the Assembly as well as its thirteenth special session  on the critical economic situation in Africa.Lastly I should like to pay a special tribute to our Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cue liar  for his brilliant report on the work of the Organization  which offers a lucid and profound analysis of the major problems that concern the international community. That objective and courageous study of the explosive situation in South Africa and the present state of the economies of the developing countries confirms the justified apprehensions of the Non-Aligned Movement with respect to those issues.The forty-first session of the General Assembly has begun at a time when the international community is deeply disturbed by the patent inhuman injustices imposed upon the blade majority in South Africa by a white racist minority sustained by certain Powers. The Pretoria regime is seeking to perpetuate its illegal occupation of Namibia and to impede that Territory's accession to independence.The racist regime's constant defiance of the international community and the way in which it acts like a dominant Power exploiting the region are illustrated very clearly by its acts of sabotage and terrorism directed against neighboring independent States it wishes to destabilize because they are helping the black nationalists in South Africa aid Namibia.Several rounds of negotiations to restore peace and security in that part of Africa have met with but one response from the Pretoria regime: systematic refusal to make any compromise and recourse to military incursions into the neighboring States.Front-line States are well aware of the misdeeds  the barbarous and bloody repression committed by the racist troops from Pretoria  which  over recent years  have resulted in the deaths of several thousand men  women and children  as well as in the destruction of the economic infrastructure of those countries. Zaire welcomes the unstinting support offered by the Eighth Non-Aligned Summit to the front-line States. This is clear evidence of the fact that the great majority of the United Nations Members condemn the Pretoria racist regime and support the legitimate struggle waged by the black people in South Africa to recover their fundamental rights. The delegation of Zaire  which supports mandatory  comprehensive  binding sanctions  unreservedly  against the Pretoria regime  nevertheless considers that the international community must give its total support to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) so that the latter may find an African solution  which can  as speedily as possible  promote the restoration of peace and   security in southern Africa. This will enable all the countries in the region to ensure their economic and social development within the context of interregional co-operation  while guaranteeing the territorial integrity and sovereignty of their States.Consequently  Zaire urgently appeals to all those countries which have a special relationship with the Pretoria regime to intensify their pressure on South Africa so as to persuade it unconditionally to release Mr. Mandela and all the other political prisoners  thus bringing about conditions favorable to the establishment of a political climate propitious to negotiations between blacks and whites aimed at setting up a democratic regime. The time has come for all peoples committed to peace and justice to demonstrate their solidarity with the nationalists of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan African Congress of Azania (PAC).In Namibia the minority white regime in South Africa is continuing its systematic plunder of the natural resources of the Territory in collusion withoutside economic interests. This is in violation of United Nations resolution and Decree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia  which was adopted by the United Nations Council for Namibia in 1974. The racist Government is continuing to take steps to jeopardize the territorial integrity of Namibia. It is seeking to detach Walvis Bay from Namibia and to proclaim its sovereignty over the Penguin Islands and the other offshore islands. Never  in recent times  has a regime been subjected to such condemnation  reprobation and recrimination. Because of its intransigence and refusal to put an end to apartheid  sanctions against the regime are being considered by the overwhelming majority of the international community. Nevertheless  notwithstanding such isolation  the regime persists in raising major obstacles to Namibia's accession to independence. To justify its illegal presence in the Territory  it is seeking to subordinate Namibia's independence to considerations which are totally unrelated to Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  a resolution which has to date been accepted as the sole valid basis for a peaceful settlement to the Namibian question. In this regard the Security Council should play a primary role in maintaining international peace and security  rather t^ aiding behind legal quibbling  which is tantamount to tacit support for the Pretoria regime.My delegation therefore considers that the United Nations should take urgent steps to ensure that the United Nations plan for Namibia is fully applied.The continent of Africa faces other trouble spots apart from those in the South. I am referring to Chad and the Western Sahara. In Chad we are witnessing a dramatic challenge to the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the Organization of African Unity. I have in mind particularly respect for sovereignty  political independence  territorial integrity  non-interference in domestic affairs of States  non-recourse to force in relations between States andthe peaceful settlement of disputes. The situation in Chad constitutes a serious threat to peace  stability and security in Central Africa  but above all it represents a threat to the maintenance of a balance which is necessary throughout the African continent as a whole. Recourse to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter by a legitimate government which has been the victim of blatant external aggression has resulted in many interpretations by certain Member States; but those same States  when they are themselves attacked by a force from outside  are better placed than anybody else to understand the meaning of Article 51. The same applies with respect to the occupation of part of a State's territory by armed forces  supported and supplied from outside  in order to overthrow the established government. If it is unanimously recognized that such de facto occupation is illegal and constitutes a threat to peace and security  then the same must apply with respect to Chad. That country  a member of our Organization  is undergoing a period of division of its territory  which is being split into two parts; the northern area is occupied by forces supported from the outside.The United Nations must therefore adopt a resolution during this session reaffirming the principles of the territorial integrity of Chad and the inviolability of its frontiers. It must also invite any outside occupying forces to leave Chad. The people of Chad are entitled to freely exercise their sovereignty and self-determination. It is up to them alone to work for a reunification within the context of national reconciliation brought about by the N'Djamena Government.All the parties concerned by the problem of the Western Sahara are in agreement on the idea of organizing a referendum under the auspices of the United Nations. My delegation supports the commendable mediation efforts carried out by those parties with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in closeco-operation with the current Chairman of the OAU in accordance with resolution 104 of the twentieth summit of the Organization of African Unity.In the Middle East no progress has been made since last year and tensions continue in the area  despite resolutions adopted at the fortieth session of the General Assembly. One of those called for the organization of an international conference on this issue  a matter which has been on the General Assembly's agenda for well-nigh 41 years now. In that region the parties in conflict have opposed any spirit of dialog and negotiation  whereas the Security Council decided  in resolution 338 (1973)  that negotiations should begin immediately.The international community thus has a duty to prompt the protagonists to accept the idea that they must overcome psychological  historical  legal and other obstacles in order to achieve peace. This peace presupposes  first of all  justice and equality  because the Arab people in Palestine  like the people of Israel  are entitled to a homeland and a State. That was understood from the outset by the United Nations General Assembly  which  on 29 November 1947  set forth the principle of a Jewish State and a Palestinian-Arab State  when it adopted resolution 181 (II) relating to the partition of Palestine.Secondly  that peace can be brought about only through implementation of resolution 242 (1967)  adopted by the Security Council on 22 November 1967. That resolution lays down the conditions for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle Bast. They are: the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force or by war; the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from Arab territories occupied in 1967; the termination of all states of belligerency; respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and its right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force; the guaranteeing of a just settlement of the refugee problem; and the guaranteeing of the territorial inviolability and political independence of every State in the region.Finally  this longed-for peace in the Middle East is possible only if there is recognition of the rights of the Palestinians  because the violation of those rights is at the very heart - indeed  was the origin - of the conflict in the Middle East.Various General Assembly resolutions - 2535 (XXIV) of 10 December 1969  3236 (XXIX) of 22 November 1974 and 3376 (XXX) of 10 November 1975 - have placedPalestine question at the core of the Middle East conflict  by channeling efforts towards the search for a comprehensive solution  by reaffirming the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  by recognizing the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian people  and by establishing the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. There can be no doubt at all that the full implementation of those resolutions would contribute decisively to a comprehensive final settlement of the question.The Republic of Zaire places its hopes in the United Nations  which  as part of its historic responsibilities  gave a State to the Jews of the Diaspora and decided to create a Palestinian Arab State - and it must proceed to establish that State.In the international community's continued consideration of the situation in Asia  four other problems are of concern to it - namely  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  the Korean question and the Iran-Iraq war.The first two questions result from the violation of the principles of the sovereign equality of States; respect for the sovereignty  political independence and territorial integrity of States; non-interference; non-use of force or the threat of the use of force in international relations; and the peaceful settlement of disputes. These illegal acts are in conflict with the spirit of the Charter  without which free rein would be given to the excesses of irrational urgings.That is why Zaire believes that a just and lasting settlement of the questions of Afghanistan and Kampuchea must be found through the withdrawal of all foreign forces from those territories  whose peoples aspire to live in peace  independence  honour and national dignity  and to remain full members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.With respect to the Korean question  my delegation urges continuation of the dialog between the two Koreas  in the clear interest of their people.In Asia  furthermore  two brother countries - Iran and Iraq - which are also members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  are waging an endless war that has caused countless loss of life and considerable material damage  while the United Nations remains powerless to produce an appropriate framework for negotiations on halting hostilities. My delegation once again urgently appeals tothose two brother nations to come to an understanding so that reconciliation and fraternity may be achieved.In Central America  we must encourage the implementation of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in that region  in accordance with the expressed wishes of the signatory States.The achievement of international peace and security  which are the primary purposes of the United Nations  should be sought by all Member States with a view to creating » climate of confidence between peoples. But  unfortunately  peace is constantly threatened by acts of terrorism  which have now assumed disturbing dimensions. Resolution 40/61  adopted by the fortieth - commemorative - session of the General Assembly  invited all States to take all appropriate measures at the national level with a view to the speedy and final elimination of the problem of international terrorism  to fulfil the international obligations they have assumed and to prevent the preparation and organization in their territories of acts directed against other States.The dimensions which international terrorism have taken recently are evidence of the determination of certain Member States not to implement that resolution. Hence  the present session must recommend appropriate measures to eliminate international terrorism and promote relations of trust between States.The arms race is a powerful tool for those who follow a policy of recourse to force in international relations  a policy of intimidation and subjugation  of hegemonism and expansionism. The arms race increases the gap between the developing countries and the industrialized countries and reduces to naught the efforts to establish the new international economic order  to which the industrialized countries refuse to adhere.Moreover  the mobilization of large material  human and financial resources for an increase in nuclear weaponry cannot be justified in any way when we know that the overwhelming majority of mankind suffers from hunger  poverty and want. This diversion of resources is pure selfishness. That explains the determination of the nuclear Powers to keep the price of the raw materials from the developing countries at the lowest possible level  for the sole purpose of building up stockpiles of them.These same Powers are opposed to the launching of global negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order with a view to restructuring international economic relations.In other words  part of the economic difficulties facing the developing countries that are commodity producers are caused by the nuclear-arms race. Thus  the relations between North and South  rather than improving  are becoming worse. We see an increasing deterioration in the terms of trade  the excessive indebtedness of the third world and an even greater imbalance between industrialized countries and developing countries.Indebtedness  which has a direct influence on the growth of the developing countries  entails considerable budgetary burdens that prevent the carrying out of investment programs. At the present time  when Africa is looking to the implementation of the United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  adopted by the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa  it would be highly desirable if the undertaking by the international community to provide up to 30 per cent of the financing of the program for 1986-1990 could be translated into concrete action.Out of a desire to achieve the recovery of its economy  the Republic of Zaire has agreed to sake heavy sacrifices  accepting the plan for economic and financial restructuring proposed by the International Monetary Fund. Broadly speaking that plan consists of reducing public expenditure  freeing prices and encouraging the private sector.Responding to the appeal of their Head of State  Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko  Founder-President of the Popular Movement of the Revolution and President of the Republic  and as proof of their fidelity and steadfast devotion to him  the people of Zaire have for four years demonstrated discipline and a spirit of sacrifice. We have observed  however  that the rigorous implementation of that policy has led to restriction of investment credits  a drop in production and a galloping increase in the prices of basic necessities. Furthermore  the absence of agricultural credits means that that sector has been experiencing serious stagnation  if not outright recession  which has resulted in obstacles to improvement of the standard of living. Whereas  of course  the primary task of any Government is to foster the social conditions of its people. This situation  which has virtually throttled our economy  has also led to a reduction in the production capacity of the agricultural and industrial sectors and to increased inflation.Is it right to expect the developing countries to be forced to continue to set aside considerable sums of money to pay off their foreign debts at a time when their export earnings have dropped sharply as a result of the fall in commodity prices?Zaire  while reaffirming its readiness to pursue the program with the International Monetary Fund  nevertheless considers  in the light of its own experience  that the Fund's policy should take greater account of the demands of our countries' economic and social development instead of pursuing a policy that could  at the present time  be regarded as a new form of veiled colonialism.Zaire considers that debt repayment should not be achieved at the cost of the living standards of the peoples of the third world and of investments that are necessary for their countries' progress and development.As a seater of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Group of 77  Zaire will work with the other members of those groups to achieve the goals of collective self-reliance and international co-operation tailored to present-day realities.In this connection  Zaire intends to continue to participate actively in the work of the United Nations. It fully appreciates the reconsecrations made by the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations. My delegation will dead  with those recommendation when the Group's report is discussed by the Assembly. At this stage  however  my delegation would like to reaffirm its steadfast devotion to the principle of tbe sovereign equality of Member States enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We ardently hope that those recommendations say lead to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations and the purposes and principles of its Charter  which must not be infringed.In concluding  I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to a situation that we unanimously deplore. On the threshold of the twenty-first century  the black race continues to be the object of scorn  while its human dignity is denied. It is against that background that the President of the Republic of Zaire  Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko  has launched the idea of creating a league of black African States. That  we feel  could serve both as a rallying point for the black diaspora around the world and as an appropriate framework for co-ordination and discussion of problems peculiar to the black race.I wish the forty-first session of the General Assembly of our Organization every success in its work."
"30",1474,"COG",41,1986,"At the 22nd session of the summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of Africa  held in Addis Ababa last July  my colleagues and brothers entrusted to me the weighty responsibility of presiding over the Organization of African unity. It is in that capacity as well as on behalf of the People's Republic of the Congo that I now address this Assembly.The special opportunity provided by this forum of the United Nations prompts me first to pay a particular tribute to our world Organization  whose efforts in the service of Mankind and particularly of Africa reflect in a significant manner the hopes vested in it by our peoples.I should like also  Sir  to extend to you my congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-first session. I am persuaded that thanks to your personal qualities and your wealth of professional experience this session's work will proceed fruitfully and successfully. I assure you of the constant support of Africa in discharging your heavy responsibilities.My gratitude goes similarly to your predecessor as President  Ambassador de Pinies  who so tactfully guided the work of the General Assemblyduring the fortieth session.I should like also to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  who throughout his term of office has been able to effect reconciliation and rapprochement and to lead the Organization in a climate characterized by what has come to be called a crisis of multilateralism  while at the same time never failing to give African problems all the importance theydeserve and to recognize their urgency.I would recall that the Organization of African Unity has always adhered loyally to the ideals of the United Nations  whose efforts to promote peace and development it has always supported. Indeed  the ideals of the two organizations to a certain extent overlap. This is borne out by the African States' great appreciation of the role played and the actions taken by the United Nations system.In our opinion  this work  often carried out in difficult circumstances  deserves the sustained attention of all States  which should make more funds available to the world Organization so that it can carry out properly the tasks defined in the Charter. It wishes to do so  as shown by the excellent report of the Secretary-General; the only thing lacking is the ability to translate into concrete action the consensus that so frequently emerges among us.In an international political system of increasing complexity  one feature of which is the growth of contradictory influences  it is more than every necessary to affirm that the United Nations is an irreplaceable instrument in the service of man  peoples and States.As a counter to the spirit of destruction  injustice  the instinct to dominate and the impoverishment and enslavement of peoples  the United Nations is an important political enterprise which brings its full influence to bear on the conscience of present and future generations.The United Nations has provided Member States with a forum for consultation where positive responses have been given to the many problems confronting our people  regardless of the differences between our countries and peoples  in terms of structure  levels of development and political and economic choices.Whether dealing with the problems of collective security  dialog between the rich and poor countries  the economic and social crisis or the problem of peace and disarmament  the world Organization has always been able to encourage thinking that is directed to finding a better approach to those problems  and to define clearly the appropriate lines of action  which have now resulted in a series of measures that we must implement both individually and collectively.Over a period of 41 years the United Nations system has become an indispensable institution  and we hope for its success and further strengthening. In a world divided by bitter antagonisms  where solidarity is breaking down and where interdependence  the need for which is so clear to everyone  is yet being thwarted by national selfishness  how can we not earnestly hope for the strengthening of the sole framework  the only institution  where men of different ways of thinking  from all countries  can still sit side by side  using their own particular genius and special characteristics to establish and then strengthen the necessary dialog between nations and cultures?The Organization must certainly be kept in being. Consequently we are deeply concerned by the crisis of multilateralism. We believe that that crisis in which the Organization now finds itself  and which is the subject of an in-depth analysis by the Secretary-General in his annual report  as well as by the Group of 18 intergovernmental experts  can not be regarded merely as a financial crisis. It touches upon the very philosophy of international relations in our tine  and the degree of credibility given to the multilateral system  which has been patiently built up over 40 years. We therefore say yes to reform  if its purpose is to strengthen this valuable instrument  because a choice ""between a world with the United Nations and a world without it would simply be a choice between the future  promising solidarity  mutual understanding and peace on the one hand and  the past  meaning mistrust and the use of force as a means of settling disputes  on the other.Obviously improvements are necessary and desirable to ensure more rationalization  with a view to greater efficiency and work that is more closely geared to the noble aims of the San Francisco Charter. But the necessary changes should not lead to justification of the Organization's very existence being called into question.How can we guarantee international peace and security  which are essential for the survival of nations and the development of the poorest countries  if the role of the United Nations and its prerogatives are diminished?In this very Hall we proclaimed 1986 the International Year of Peace. That initiative was a clear reflection of the deep concern that the deterioration of the international climate has caused us.The deployment in certain parts of the world of arsenals of weapons of great range and precision has contributed to the creation of doubts in men's minds and a state of anxiety among peace-loving and justice-loving peoples  and it has thus slowed the momentum of the United Nations in introducing a system of collective security.However  hopes can be based on the setting up of channels for consultation to bring about a constructive dialog in the world. In that connection  the bold initiatives taken by the United Nations  including an appeal for general and complete disarmament  are praiseworthy and deserve to be encouraged. Similarly  we should encourage the two main nuclear Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States  to continue a dialog that is vital for the whole of mankind.Hence we wish to make a solemn appeal here to the super-Powers and the medium-sized Powers to make a genuine and sincere effort to bring the disarmament negotiations to a successful conclusion. In that regard  we particularly welcome the most recent agreements reached at Stockholm as a first step towards mutual trust between those on whom mankind's very survival depends.Nevertheless  the peace to which the peoples of the whole world so earnestly aspire should not represent merely an absence of war or a dialog between the major Powers alone. Peace also means our societies and economies being able to ensure for each human being the increasing satisfaction of his fundamental needs.It follows that mankind can enjoy a comprehensive and lasting peace only when the whole planet can enjoy the benefits of economic and social development  when all peoples can freely decide their own future  and when in each of our nations we have broken down the artificial barriers relating to race  religion and all other grounds for discrimination.Unfortunately  this session is being held against a backdrop of economic and political crisis which hardly gives grounds for optimism - at least about the immediate future. This general crisis  which is so deep-rooted and far-reaching in its effects  has tragically affected the countries of the third world  and particularly those of Africa.The recent United Nations surveys of the social situation in the world in 1985 and the world economy in 1986 have indicated that as far as international economic relations are concerned there has been an increase in protectionism and a lade of any genuine transfer of technologies and resources  to developing countries; there has been a breakdown in North-South negotiations  and there has been very severe pressure on commodity prices.The consequences of these policies on the countries of the third world have been growing balance-of-payment deficits and increased indebtedness  bringing most of our countries to the brink of bankruptcy.We have also noted that since the decade which terminated in 1980 a growing number of countries in the third world have been obliged to negotiate with international institutions and conclude agreements which in many cases have led to draconian measures involving substantial or even multiple currency devaluations  almost insupportable budgetary cuts  the elimination of currency subsidies for mass consumption goods  and the removal of protective measures relating to terms of foreign trade and external payments. In brief  there has been a whole range of very painful measures which in many cases have had no lasting effect.These steps  designed to restore basic macro-economic equilibrium  have in many cases had very severe social consequences and have sometimes produced effects which have been very damaging to general development aims.Pour months ago  there was a special session of the General Assembly cm the Critical Economic Situation in Africa  convened at United Nations Headquarters. This was the first time in the history of the Organization that such a session was held to consider the economic problems pertaining to a specific region. It was also the first time that the African continent officially brought its problems before the international community.The special session gave us an opportunity to have a detailed discussion of the breadth and scope of the economic crisis which at present besets the African continent. It also made it possible to discuss appropriate ways of remedying the situation. The session adopted the United Nations Program of Action for Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. That decision symbolizes the firm political support which the international community is giving to Africa as part of the African Priority Program for Economic Recovery 1986-1990  and its commitment to improving the international economic climate in order to help Africa in its adjustment and development efforts.I should like to reiterate that we  the peoples of Africa  are resolved to take every step required  both nationally and internationally  to bring about economic recovery  and growth and development in Africa  and to achieve the long-term development targets laid down in the Lagos Plan of Action.Africa agreed to make all these efforts at a time when the international climate was unfavorable and when multilateral co-operation was at its lowest level.Indeed  there have been substantial losses in its commodity markets because of the deterioration in the terms of trade  and it has been obliged to spend up to 50 per cent of its export earnings to pay the interest on its debts  at a time when public aid for development continues to decrease  Africa thus has become thecontinent of negative transfers  because it is the victim of a growing imbalance which is caused by the continuing unfavorable trade situation.The greatest challenge which must now be faced is the implementation of the above-mentioned United Nations Program of Action. The special session gave rise to an encouraging consensus when it adopted that Program of Action  but the unanimous support for the Program was not immediately accompanied by any specific offer of finance. It therefore is quite clear that the international community must make special efforts if it intends to mobilize and implement the AfricanProgram of Action.The whole international community  the donor countries  international andnon-governmental organizations and United Nations agencies  will all have to act in concert with the African countries  both individually and collectively  in order to mobilize the necessary resources.In order to facilitate follow up in the implementation of these decisions  the Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity (0A0) has already set up a standing steering committee. This committee is to draw up the practical ways and means for the execution of the Program of Action  in consultation with the United Nations system and other multinational and multilateral organizations  or agencies that provide financing. In addition to the standing steering committee  we decided to provide follow-up machinery at the regional and sub-regional levels. The decisions taken in the context of the priority Program can thus be carried out and incorporated in the development plans and the Programs of action adopted at the national level. At this point we should like to appeal to all countries to create similar machinery in order to make it easier to channel the necessary aid to bring Africa out of its economic recession.It is equally important that the international community be aware of the detrimental effects of Africa's external debt which  because of the critical economic and financial situation which prevails in that continent is deserving of special treatment. That is why the 22nd Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  has instructed me to continue my efforts to have an international conference held to deal with that particularly distressing problem. Once again  we shall be relying on the solidarity of the whole international community.As I have just emphasized  the states members of the OAU have committed Africa to a very bold effort for economic recovery in the light of the current crisis. They are fully aware that in order to develop their nations  in order to exploit and to make full use of the tremendous wealth which exists in the continent  it is important to have high caliber human resources. That is why they have stressed the need to implement integrated Programs dealing with pure science and human and social sciences  education and literacy  the cultural industries  handicrafts  the development of tourism  and cultural co-operation.In this connection  it should be recalled that it is since the statement of Monrovia  in July 1979  that the Heads of State and Government of Africa have publicly expressed their desire to place science and technology at the service of development. The priority Program for the economic recovery of Africa clearly stresses the fact that no country has achieved an economic breakthrough without the creation of a minimum basis for science and technology.Africa is aware of the vital nature of what is at stake  namely mastery of both sciences and adopted techniques as well as state of the art technology which are the real key to tomorrow's world. Africa does not wish to and cannot fail in that undertaking. Even now  to indicate its interest in that endeavor  Africa  at the 22nd Summit of the OMJ took the decision to organize the first Congress of African scientists in Brazzaville  in the People's Republic of the Congo  next June.I should like to take this opportunity to invite all institutions which might be interested to become closely associated with this venture.Africa is also aware that a people which creates nothing is doomed to perish and that it is quite correct to assert with the philosopher that ""Time is invention  otherwise it is nothing."" It is precisely to encourage our young people to study science and technology with all the security that provides for the future that the OMJ has decided to institute a prize for scientific renaissance  the Sheikh Anta DIOP prize  which is named after a great African research worker whose role in affirming the cultural identity of Africa was a determining one.In the field of the environment  practically everything has already been said on the deterioration of the natural environment in Africa  its causes  and the remedies required. Here  I should simply like to welcome the efforts of the international community and the valuable assistance it has provided to those African countries which have fallen victims to drought  desertification and other natural catastrophes.Africa  for its part  is determined to achieve food self-sufficiency between now and the year 2000  in accordance with the relevant resolution of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FSO). Therefore  we request massive and decisive support on the part of the international community to enable Africa to ensure its security and autonomy in the natter of food.At a recent meeting in Yamoussoukro In the Cote d'Ivoire  the African Ministers of Agriculture adopted a strategy to bring about food self-sufficiency and defined a consistent agricultural development programs for the next 25 years.What we must do today is to move on from the stage of emergency aid to structural assistance  which will make it possible for in-depth action to be pursued  a sort of action which frees people from the nightmare of famine and poverty.Apart from the economic challenges which it has to face the African continent is also beset by a situation of ongoing war  which has been imposed upon it by the minority racist regime of Pretoria. That problem is a matter of major concern to our Organization.More than a quarter century after this Assembly adopted its Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  in resolution 1514 (XV) of December 1960  Africa is still seeking to free itself from the last bastion of colonialism.The question of Namibia has not yet been resolved despite United Nations resolutions and international pressure. The meetings  held recently in Vienna and New York on this serious problem nevertheless clearly indicate our firm resolve to put an end to the illegal occupation of that Territory  a Territory occupied by a regime which  relying on its strength and on support from outside  defies the international community. We must therefore state  loud and clear  that for us the only sound basis for a final settlement of this problem is Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  and that there can be no room for any sort of diversionary tactics.The problem is essentially one of decolonization and nothing else. The linkage which has been artificially established with the domestic situation in Angola cannot alter this truth.The tense situation that prevails today in South Africa itself is due to the arrogance of the apartheid regime  which continues to defy the international community by maintaining an odious and anachronistic system with complete impunity. It is up to the General Assembly  which has declared the system of apartheid to be a crime against humanity  to shoulder its responsibilities in full.We must act in accordance with our conscience and with the measures we adopt here. I do not believe that in this Hall there are any representatives of any States who support racism. That being the case  if we are all fundamentally anti-racist  what are we waiting for  both individually and collectively  before weabolish this system which is rejected by each and every one of our societies?Those who maintain that the use of force should be prohibited even in the case of those struggling against apartheid are people to whom we would say that there is one minimum requirement: the application  under Chapter VII of the Charter  of global and mandatory sanctions  which would help at least to eradicate apartheidpeacefully if the entire international community were to abide by them. The oppressed people of South Africa and the front-line countries have themselves agreed to suffer the effects of such sanctions if this is the price to be paid for their dignity. Furthermore  have they not said that there is no suffering worse than that which is inflicted upon them by their masters and oppressors in Pretoria?That is why it is urgent for the international community to find definitive solutions to the questions of Namibia and South Africa  while at the same time giving more resolute support to the heroic struggle of these peoples  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the African National Congress (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC)  by contributing substantially to the funds set up for southern Africa  particularly that recently created in the context of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  by effectively implementing the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its recent special session on the question of Namibia  and the special declaration on southern Africa adopted at the eighth summit conference of the non-aligned countries.Africa is also deeply disquieted by the problem of Western Sahara. Here  we should express our gratification at the close co-operation that exists between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Organization of African unity on this matter. I would like to tell Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar that we are quite ready to seek  with him  ways of bringing the two parties to the conflict to a settlement that will safeguard the rights of the Sahraoui people and bring peace and co-operation in the subregion.As regards Chad  there is an urgent need for a sincere and definitive reconciliation among all the inhabitants of Chad so that  without any foreign interference whatsoever  this country may be able to regain its peace  national unity and territorial integrity.I could not conclude my remarks without referring to the on-going tensions in other parts of the world. On the basis of the attachment of African peoples themselves to peace and understanding  may I voice the hope that reason and wisdom will prevail over any other considerations. My country  the People's Republic of the Congo  has made good-neighborliness one of the corner-stones of its foreign policy. It was probably this fact that won for it the votes of all of Africa at the most recent summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity. That is the reason why  wherever conflicts arise  whether they be absurd or justified  we say that there is nothing like negotiation and consultation  for military victories are the most perilous inasmuch as they sometimes incur rancor and are therefore ephemeral.That is why  in the Middle East  we advocate a just and lasting peace  together with mutual respect for the sovereignty of all States in the region  the restoration of those territories that have been taken by force  and the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland.On this burning issue of the present day  I would like to expatiate a little and to recall that it was in December 1972 that the People's Republic of the Congo  learning a lesson from the persistent tension in that region  decided to break off its diplomatic relations with Israel. A year later  following the October war in 1973  the Organization of African Unity decided to break off relations with the Jewish State out of solidarity with the Arab peoples and the struggle of the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).Since that date  the situation has hardly changed; hence the Organization of African Unity has not changed its position. Our support for that just cause is therefore still fully in force. The People's Republic of the Congo  in keeping with its foreign policy and pursuant to the decisions of the OAD  through we reiterates that it will maintain that correct attitude until such time as Israel changes its policies. There can be no possible ambiguity in regard to this matter.In regard to the Gulf conflict  we should like to make an urgent appeal to our Iraqi and Iranian brothers to put an end to an endless war  damaging to their own interests.The same concern leads us to hope that the peace-lowing Afghan and Khmer peoples will very soon recover peace and unity.Nor can we forget that the Korean peninsula is also aspiring to peace  which necessarily involves an open and frank dialog between the two fraternal divided States. The peaceful reunification of Korea remains an essential objective to be achieved.In Central America  we support the initiatives of the countries in the region to bring about an atmosphere of peace and mutual trust guaranteeing peaceful coexistence.Here I should like to reiterate the right of every State freely to choose the regime it prefers without any foreign interference.We have just seen that the world is faced with significant challenges which  in the case of Africa  have become real tragedies. Africa remains convinced that those challenges cannot be met in a world in upheaval  a world which is divided and beset by fear and where inequity prevails.That is why the Organization of African Unity is working for peace  harmony and the establishment of a new international economic order that is more just and more equitable.Africa expects the international community not to remain silent and powerless in the face of such basic and legitimate concerns. It reiterates its solidarity with the rest of the world in the task of restoring to the United Nations the dynamism it requires to carry out and to preserve its noble objectives.Hence our message is one of peace  solidarity and hope."
"31",1521,"COL",41,1986,"First of all  I wish to convey my greetings and congratulations to you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Your vast experience and proven diplomat skill assure us that you will guide our deliberations with intelligence and even-handedness.I also wish to thank and congratulate Ambassador Jaime de Pinies for his endeavors during the fortieth session of the General Assembly.Similarly  I wish to express my support and admiration for the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose report to the Assembly reveals not only his thorough knowledge of international problems but also his faith in multilateral solutions based on the principles of the United Nations.As the head of State of Colombia  I come here to reaffirm my country's confidence in the role of the United Nations in this disturbing period of history and to urge that the serious problems of our region be duly dealt with. My country contributed effectively to the founding of the United Nations and of the inter-American system. Our legal tradition gives us authority to offer our good offices whenever required and also our firm support for the aspirations and hopes of the international community and its representative organizations.As I had occasion to state quite recently  at the General Assembly of the Organization of American states  we have faith in the principles of coexistence regulated by law. Hence our concern about the deterioration of peaceful coexistence in Central America  and hence our readiness to continue with our good offices in the Contadora Group. We are motivated by an undeniable commitment to peace and the desire to avoid a generalization of the conflict situation in that area of our continent.The influence and the prestige of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries will increase only to the extent that it acts dynamically and independently  serving the interests of developing countries  and to the extent that it serves as a democratic and positive link between conflicting Powers. Only thus will it contribute to world detente  to arras control  to the peaceful settlement of conflicts and to the building of an international economic order based on justice and respect for the right of every people to choose freely its own future.One of the factors having the greatest effect on the prospects for progress in our developing countries is foreign debt. The statistics are overwhelming. Many countries suffer mass unemployment  in some cases more than 15 per cent of the labor force  as well as a generalized trend to recession  which is showing few signs of abatement - all this added to a worrisome decrease in international trade.Yesterday  at the forty-first annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank  I referred to the various aspects of the critical situation of indebtedness in several countries of our continent and to the prospects for overcoming the situation. I did the same in October 1985 in letters I addressed to Fidel Castro  President of Cuba  end Aldwin Clausen  President of the World Bank  with regards to the Assembly to be held in Seoul. I referred to the disquieting phenomenon of the flight of capital from Latin America  a region which  because of the problems of foreign debt has become a net exporter of capital and  in those letters  I analyzed the adjustment programs begun under the sponsorship of the IMF.I also referred! to the need to avoid any form of protection ism on the part of the industrialized countries and to provide preferential access to their markets for the commodities  manufactures and services of the developing countries. The specialized agencies of the international system and the United Nations have very clear responsibilities at this time. We must stop the flow of resources from developing to industrialized countries.Similarly  with all due considerations  there should be plans for adjustment programs and restructuring. The burden that this places on debtor countries should not be borne by the poorest classes of society  thus making an already explosive situation more difficult and untenable. In the case of Africa  even though its debt is moderate compared with that of Latin America  its economic capacity is extremely fragile and thus the situation is no less serious.Terrorism and the drug traffic constitute crimes against mankind which put to the test the sturdiest defense mechanisms of our societies. In this forum we have heard condemnations of these crimes  and today  more than ever  when so many innocent lives have been lost in vandalistic attacks  we must denounce such crimes. On this occasion I join in the justified and outraged universal condemnation of these outbursts of barbarism.Colombia is fighting a head-on battle against the production of  trading in and consumption of narcotic drugs. In this heroic struggle magistrates  judges and government officials have died  among then a sinister of justice; and members of the armed forces of the Republic  well-known journalists and ordinary men and women have also sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.Although we have paid an extremely high and painful price  I wish to state in this Assembly that ray country will not waver in its struggle against such barbarous crimes. For this struggle to be successful it is essential that the countries with the highest levels of consumption of these degrading substances put into practice  as is finally being done  co-ordinated programs to penalize and discourage the consumption of and trade in drugs of this type. Here  as well as in other fields of our joint battle against terrorism  it is imperative to have understanding and co-ordination among all civilized nations. Colombia is ready to participate in agreements and action along these lines.The enormity of the sums of money States devote to developing new technologies of annihilation and to manufacturing instruments of death and destruction makes even the strongest spirits fearful. The resources used up in this endeavor could well be devoted to alleviating the sufferings of mankind and speeding its development and progress.Latin America  which seemed to be far removed from the risks of nuclear contamination  must now carefully examine what is happening elsewhere in the world  including the peaceful use of nuclear energy  and must exercise care in its own utilization of such energy.Last year  the world reviewed with justified pride the achievements of theUnited Nations. There had been 40 years of maintaining world peace and strivingtowards development and international justice. More than 60 world leaders camehere on the occasion of that anniversary celebration to renew their confidence in the Organization.We must now look ahead. We are less than 14 years away from the third millenium of our era. War and peace  development  human rights  the rational use of outer space and of the oceans  all these are matters for which the United Nations provides a natural forum for international discussion and for the attainment of effective compromises  through negotiations  in order to move forward.But side by side with those international problems  there are others  seemingly domestic  that call for the solidarity of the international community. I refer to the increasing disparity between those who share in the benefits of civilization and those who are inexorably shut off from them.The poor  the victims of discrimination  the unemployed  peasants who cannot produce what they need  children who perish daily because of hunger and disease that could  without too much effort  be cured  refugees. South African blacks: those are injustices  those are inequalities that become more intolerable with each day on a planet which - and this is true - is able to overcome them.Alone  a way out of such situations cannot be found? together  we can create a better world. Mankind  if it wishes to do so  can alleviate hunger  poverty  disease and ignorance. The means exist. The technology exists. However  resolve is lacking.If that were forthcoming  we would have a world Organization devoted to building a more just society  and that enhanced society would better serve the world Organization.Hops must once again arise and inspire the actions of the international community. The Organization must adapt to the vision of the different world for which we hope  a world vastly different from the world of the founders at San Francisco. In order to do this  action is needed in at least four areas.The United Nations must establish a limited list of priorities and promote and administer them with the best possible expertise and effectiveness.The Secretary-General  who acts on behalf of the large  the medium-sized and the small States alike  must have the necessary instruments and support to carry out his delicate task to the full.The peoples of the United Nations must have greater access to our deliberations and greater responsibility in program implementation.The financial costs of the Organization  once its purposes have been restated  must be more generously borne by all Members  including the poorest. That is the only way in which we can prove our commitment.So far we have managed to avoid another world conflagration. The awareness of poverty and inequality must lead to their elimination with the same vigor with which we have repudiated war. This is the ideal of our time: to wage war against injustice and inequality. If we make up our minds to do so  it will take us less than 40 years  and we will have consolidated the peace.Today  I would ask the international community to reaffirm its commitment to the total eradication of poverty. Among the many threats confronting our world  none has been as constant as poverty. The so-called progress made over the 41 years of the United Nations can be measured in terms of the number of people who continue to live in utter poverty. In recent years that number has grown significantly  and today it includes one fourth of mankind. No other problem requires swifter or more urgent action. I shall return to this point in greater detail later in my statement. When I assumed the presidency of the Republic of Colombia last August? I invited several Heads of State and representatives of friendly Governments present in my country to join in an all-out battle against utter poverty  which is the root cause of so many political  social and economic ills.At that time  I voiced some ideas that I should like to repeat here today. Isaid:""Extreme poverty cannot be accepted as the inevitable consequence of natural differences between men  nor can it be accepted as a characteristic of still-backward societies beset by want. I am convinced that for those who will in the future have the responsibility of governing  the major challenge will be to overcome the barrier poverty has set up before us."" The maintenance of harmony and the achievement of peace have a special significance in each country  one that can be identified only with the constant and determined search for social justice. Yesterday  before the Assembly of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund  I stated that problems of the developing countries are not only extremely serious but that they have become even worse because of the weaknesses of the present international economic situation.Here  before this Assembly  I do not wish to conceal the fact that in my own country  Colombia  despite efforts to achieve development and the wellbeing of the people  we are at present confronting a tragic reality with regard to poverty. Of the population of Colombia  25% - in other words  6.5 million people - are living in abject poverty. Overt unemployment and underemployment affect more than one third of the economically active population.Faced with that situation  ray Government has taken urgent measures. It has sent to Congress bills to introduce prompt and effective reforms in the structures of the agrarian and urban economies. It has ordered immediate action in programs for improving drinking water supplies  housing  health and nutrition  and it is preparing to implement an emergency employment plan aimed at drawing up a set of programs and projects for the elimination of what is classified as abject poverty.I appeal to the countries of Latin America  and to the whole world  as well as to international organizations  to take united action against this degrading social scourge  and to that end we hope we can continue to enjoy the support of the United Nations Development program.I therefore wish to ask the Secretary-General to convene the responsible officials of all the relevant agencies of the United Nations system to establish the bases of a program for immediate action against abject poverty  with the particular aim of submitting it to the Governments of Latin America and the Caribbean. Such action would help create the impetus and the means to enable us to build a new society in our countries in which everyone can be sure of a minimum level of well-being.The results will come about more quickly and will be more substantial if that action goes hand in hand with an emergency financing program with the participation of the industrialized countries and the international agencies.We know very well that the primary responsibility rests with each of our countries  and we have assumed that responsibility  calling for support and sacrifices from all social sectors  especially those at the higher income levels. But we are also aware that the situation we face makes it necessary to have the co-operation of the industrialized countries. This task is one of unknown dimensions and calls for united decision-making and efforts.Colombia offers to host a meeting of all the countries of the region  the industrialized countries and the developing countries which may wish to make proposals and exchange information about useful experience in the great battle of our civilization against abject poverty.I ask you  Mr. President  and all representatives to accept the gratitude and commitment of a Colombian  a South American  who hopes to see the whole continent a beacon of peace  well-being and freedom for the human race."
"32",1562,"COM",41,1986," Sir  your unanimous election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-first session is a tribute not only to your outstanding qualities as a diplomat but to your country  Bangladesh  with which my country  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  enjoys fraternal and friendly relations. I should like to take this opportunity  on behalf of my delegation  to convey to you our warmest congratulations and to wish you every success in the performance of your task. I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  for the ability and dedication with which he served as President of our previous session.I also take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his efforts and constant dedication in the service of the United Nations. We are pleased at his quick recovery from his recent illness and we wish him the best of good health and strength for the continuation of his difficult task.As we gather once again in this Assembly to evaluate  as is customary  the work done by our Organization  we must note that since last year's historic session  at which we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the world has remained plagued by many hotbeds of tension. International relations  both political and economic  have deteriorated further  and the victims of this desperate situation are still the same - that is  the weakest and poorest nations.Our Organization must thus continue to play its crucial and extremely important role in the world. But now  it has become the major target  subject to attacks from all sides  of those who wish to prevent it from lending a more attentive ear to the problems of third world countries. Attempts have thus been made to attempt to minimize and restrict its role by attacking the basic principles of multilateralism. It is clear that such a state of affairs is not likely to foster a climate of detente in international relations.The numerous hotbeds of tension that disrupt our world continue to be of the greatest concern to the international community. Thus  in the Middle East  the situation has barely changed. Motivated by annexationist and expansionist designs  the Zionist entity refuses to evacuate occupied Arab territories  showing obstinate disdain for the relevant resolutions of the Organization.Moreover  Jewish settlements  far from being"" reduced in number  are proliferating in the occupied territories  as ever accompanied by harsh repression against the Arab and Palestinian population  with serious violations of humanrights and dignity.As we have always said  there cannot be a just and lasting peace in the MiddleEast as long as the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are not acknowledged  guaranteed and effectively exercised.Hence my country unreservedly supports the idea of organizing an international conference on peace in the Middle East  in which all the parties concerned wouldparticipate  including  of course  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PIO)  the sole legitimate and authentic representative of the Palestinian people.The situation in Lebanon  once the land of peace  a junction between East and West  remains alarming despite the ray of hope generated by the promising prospect of national reconciliation.We are deeply concerned by the presence of foreign forces which continue illegally to occupy that country  thereby flouting its full right to exercise full sovereignty over its national territory. It is time that the Lebanese people  which only wish to live in peace and security  regained its dignity and its right to exist in national harmony with solidarity restored among its people.The fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq has cost the colossal sum of more than 3500 billion. Who can possibly benefit from this tragedy? Certainly not the Iranian and'Iraqi peoples  who mourn the loss of more than a million lives so far.It is thus with deep sadness that ray country witnesses the continuation of this absurd and useless war. We welcome the repeated offers of a cease-fire made by the Iraqi Government and we reiterate our appeal to the Iranian Government to respond favorably to those offers.Despite the glimmer of hope represented by the partial withdrawal of foreignoccupation troops  war still rages in Afghanistan  and the drain on that country'svital forces continues. This situation is a serious threat to peace and securityin that region  particularly by reason of the constant violations of the air space of neighboring countries.I should like to reaffirm once again our support of our brothers  the Afghanpeople  and to call for the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of our Organization.In regard to Kampuchea  we can only express our deep disappointment that General Assembly decisions demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of that country are still being disregarded.The situation in the Korean peninsula remains a stalemate  despite the stated willingness of the leaders of those two States to arrive at a peaceful solution allowing the reunification of their homeland. Hence we appeal to the two parties to continue in their quest for a just and lasting solution  for a united Korea would provide a guarantee of peace and stability for the region.Other sources of tension continue to feed the flames in Africa. The situation in southern Africa remains explosive and continues to be of the greatest concern  not only to the African continent but also to the whole international community.My country  dedicated to the principles of peace  justice and equality among people  unreservedly condemns the inhuman system of apartheid and urgently appeals to the leaders of South Africa to put an end immediately to that practice of human subjugation.Moreover  we deplore the fact that  to date  the pertinent resolutions adopted by our Organization for the independence of Namibia have not been implemented. We remain convinced that only the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will make possible a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the Namibianquestion.As regards the Western Sahara  we welcome the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to finding a just and lasting solution to this question. We support this welcome initiative  and would urge- him to continue these efforts untilpeace is restored to that region.My country  like all the other coastal States of the Indian Ocean  is still concerned by the increasing foreign military presence in that area. This state of affairs creates a climate of tension that threatens peace and security in that part of the world.We unreservedly support the idea of making that region a zone of peace pursuant to our Organization's Declaration in resolution 2832 (XXVI) and reiterate our desire that the International Conference for this purpose be convened in Colombo.Outlined  the international economic situation is little better than the political situation that I have just outlined. It is characterized by a growing imbalance to the detriment of developing countries  especially the weakest of them  commonly called the least developed countries. Even though there has been a clear recovery in the rich countries of the North  the situation of the poor countries of the South has worsened  along with a negative growth rate  unacceptable indebtedness and galloping inflation  not to mention unemployment and hunger.My country  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  which is one of the least developed countries  has been especially hard hit by the harmful effects of this crisis owing to the fact that it is an island country with structural problems that seriously impede its development. These include our country's isolation from major avenues of international communication  the dispersed nature of our national territory and consequent difficulties in organizing and equipping our country  the small size of the domestic market and lack of adequate infrastructures.Even though our Government has made considerable efforts in this sphere and many projects are under way or have been completed  a lot remains to be done. That is why  in spite of the progress we achieved in recent years - thanks to the plans put into operation by our Government and the sacrifices made by our people  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros continues to face an alarming financial situation. In spite of the implementation of unprecedented recovery measures  our country still faces problems caused by the excessive increase in interest rates andunfavorable lending terms  which hinder our investment Programs. It is obvious that such a situation jeopardizes economic growth and causes increased unemployment.Furthermore  the increase in the public debt of more than 300 per cent in the past three years has wiped out the effects of previous efforts  compelling the Government to devote more than one third of our export to discharging the State's commitments to creditors. This situation seriously compromises the efforts at social and economic recovery made by the Government at a time when official development assistance is becoming increasingly scarce.We believe that renegotiation of debts  incurred sometimes on very unfavorable terms  is one of the most appropriate ways of fostering the rapid and sustained growth of the national economy. In this connection  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  like the other States members of the Organization of African unity (OAU)  calls for the convening of an international conference on African indebtedness.Similarly  once again this year I wish to address an appeal from this rostrum  to the international community for increased assistance to my country  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 40/223.One of the Comorian Government's foreign policy priorities is the promotion of regional co-operation and the strengthening of our relations with all neighboring countries. This policy is based on a philosophy rooted in the principles of peace  friendship and mutual respect inscribed in the Charter of our Organization and the charter of the Organization of African Unity.That is why immediately following our national independence the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  having become a fully-fledged member of the major regional and international organizations  made every effort to establish political  diplomatic and economic relations  both multilateral and bilateral  with most of the neighboring countries. Thus  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros isamong the founding members of the Preferential Exchange Zone  an economic community which includes more than 15 countries in southern and eastern Africa.More recently  the Comorian Government joined the Indian Ocean Commission  which is made up of the islands of that subregion and of which my country is this year's president. This Commission  whose major objectives are to promote the economic development of its member states by the pooling of financial and human resources and ensure a more rational use of their potential  also has the task of ensuring preservation of their cultural heritage  without in any way changing or replacing the traditional bilateral bonds.Thus  like the Commission  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros maintains its own relations with all the States in the subregion on the basis of solidarity  friendship and complementarity.I cannot conclude my statement without referring briefly - since we have the opportunity to do so - to a question that is constantly before our Assembly and is of crucial importance to the people and Government of the Comoros: the question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte. Of course  this problem is not exclusively Comorian since in many respects it is of concern to the African continent and  for reasons of right and justice  to the entire international community.Although there has been some slight development this year  with the reception in Paris by the French Prime Minister  Mr. Jacques Chirac  of a delegation from the OAU ad hoc Committee of Seven entrusted with dealing with this question  the problem still remains. Following that Paris meeting and talks between the French Prime Minister and Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Anderemane  President of the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros  the French Government decided not to hold a referendum in. Mayotte. Obviously  it was with great interest that the people and Government of the Comoros noted that decision  which we feel supports our position.It will be recalled that our Organization  in its resolution 31/4  of 21 October 1976  and subsequent resolutions  condemned and categorically rejected any referendum on the international legal status quo of the island organized on Comorian territory by France  it being understood that the referendum on self-determination organized in the Comoros on 22 December 1974 remained the only valid one for the whole archipelago.In spite of the positive aspect of that denunciation  the status quo persists in Mayotte  and hence the problem  too  remains. This is a question of justice  and the people and the Government of the Comoros  knowing the justice of their causes  intend to pursue their claims with determination. For its part  the international community has a duty  in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the united Nations  to lend its total support until the triumph of that just cause.I wish once again solemnly to reaffirm the profound commitment of the people and the Government of the Comoros to the Charter ideals of peace  justice and equality. For us  that Organization is art irreplaceable instrument in maintaining a balance in international relations  if the United Nations is to recover its original vocation and to play its full role  each of its Members must scrupulously respect its fundamental principles."
"33",1601,"CPV",41,1986,"Sir  it is with great satisfaction that we address to the President our congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-first session  His personal qualities as a leader and his diplomatic experience are a guarantee that the serious problems at present confronting our Organization will be properly dealt with so that we shall be enabled to find solutions and thereby to promote the establishment of international confidence.We should like also to express our appreciation for the work carried out during the fortieth session  particularly during the celebrations of the anniversary of the United Nations  and to pay a tribute to the previous president  Mr. Jaime de Pinies. His presidency made a major contribution to the improvement of the Organization's image.We should like also particularly to congratulate the Secretary-General/ Mr. Javier Peres de Cue liar  for the invaluable contribution and laudable efforts which he has made in the discharge of his duties. Through his wealth of experience  his personal devotion and his enlightened view of our collective problems  the five years of his term of office have been very enriching from the point of view of analyzing and identifying the underlying causes of the difficulties which beset present international institutions and have also made a major contribution to cushioning the impact of the crisis which  as we know  is the fate of all at the present time. Cape Verde greatly appreciated his tenacity and calmness in the difficult hours which the international community has lived through during this time  as well as his resolute courage when the international situation required it.Eleven years ago the Republic of Cape Verde became a member of the great family of the united Nations  its desire being to make a modest contribution to the building of a world of peace  progress and social justice. Since then the international situation has been steadily deteriorating. Reasons for optimism and confidence have rarely proved to be well founded. Conflicts and disputes continue in various parts of the world. Growing rivalries between the major Powers  particularly in the nuclear field  have led to an increased arms race at unprecedented levels. Imbalances and inequalities between rich and poor nations have become accentuated  whereas despair and poverty have been growing among developing countries  essentially because of the fact that an international economic system which is no longer in step with the realities of the present day world has been perpetuated. These negative phenomena  which seriously threaten international peace and security just when our Organization was last year celebrating its fortieth anniversary  have been mentioned repeatedly by Heads of State and Government.The leaders present on this occasion  conveying the aspirations and concerns of their respective peoples  have emphasized the risks and dangers that beset mankind and have appealed to us to concert our efforts in the urgent task of building peace and co-operation for development  and to work together for the democratization of international relations. We note with deep concern that tension and international crises continue to be constant features of our daily life  with serious implications for mankind.Cape Verde reiterates its full support for the fundamental principle? that should underlie international relations as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Charter of the Organization of African Unity  as well as in the practice of the non-aligned countries. Furthermore  we reiterate the ethic underlying our foreign policy in seeking solutions which will lead to peace and development. We are certain that only confidence and mutual respect can create a sound and lasting basis for dialog and international co-operation.The negative trends that are today a feature of the relations between States  and which are to be seen in practically all conflicts and instances of tension and instability in the world  are reflected in the activities of this Organization  which came into being 41 years ago on the basis of the sovereign equality of States  an Organization dedicated to building peace and promoting co-operation and development among peoples.Like many countries  the Republic of Cape Verde has in the general debate in the last two years voiced its concern over the enormous difficulties confronting this Organization and its specialized agencies in performing their duties and in pursuit of the noble objectives inscribed in their charters.Like the overwhelming authority of Member states we have always defended the view that there is no alternative to the United Nations. The interdependence of today's world and the multiplicity and complexity of international life at this time require global solutions which transcend frontiers and which can be envisaged only in a universal framework such as that provided by the United Nations  where the legitimate interests of all countries  great and small  rich and poor  are duly taken into account.Any attempt to divert international public opinion  which is now focused on collective issues  from the institutionalized multilateral framework of the United Nations  would no doubt satisfy those interests that are prompted by the need to bring about a spirit of national affirmation and create and pave the way for the unilateral imposition of solutions on other countries  but it could also lead - and in fact has led - to a weakening of international institutions as a suitable framework for understanding the problems affecting most States.The problems of world peace and security and of co-operation to further development and human rights are problems which  because of their global nature  affect all corners and peoples of the earth. That is why attempts to find solutions to them are part of a multilateral  stable and proper framework in which all peoples of the world are duly represented.The need for the United Nations as the preferred  if not the sole  forum for finding solutions to our collective problems is becoming particularly acute in the present situation  where developing countries  including Cape Verde  are being confronted by gloomy prospects  particularly in the socio-economic field. If we were all desirous - as many speaking from this rostrum have affirmed themselves to be - of saving the world from catastrophe  of helping to raise the level of mankind and human dignity  thus creating a climate of peace and prosperity for one and all.then all of us  and principally those countries that bear major international responsibility  should give practical effect to their commitment to fulfill the tasks of the united Nations  as well as their firm adherence to its purposes and principles. Hitherto  unfortunately  despite the constructive statements made during the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  very little has been done to eliminate the crisis and restore confidence in the United Nations system.On the contrary  that confidence has been seriously shaken by the financial crisis of the Organization. The financial difficulties are above all  as we know  a reflection of political positions which work to deny the United Nations its role as an institutional framework for dialog on the major international issues of the present day  on the basis of the sovereign equality of States. Thus  if the financial crisis were to be resolved  this would undoubtedly help to resolve the institutional crisis that now besets the United Nations. The institutional crisis  in its turn  cannot be resolved without the political will of all countries. Our common destiny requires us to make national sacrifices in this way.There is no doubt that a great deal could be done towards streamlining the work of the United Nations in order to improve its administrative and financial effectiveness. The creation of the Group of 18 last year  pursuant to a unanimous decision of this Assembly  was dictated by the need to improve the financial and administrative activities of the Organization. He hope the work of the Group will help to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization. The Assembly must pay great attention to the recommendations of the Group and that should lead to decisions that will wake for a stronger United Nations  one which is more confident and better equipped to pursue its objectives.we should like to believe that today we cannot combine the ideals of peace with obsessive preparation for war. One cannot invoke liberation  justice or progress simply in order to disguise hegemonic trends or claims.  Respect for the principles and norms governing international relations should not be made subordinate to national interests or become lost in ambiguous interpretations. Yet  in flagrant violation of such norms and principles  tensions are mounting and threats to the world's security multiply because of the stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the extension of the arms race into new areas. One display of strength leads to another  in violation of the sovereignty  integrity and political independence of States  and creates a climate of instability and insecurity  particularly among the developing countries. Unprecedented acts of aggression  in total disregard of the norms of international law  are being undertaken under various pretexts against sovereign States Members of the Organization.He cannot let pass this opportunity to express our rejection of the escalation of international terrorism in all its forms  including State terrorism  which  with its accompaniment of innocent victims  is affecting international relations as a whole. The causes of that phenomenon deserve greater attention from all Member States  since recourse to terrorism is all-too-often the result of the injustice  poverty and inequalities that prevail in today's world. It is essential that action be taken to eliminate that scourge by adopting measures and initiatives that take into account the need to eliminate its underlying causes.On the other hand  we cannot tolerate the use or threat of force against sovereign countries  particularly small ones. The use of force in international relations contributes to lack of respect for and weakening of the United Nations. A world in which the law of the strongest prevails is contrary to the concept of a civilized world guided by humanitarian ideals.This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when events in the southern part of Africa are once again drawing attention to the resistance that the forces of apartheid  racial discrimination and colonial tyranny are offering to those working for change in that part of the continent. The possibilities of anexplosion of violence  with unpredictable consequences for the continent as a whole  and for the world  are increasing.Once again  apartheid stands exposed before the international community as an abhorrent system of oppression that is historically and universally condemned  particularly in a world like our own  struggling for the ideals of peace  equality  social justice and progress  and particularly on a continent that stands to gain so much from peaceful coexistence and constructive co-operation among its peoples and States.Owing to the complex interests involved  current events in that strategic region deserve the full attention of the whole of the international community  for nothing is more urgent than that all turn their efforts and their devotion towards preserving the region from a bloody conflagration.The acts of aggression being carried out against neighboring countries and the important aid being given to puppet units of armed bandits intended to destabilize the Governments of legally constituted sovereign countries  as well as the constant defiance of the norms and principles of international law that govern relations among States  all demonstrate the inability of the present Pretoria regime to enter onto the path of political realism and to accept the idea of the total dismantling of apartheid as the only way to defend the genuine interests of South African society as a whole.Acts of military aggression  especially those aimed at disrupting socio-economic activities  carried out against the front-line countries  particularly against the People's Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique  are designed not only to destabilize those sovereign countries but also to stifle the economy of the entire region.We should like to express here our serious concern at the increase in the military threats along the southern border of Angola  evidenced by the concentration of South African troops in that region  and following upon the substantial external aid given to the armed bandits of 0N1TA in the form of sophisticated weaponry.We have also witnessed an intensification of the undeclared war being waged against Mozambique which  in conjunction with natural disasters  has increased the problems confronting that sister State.We consider that the whole of the international community has a duty to help the Republic of Angola and the Republic of Mozambique in their struggle to resist aggression and the attempts at destabilization of which they are victims.The critical situation in South Africa has quite rightly been the rocus of the concerns of all countries Members of the Organization. Confronted with an imminent catastrophe that would have unforeseeable repercussions on international peace and security  it is the duty o1 the international community  and particularly of the States Members of the United Nations  in the performance of their collective responsibilities and taking into account the recommendations of the second International Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa recently held in Paris  to adopt appropriate measures to avoid the spread of destruction  suffering  anxiety  death and poverty in southern Africa and to safeguard the opportunities to achieve a negotiated solution to the conflict.The first step towards such a negotiated solution must be the liberation of Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners  recognition by those in power of of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other militant democratic forces and the initiation of serious negotiation among the parties on the future of South Africa.This session of the General Assembly can be of major importance and of historic import if its deliberations can generate measures that can bring the South African regime to the negotiating table. In this connection  and mindful of the relevant resolutions and decisions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of the recent summit meeting of countries of the Non-Aligned Movement  efforts must be made to moderate the adjustments and sacrifices being made by certain countries  either under duress or as a consequence of their application of recommended sanctions  particularly those countries whose territory and population are the targets of military aggression and economic reprisal by the South African regime.In this connection we are pleased at the recent proposal made by the non-aligned countries for the creation of a fund to assist in resisting invasion  colonialism and apartheid  the main purpose of which would be to demonstrate solidarity with the front-line States and the liberation movements in South Africa and Namibia.The situation in Namibia demands our full attention because here  in the present-day international context  we are now witnessing a kind of relegation of the Namibian question to the background  as if the solution of that problem were dependent upon the overall solution of the conflict in southern Africa. We hope that the recent special session of the General Assembly on Namibia will not only breathe fresh life into the manner in which that question has been dealt with but  further  that it will demonstrate that the consistent implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) will prove to be an important contribution to reaching a speedy comprehensive solution in the region.As for the Western Sahara  the recent negotiations held in New York between the parties concerned  under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General  have given us grounds for a certain optimism with regard to the possibility of anegotiated settlement of the conflict. We are convinced that continuing such contacts and negotiations is the only way the conflict can ultimately be resolved  and it is for that reason that we have always  in so far as possible  encouraged those involved in that conflict to seek reconciliation through dialog and respect for the sacred rights of peoples to self-determination and independence  in keeping with the relevant resolutions of international bodies on the question.Where Chad is concerned  we reiterate our full support for the actions and initiatives taken by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to bring about national reconciliation  and we continue to hope that the pressing need for peace of the martyred people of that country will be fulfilled. That is why we encourage every initiative in the African framework to bring about a lasting peace with respect for the country's independence and territorial integrity  free of outside interference.With regard to the Middle East  the continuing deterioration of the situation as well as the complexities with which is fraught deserve our Organization's particular attention so that adequate solutions to the conflict can be found. Increased support for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  would be an important step towards securing that people's inalienable rights.In the hope that a just and comprehensive soleUon will be found to the problem of the Middle East  whose acuteness is becoming more and more evident  we cannot but express our support for the urgent need to convene the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties to the Israeli-Arab conflict  pursuant to the Geneva Declaration and resolution 38/58 C  of 13 December 1983 of the General Assembly.We profoundly regret the crisis in Lebanon attended with heavy loss of life. We pay a heartfelt tribute to the soldiers of peace who have lost their lives in performing the noble duty of preserving peace in the service of the United Nations. Their sacrifice has not been in vain. Their contribution to peace will not be forgotten.In the Gulf area  the war between the fraternal peoples of Iran and Iraq continues to cause untold suffering. We once again urgently appeal to the belligerent parties to put an end to this fratricidal conflict  which has caused such irreparable losses in human life and material damages.The situation in Central America continues to deteriorate and is a matter of grave concern to the international community  particularly the question of Nicaragua  a country which  in keeping with the principles of good-neighborliness between nations  should be able to enjoy the right to choose freely its own political  economic and social system in the interest of its people  without any interference  subversion or threat from outside. The Republic of Cape Verde supports and encourages the efforts of the Contadora Group and the Support Group to bring about peace and stability to that part of the world.In South-East Asia  efforts should be made to eliminate sources of tension and preserve the principles of respect for sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the States in that area  including Kampuchea.With regard to ""the situation in Korea  we are convinced that dialog and co-operation between the parties concerned is one of the essential prerequisites for the peaceful reunification of the Korean people.The initiatives of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to reach a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan should be encouraged and pursued in order to promote a political solution to the conflict that respects the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and the right of the Afghan people to decide their own destiny without any foreign interference.The people of East Timor  the victims of genocide waged against them by foreign forces illegally occupying their territory  have for more than a decade been waging a struggle of resistance the noble purpose of which is to recover their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. These aspirations of the Maubere people  against whom an attempt to reduce to silence has been made  deserve greater attention on the part of the Organization to find a just solution to the question  thus preserving its credibility.We wish to appeal to the international community and  in particular  to Portugal  the administering Power of that Territory  as well as to the Secretary-General  to persist ii their efforts in light of the fact that the most elementary rules of justice make it our bounden duty to continue to mobilize every possible resource in order to create the necessary conditions for the free exercise by the Maubere people of their fundamental rights.Initiatives to bring about disarmament are of major importance in the present situation. Not only do they contribute to reducing international tension  mainly among the super-Powers  but they can at the same time pave the way to aeration in the development of the underdeveloped countries by making use of the tremendous economic  human and technological resources that up to now have been devoted to the industry of war. For the developing countries in general and for Africa in particular  peace and disarmament is not merely a question of survival; their economic and social development depend on it.The military presence of foreign countries has been confirmed in the Indian Ocean  despite General Assembly resolutions  in particular resolution 2832 (XXVI) of 16 December 1971  in which the Indian Ocean was declared as a zone of peace. Like other speakers we believe it is necessary to take the appropriate steps in order to demilitarize and denuclearize this part of the world and to turn it into an area of peace and co-operation.At a time when there is a trend towards the geographical proliferation of nuclear weapons  we believe that the experience gained in the Indian Ocean bears eloquent testimony to the need to avoid similar situations in the future.Here we wish to refer specifically to the South-Atlantic  a region with its own identity in which the African and Latin American countries comprising it have particular responsibilities and interests that must be safeguarded. We believe that the international community should make concerted efforts to preserve this region as an area of peace and co-operation  remote from international conflicts  thus making a valuable contribution to promoting universal peace. Poverty  famine  malnutrition and sickness threaten the peoples in the developing countries  thus creating an additional threat to the maintenance of international peace and security. While this situation can be attributed to negative internal factors  fundamentally it is the result of the injustice and the imbalance which have been created and furthered by the present international economic situation.In addition to the negative effects of international economic relations on the economies of develop!- g countries  there are the inequalities in financial flows. Liquid transfers from the developing countries to the developed countries have reached alarming levels - $31 billion in 1985  according to a United Nations survey - whereas financial flows in the opposite direction  including public aid for development  have continued to fall off in absolute and real terms.The reduction in public aid for development has increased difficulties inthese countries. For many years now capital flows on Favorable terms havediminished  and the target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for public aid to development inthe international development strategy for the third decade is far from having been achieved.The solution of the economic problems of the developing countries is complementary to resolving the problems of the developed countries. Thus it is in the common interest to strengthen co-operation for development and to introduce a more just new international economic order. In this process  South-South co-operation can play an important part and contribute to creating collective autonomy for the developing countries.Africa  which has the largest number of least developed countries  has been the continent most affected by the present international economic crisis. This situation has been further aggravated by the disastrous effects of endemic drought and progressive desert creep. In order to confront these tremendous difficulties the affected African countries have mobilized their resources in an effort whose success will depend essentially on the size and the promptness of international oo-operation  mainly that which binds them to the developed countries.Cape Verde is situated in one of the most arid and inhospitable parts of the earth - the Sahel - and as part of the group of least developed countries it has been undertaking an arduous struggle for its economic and social development. We still continue to wage the struggle we started 11 years ago when we gained independence. It is aimed at restoring balance in the ecosystem to combat the effects of drought and desertification and to establish the foundations for the harmonious social and economic development of the country. Experience has indicated that  while the struggle for development requires popular participation and a national effort  this struggle is an important component in international solidarity. The Government of Cape Verde very much appreciates the assistance it continues to receive from its development partners. We have been able to make maximum use of this assistance  thus making a significant contribution to solving our economic problems.The problems besetting mankind are numerous and varied. Successive crises and natural calamities recur-  and conflicts persist and proliferate year after year. That is the conclusion reached by statesmen and leaders from all parts of the world who have spoken from this rostrum. In order to describe more accurately and to find a better solution to the various problems confronting us  new ideas have been put forward and suggestions and proposals have been made. However  we have not been able to observe any tangible results. In order to solve the problems related to development  peace  social justice  progress and human dignity  ideas and proposals are not enough. Political will  a vision of the future  a spirit of solidarity among peoples and decisive steps towards international co-operation for development are essential.We have every hope that  as we approach the next century  bold decisions will be taken in order to achieve these objectives. We are certain that reason and human solidarity will prevail."
"34",1646,"CRI",41,1986," I should like to extend my best wishes to the representatives of sovereign states Members of this unparalleled forum where we express our thoughts and hopes. I express to you  Mr. President  my pleasure that you should have been chosen to preside over the General Assembly during this International Year of Peace  for you add luster to the international community.I come from a nation without weapons. Our children have never seen a tank and cannot recognize an armed helicopter  a ship of war  or even a gun. Parents and grandparents tell stories to the young of the peculiar architecture of some schools that  so many years ago  served as fortresses.I come from a small nation that has enjoyed 100 years of democracy. None of my country's children  men or women knows oppression. There is not a single Costa Rican in exile. Mine is a nation of liberty.I come from a land that in a few short years has provided refuge for more than 250 000 foreigners. Men  women and children have come to our soil  fleeing from tyrannies  fleeing from horizons of hopeless misery  fleeing from violence among brothers  to seek a refuge in the liberty and peace that are Costa Rica's. Theseforeigners make up 10 per cent of our nation's population and are  in the majority  Nicaraguans.I come from a nation that  as is true of many here  confronts grave problems. Our problems range from the poverty suffered by a number of our citizens to the ominous threats to the peace we hold so dear. We wish to defeat that poverty and to preserve that peace.I come from a region of the world that is a mosaic of contrasts. Inequalities abound among the five countries of the Central American isthmus and among the peoples who inhabit it. There are in these lands peoples who may freely elect their governments  and others who cannot; there are lands in which human rights are upheld  others where they are violated daily; there are lands where violence is rife in the countryside and in cities. Others where peaceful coexistence is exemplary. Together with thousands and thousands of illiterates  there- live  among its men and women  musicians and artists who honor humanity  poets and sculptors who transcend frontiers with their artistic expressions. There are dictators who exceeded the bounds of cruelty throughout the decades of sombre history. These are the lands of Central America  among them Costa Rica  lands of wealth for the few  of pain for the many  but of hope for all.I come from the oldest democracy in Spanish America. I come forth with the joyous contentment of a nation that sees democracy with justice reign supreme throughout its area as the only hope for peace for the Americas. We rejoice in the knowledge that so many sister States have recovered their political liberties. We hope to forget soon the suffering that each despotic and autocratic experiment in our America brings in its wake.We deplore the fact that the scenario of cruelty  of useless indebtedness  of rampant corruption and the systematic desecration of human rights unfolds even today in some of our American lands. That is why when I recently took over the Presidency of my country  we formed an alliance between liberty and democracy. Isaid then that  neither economically nor politically would Costa Rica ever serve as an ally of governments who oppress their people. I affirmed then  and I reiterate today  that to embark on the road to peace in the Americas and the Caribbean  the fear of liberty must be overcome. Liberty and democracy for development  liberty and democracy for justice  liberty and democracy for peace.To this forum I bring a message from my people. Let us talk about peace in Central America  assailed by the violence that persists in some sister States and by the threat of war in others.Eminent persons have for decades predicted that the road to justice can only be found in freedom and democracy. Dictatorship  however  has cast a lengthy shadow over the region. As the light of liberty began to shine it showed clearly what that shadow had meant to many countries: years and years of violations of human rights  and insensitivity to the problems of the humble  and their wrongful exploitation by unmerciful rulers.The democratic awakening of Central America is not easy and is plagued with obstacles. Ir some countries  the military  accustomed to dictatorships  appear to to dog  in a sinister way  the hesitant first steps of Governments elected by their people. In other cases  the deep mistrust of brothers and sisters  springing from the same land  mushrooms into guerrilla warfare. The call to an internal reconciliation through democratic means does not appear  for the time being  to be producing tangible effects. Brothers continue to kill brothers; Central American blood continues to be drained.The problems described thus far appear overwhelming. But there is more. The heroic struggle for freedom by the people of Nicaragua culminating in the overthrow of the tyrant Somoza has followed a political path that does not conform to thedesires of its people for liberty  nor to their hopes for a full and vigorous democracy  which so many countries had fully supported earlier in their fightagainst dictatorship.Such a turn of events  neither desired nor anticipated  has transformed Central America into yet another stage for East-West confrontation. There is no respite from the path chosen by the ""comandantes"" who betrayed a revolution destined to give democracy to generations who only knew oppression. That is no respite for a people  frustrated and disappointed  who have returned to civil war. There is no respite for neighboring lands  who feel the threat from a new dogmatic totalitarianism and who suffer now the consequences of a border rife with anguish and disenchantment.Latin America  tired of futile violence and grieved by decades of oppression  warned that the dawning of a new age of liberty for the American Continent was overshadowed by the conflict between the East and the West as a consequence of thepath taken by Nicaragua.There then emerged an unprecedented diplomatic initiative: the Contadora Group. The objective pursued by Mexico  Colombia  Panama and Venezuela earned the respect and support of the whole world and  of course  that of Costa Rica. The aim was none other than to provide a forum to help Central American States to strengthen their democracies and freedoms. It was created as a forum to seek the internal reconciliation of people locked in armed struggle  and to guarantee  by means of democracy  the immediate end to the incipient conflict between East and West. It was created as a forum to facilitate world understanding of the need for preferential economic treatment for Central America. It was created as a forum to accelerate the economic development of our nations and to mitigate the reservoir of ill feeling built up during the dictatorships.The Contadora Group was then joined by the Support Croup  including the democratic Governments of Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay. The whole of Latin America wished to unite and revive Bolivar's clarion call for liberty. Contadora transformed itself into the vanguard of a Latin America that wished to march united towards liberty and in favor of political democracy for all its peoples  ""no more dictators  whether of the left or the right""  proclaimed the banner of peace held by Contadora.The Government of Nicaragua has not listened to history's message of liberty. The Government of Nicaragua has not accepted the fraternal hand extended by Contadora. Instead it has utilized this forum for liberty to gain time and consolidate a military and totalitarian State in its territory.Contadora is not dead. Costa Rica will continue to support its efforts as long as a whisper of hope exists. We desire a peaceful solution and we appeal to the sovereignty of reason. There is a tradition of liberties which beckons us to serve as responsible and conscientious advocates. Yet if we turn our backs on this tradition  the tragedy of war will overtake us  a tragedy in which we are doomed to be victims.Costa Rica has declared itself neutral in all the armed conflicts of Central America. My Government will have its neutrality respected  calling upon whatever courage is needed. This we have demonstrated in words and in deeds. We desire to see all of the great Powers remove themselves from Central American disputes. Costa Rica does not abide the fueling of war or the extension of death in the region by external forces. While the entire world calls for peace in Central America  the clouds of war gather. While the entire world clamors for greater economic growth  in large parts of Central America the only growth is in poverty. I will not permit any armed group to use our territory in order to attack neighbors. I will not permit it because Costa Rica respects international law. I will not permit it because the existence of armed groups in our territory is a danger to our national security. Since we lack an army to defend ourselves  if we so acted  we would lose all legitimacy before the international community  in whose principles we rest the defense of our sovereignty. I will not permit it because such use of Costa Rican territory easily lends itself to the traffic of arms and to the traffic of drugs. I will not permit it because the moral standing of Costa Rica is sacred. I will not permit it because Costa Ricans believe in peaceful solutions and are not prepared to let their soil be trampled upon by those advocating violent ways. I will not permit it because Costa Ricans do not want war on their territory  or those who believe in war.Our commitment is to peace and to development. We aspire to more homes for our families and more employment for our work-force - and this is incompatible withwar.Because in Costa Rica we do not know the fear of liberty  we will not desert our trust in dialog. That is why we went to the meeting of Central American Presidents in Esquipulas  Guatemala. There  Central America reaffirmed its faith in democracy and in liberty. The Government of Managua stood cautioned that only democracy could shield against the suffering and war we wished to avoid.Costa Rica also upholds President Cerezo's initiative to create a Central American parliament. But we believe in this parliament only if it is composed of genuine expressions of democratic regimes in each of the Central American nations. We do not accept a regional forum that would serve only to legitimize dictatorships internationally.The Government of Nicaragua has accused my country before the International Court of Justice at The Hague of supposed complicity of my Government in warlike actions from Costa Rica. It is a little like the pot calling the kettle black  as the saying goes. We vigorously deny this charge.We are going to the Court at The Hague to defend ourselves. We are familiar with the publicity maneuvers of the Managua regime. We are tired of dialogs in which everything changes; tired of the insincere promises to negotiate. At The Hague we want the entire world to see the hidden truth of a Nicaragua that once again has betrayed Ssndino. Seven years ago Sandino arose to celebrate the liberty of his people. Once more he has been assassinated.We have received thousands and thousands of Nicaraguan refugees. As Costa Ricans  we are concerned about the consolidation of a totalitarian regime of Marxist ideology on our borders. Our people know that in Europe as well as in other regions of the world the geographical frontiers between West and East cost millions and millions of dollars in armaments  defensive systems and military alliances.Can the world understand that in Costa Rica we have no desire whatsoever even to consider the possibility of re-establishing armed forces? Can the world understand that we do not wish to continue receiving wave upon wave of refugees?I ask the world to understand  and I ask the great Powers  whatever their ideology  to understand  that for the Americas a pact for democracy  for pluralism and for liberty benefits all humanity and promotes peace throughout the world.I also bring a mandate from my people to discuss our concerns regarding the world economy and to talk of our proposals to reach a more humanistic development. In this difficult period of our history  we wish to write an especially frank and honest page. For this  we need a guaranteed peace for our country and a more just international economic structure.First and foremost  we are concerned that the return of political democracy in the Americas may not be accompanied by a more equitable international economic order.We are surprised by the paradox that today  some of the most severe economic restrictions that can be recalled since the crisis of the 1930s  are being imposed on Latin America. It will be difficult for history to record that many of the industrial nations were allies of Latin America in its efforts to democratize. At best  they will be viewed as indifferent spectators of a process that concerned them much less than the tribulations of the international private banks.In the recent past of Latin America  we saw how efficient and expert bankers stimulated the dreams of greatness of generals who restrained freedom and liberties in many lands. A short while ago  the international banks competed fiercely to lend to tyrants. Today  they unite to collect from democracies. Yesterday  they cared little that their money maintained the rule of despots. Today  they are not concerned with the suffering of those who pay in liberty. No one has the right to invoke the apolitical in order to commit the amoral. Such an attitude damages the dignity of our shared humanity and endangers civilized international relationships.The belligerence of the international financial community in its collection of debts contrasts with the serenity of spirit and sense of responsibility with which those in the third world have devoted themselves to consolidating their plans for political freedom. Not all those efforts benefit from the same ethical standards. Why is a club of Paris legitimate  but not a club of Cartagena or Buenos Aires? Why is there wisdom and propriety in a co-ordinating committee of private banks  which can dictate the behaviour of debtors  whereas it is dangerous for the presidents of the central banks of our nations to meet and plan joint action?We are concerned that multilateralism  a traditional instrument to fortify the autonomy of our nations  no matter how small  has been used for a different purpose. The economic conditions being imposed upon the third world are of such magnitude that the developed nations themselves do not dare impose them bilaterally. For such purposes they have recourse to certain multilateral organizations. That is a serious political error that may have grave consequences if not soon corrected.We are concerned about the distaste shown by certain powerful nations for the whole question of the political equality of all States. It appears to be reflected  at least in part  in the financial crisis affecting the United Nations. It seems that small and weaker nations are being denied the right to a dialog of equals  a dialog free from constraints or conditions. My Government desires the prompt solution of the financial problems of the Organization. Conscious of our limitations in this regard  ray country agrees to contribute its share  in the hope that the seed of equality will continue to grow in this forum  a fortress for lasting world peace. Costa Rica will fulfill its international commitments  but proposes adjustments to the rules of the game. Some things must changes countries with heavy debt burdens should be given the opportunity to grow  so that they can pay eventually  rather than be forced to pay now  with complete disregard for their continued impoverishment. Thus we may avert the bitterness of the weak and reduce the arrogance of the strong. It is crucial to fight for multilateral arrangements in all the organs of the United Nations. We denounce those of its agencies  however  that lend themselves to favoring a few nations or favoring only certain development strategies  diminishing the diversity that enriches the world.We must not continue to tolerate the questioning of assistance for housing  health or food while loans proliferate for the purchase of combat aircraft and soldiers* uniforms. Let us not again permit the inequalities of the industrialized world to be reflected in more poverty and anguish in the third world. The cost of past errors must be more equitably shared. The hope of development must return quickly to the weakest nations.In recent years  in large nations and small  we have been obliged to view through the lens of the international banking community  the world problems it has helped create. We have made the world small. Let us extend our vision beyond that of the banks to the struggles for peace and freedom  whose value in defeating poverty and guaranteeing respect for human rights in every corner of the globe we should assert. Many are the noble causes that have been debased under the scrutiny of the financier. Let us respond again to those noble causes in order to perceive the world anew. Let us not fear the only vision that can lead us to a lasting and secure peace: that of a world that struggles in solidarity to free itself from misery.What we have achieved as a people can be explained in large part by the fact that our ancestors made education the main national goal. Experience has taught us that increased education for all and an improved quality of family life offer a possible path even given the modesty of our limited means. We have learned that that by following that path we strengthen our democracy and widen the horizons of our freedoms.Like the vast majority of countries  today we confront adverse conditions  we do not believe  however  that that adversity can ever justify departing from social sensitivity in seeking solutions for development problems  we cannot escape the challenge to make our economy more efficient and adapt it to new conditions. We can  however  choose a way leading to that goal which does not entail unemployment and in which freedoms are never restricted. We can choose a way that  above all  preserves social peace. We wish to strengthen the only force that will permit us to grow in freedom.We are committed to a program that integrates our national youth in our structures for progress. We are committed to absorbing new technologies that promote development. We seek the full integration of women in the production process  with full equality with men in rights and responsibilities. We proclaim in our country that no farmer shall be without land and no land without farmers.We have placed at the center of all this effort a national challenge that transcends party lines; we desire to solve and will solve the problem of the lack of housing for thousands of dispossessed families.The priority given to that housing goal complies with the designation of 1987 as the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. Costa Rica will demonstrate that it is possible to end the shame of shanty-towns when we all work together in solidarity. This year  1986  is the year dedicated to peace by the internationalcommunity. The initiative for that came from my country. I can say with pride that in spite of adverse circumstances  in spite of the most absurd provocations  Costa Rica has strengthened the force of its peace. We shall also achieve success with housing   I propose to return here again in four years time  at the conclusion of my presidential mandate  to inform the Assembly that the shanty-towns in ray country are but a sad memory from the past.I also wish to come here to tell representatives that together we have spread peace throughout all Central America.I come from a nation whose calling it is to struggle so that the principles ofreason  word and action may permeate the world of international relations. Costa Rica knows that the gap between what is said and what is done has greatly widened over the past few years.The environment continues to deteriorate. Hunger and poverty increase. Armaments and the destructive capacity of the machinery of war increase. The protectionism of the powerful - the very same that proclaim the need for free trade - increases. Expressions of international solidarity are exchanged  while economic assistance is decreased.Rich nations continue to distance themselves from poor nations. Humanity is drunk with technologies that cause death because they are used without the capacity to control them. Each time we meet  we deplore the fact that our objectives are in contradiction with what is really happening in the world. But we must not lose faith; were it not for the existence of the United Nations  the gaps to which I have referred would be even more dramatic.In the name of Costa Rica  I must stress once again that we support every disarmament initiative. The nuclear race has transformed itself into the most gigantic monument ever created to honor the blindness of the powerful.With vigor and renewed faith in mankind  Costa Rica calls for the condemnation of all racial discrimination  which reduces man and offends civilization. A few weeks ago my Government severed diplomatic relations with the South African regime. We did so because we thought that all of the peaceful methods of exerting pressure should be intensified in order to put an end to such degrading practices.I wish to reiterate here our desire for an urgent dialog between Argentina and Great Britain to resolve the question of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands.We advocate the speedy elimination of the remaining vestiges of colonialism. It is time that the concept of overseas territories gave way to the liberty that has been sought for so many years by the peoples of those territories.At this time the world is witnessing once again how terrorism can extend its implacable cruelty. It is unpardonable that a man of peace of the stature and greatness of the former Prime Minister of Sweden  Olaf Palme  to whom I render tribute  should fall victim to fanatical and senseless violence. I believe we should focus all our energies on ways to counteract these practices.It may be advisable for the United Nations to consider the possibility of establishing an international brigade to counter terrorism. It is necessary to combat a practice that violates all we hold most dear. I repeat: we condemn terrorism of every kind regardless of its origin or form.I reaffirm again in this forum that Costa Rica believes that the war against drugs must be a common cause for the international community. There is no greater crime against the youth of the whole world than the traffic in narcotics.I reaffirm Costa Rica's desire to see the fight against hunger in Africa given first priority by the world community. There is a nuclear bomb much like Hiroshima's that explodes in silence every day  in the form of the lack of food that kills and destroys the bodies and minds of men  women and children.I reaffirm here Costa Rica's belief that we should never fear to enter into a dialog  and I urge this forum to open its doors to all nations that respect its Charter. Dialog can only contribute to the peaceful solution of problems by disarming threats of violence. My country therefore reaffirms its confidence that this forum of the United Nations will also serve  in the not too distant future  to enable the two Koreas to enter into a dialog and find the path to reconciliation.Political and economic exiles represent other wounds scarring the face of our world. Such scars are to be seen in my country. I wish at this time to thank the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee on Migration. Costa Rica needs much more help in dealing with the refugee problemsthat it is facing today.We support all efforts by the United Nations to seek peaceful solutions in the Middle East. We wonder how much more unnecessary suffering must still be endured before reason and harmony are restored in that region. Costa Rica also earnestly desires to see an end to the war between Iran and Iraq. There can be no historical justification for the death and desolation that follows in the wake of fanaticism.Costa Rica supports the unconditional independence of Namibia. We also look forward to the prompt liberation of Kampuchea and Afghanistan.Permit me to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and to this Organization for its unceasing efforts on behalf of peace. As long as this forum exists no one can ever forget the link between peace and development. As long we do not forget that link weshall all make common cause in fighting poverty  defending human rights regardless of frontiers and removing the fear of freedom from all peoples.Despite the misfortunes we have had in recent years  despite the increasing dangers in the Central American isthmus  despite the ever-growing inequalities in our world  Costa Rica reaffirms its unshakable faith in a higher destiny for mankind  since the soul of the peoples is nourished by freedom  democracy and peace.Today  more than ever  we must take up again the nobler causes - those that live in the soul of the peoples  overcoming fear for the sake of freedom.Let me conclude with pride by quoting the words of the great Spanish poet Miguel Hernandez:""Close the doors  warden  throw the latch.Lock up this man  but you cannot shackle his soul.There are many keys  many latches  many injustices;But you cannot shackle his soul."""
"35",1692,"CSK",41,1986,"I should like to congratulate Mr. Choudhury on his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly and to wish him everysuccess in his responsible post.In these difficult times which the Organization is now facing I wish also to express great appreciation of the commendable work of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in the interests of the objectives of the UnitedNations and its Charter.Last year's fortieth anniversary session of our Organization provided anopportunity to reaffirm its unique and irreplaceable role. Since that time  it hasgone through a new and complex stage in its activities. Unfortunately  no progresshas been achieved in solving the crucial issues relating to the strengthening ofinternational security  nuclear weapons or the halting of the arms race. There hasbeen no improvement so far in the strained international relations. The reasonsfor our concern have thus not been removed.Nevertheless we have witnessed some encouraging events  which have given rise to hope for a thaw in the international atmosphere. Political dialog has been reactivated. Disarmament negotiations have been resumed. The long-awaited and much-needed Geneva summit meeting has taken place. A strong impression has been made by the declaration and repeated extensions of the Soviet moratorium. The first phase of the Stockholm Conference has been successfully concluded. Agreements on the safe use of atomic energy have been signed in Vienna. Notable progress has been made on the question of the prohibition of chemical weapons. New signs have appeared in the efforts to solve regional problems. Ways of increasing security in Asia and in the Pacific region are being sought. Definite possibilities of strengthening international co-operation in the economic and humanitarian fields are taking shape. There have been extremely important achievements at the summit meeting of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement in Harare.The effect of all those positive factors constitutes a solid political basis for further progress in the policy of detente; it is a solid basis and capital bearing high interest. Logically  its value has been enhanced as a result of the positive and generally welcomed announcement that Mikhail Gorbachev's proposal to hold a meeting in Iceland has been accepted by President Reagan. We appreciate the fact that this agreement has been reached  as was stated  thanks to the realism and constructive approach of both sides. The meeting will undoubtedly provide a significant opportunity for reviewing the present international situation. We should like to believe that the Reykjavik meeting would proceed on the basis of such an analysis to chart a course leading to the solution of pending problems  especially those relating to certain questions of nuclear weapons. If that happens it will certainly encourage the further development of the policy of peaceful coexistence and broad international co-operation.The good news of the forthcoming meeting seems to respond to the desires of the entire international community. It is also fully consonant with the constructive atmosphere prevailing at our present session  especially the new symptoms and tendencies that have so clearly manifested themselves here so far.Consequently  the world is facing a choice. Everything will depend on the decisions we shall make*  whether we drift towards nuclear annihilation or allow the new political thinking on the preservation of life on earth to prevail.We in Czechoslovakia have always had an unswerving attitude. No matter what differences there may be in social systems or political positions  the will to prevent confrontation and reduce international tensions must prevail. This means that we must reject war in the interest of politics  since another war would mean the end of all politics. The future must not be allowed to be programed by military technologies. Diverse  often conflicting  interests must be reconciled in a way that enables both individuals and entire nations to live in peace without fear for the sorrow. This could be decisively facilitated by the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security embracing the military  political  economic and humanitarian spheres-  a system which would presuppose the adoption of material  political and legal  as well as moral and psychological  guarantees precluding the use of force  and make it possible to achieve equalsecurity for all by political means.Such a broadly conceived approach underlies the joint proposal of the Socialist countries which is before this session of the General Assentoly. It inspires us to believe that we can think afresh about how to implement and develop in a more meaningful way the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.Naturally  everybody talks about peace nowadays  but the concepts of peace are diametrically opposed. Some see it as a mere cease-fire-  others assert that to avert war means to rely on nuclear strength  with the concomitant claim to a right to abrogate unilaterally existing treaties on arms limitation. Under the doctrine of neo-globalism there is continued reliance on military force  aggression  economic extortion and the imposition of its will upon other countries and peoples. However  such a philosophy  based on the law of force  is pointless; it would be disastrous fear mankind as a whole.For our part  we believe that deterrence  intimidation and threats of retaliation could be replaced by firm guarantees of trust. Peaceful coexistence can and must become the highest universal principle of inter-State relations. Security must be viewed as mutual and indivisible.We see in such a set of fundamental practical norms reliable ways of dealing with some of the most complex problems of our epoch. It was within this context that they were formulated  with historic farsightedness  by the XXVTIth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Onion and endorsed by the XVIIth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. As the President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  Gustav Husak  has said  we regard that ""as a powerful impulse in the struggle for peace and progress"".We have given our full support to the central appeal of the International Year of Peace  which is being observed this year  and have made practical contributions to its implementation. We have gained valuable experience from this. It has confirmed that conditions are ripe for an intensification of the peace-building efforts of nations. Governments and the peoples throughout the world. Among the steps that could improve the political detente and strengthen mutual security none is more urgent than arms limitation. The horrifying momentum of nuclear and conventional armament on Earth must be halted and it must be prevented from reaching outer space. So far there is still time  but there is not much left.Indeed  mankind's destiny has now taken on a completely new perspective. Nuclear arsenals have achieved such absurd dimensions that they no longer serve their original purpose. Even as they are being accumulated the moment is drawing nearer when strategic parity will cease to be a factor of military-political deterrence. Mutual deterrence is now turning into its opposite. That situation in itself argues against the philosophy underlying the old political thinking to the effect that the further accumulation of such weapons is necessary.Unfortunately  the approach to arras limitation taken by some Western countries is still marked by obvious attempts simply to drag things out. Surely this is proved by the Vienna talks  where nothing has been achieved after 13 years and 40 rounds  and despite 26 proposals by the socialist countries. The truth is that many of those who so often call for progress prove by their actions that they still rely on military force. In their commitment to the policy of confrontation they even go so far as to make plans for besieging our planet from outer space. The question that here is this-  what is the purpose of the strategic revolution when demands for a revolution in disarmament are being made from all sides?All sorts of arguments are being used as pretexts for blocking progress. One of them is the question of verification  which has been raised constantly and inflated out of all proportion  as if there were a reluctance to recognize that thesocialist States sure completely ready to resolve this issue  including the question of on-site inspections  as was clearly demonstrated in Stockholm. After all  it would be just as impossible for us to accept disarmament treaties without strict and equitable verification measures.However  this assumes that there must be something to verify. This requires  first of all  that there be negotiations and agreement on the phased elimination of all nuclear weapons  a treaty on a comprehensive nuclear-weapon-test ban  and a number of other urgent issues on the rather extensive agenda.We are convinced that the program put forward by Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev on 15 January has opened a viable way to the solution of the entire range of issues relating to nuclear disarmament - strategic armaments  intermediate-range missiles in Europe and operational tactical forces. We regard this as the most detailed  specific and concrete basis for progress that has ever been submitted. It pays due regard to the legitimate security interests of all States  both nuclear and non-nuclear. It offers a truly historic opportunity to eliminate the threat of nuclear devastation. It provides for the safe  peaceful entry of human civilization into the third millennium. That program enjoys our full support. It should become a focal point in the work of the United Nations as well.We regard the continuance of nuclear testing as the equivalent of armament. We consider the Soviet Union's decision to extend its unilateral moratorium on all nuclear explosions through the end of this year  after it has already been in effect for more than 400 days  as proof of the highest sense of responsibility. That step - which is not an easy one to take in the light of one's own security needs - is welcomed throughout the world. It is indeed a genuine example that deserves to be initiated. The spontaneous applause in this Hall when Minister Shevardnadze mentioned that action in his statement once again confirmed this. Moreover  this example set by the Soviet Union provides yet another opportunity: it gives us a chance to think things over. We believe that one's attitude to this can be regarded as a yardstick by which to gauge one's sincerity.We value highly the efforts made on this important question by the group of six States from four continents and the Non-Aligned Movement as a whole. We would like their proposal  too  to be heeded by the United States. It would be the most natural  the easiest and indeed the least expensive way to halt the accumulation of nuclear capacity. It would preclude the sort of confrontation provoked by such testing. It would pave the way for further significant steps towards the preventing of nuclear war. And  it would be in keeping with the agreement readied at the Soviet-United States summit meeting at Geneva.We welcome the readiness of the Soviet Union to sign  any time and at any place  a treaty on a comprehensive nuclear-weapon-test ban. If an act of such historic significance were accomplished here and now it would indeed be a symbol of our Organization's commitment to this ideal.We also share the opinion that a basic prerequisite for the radical limitation of strategic nuclear systems is abstention from launching weapons into outer space. Is it not easier  more cost-effective and  above all  much safer to dismantle nuclear weapons than to build a so-called defense against them in the form of a rather complicated  costly and extremely hazardous space shield? That is why we demand that these weapons be dismantled.We give our unequivocal support to the preparation and adoption of a realistic program of joint  practical activities for the peaceful use of outer space. Only in this way can nations concert their efforts to work for the salvation of their planet  its atmosphere and its biosphere.We believe that the strengthening of universal security and confidence-building also depend on how reliably atomic power is used. We therefore advocate the establishment of an international system for the safe development of nuclear-power engineering embodying a universal commitment by each State individually and by all States collectively.We have acquired valuable experience in this respect. The 1982 Czechoslovak-Austrian agreement on the regulation of issues relating to nuclear facilities is a unique document  indeed the first of its kind. It served its purpose excellently after the Chernobyl accident. It provides convincing proof of the possibility of solving matters relating to the safe use of nuclear energy within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)   regardless of the social systems of the States involved.We favor the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones aid zones of peace in specific regions of the world - in central Europe  where we are ready to become part of such a zone  in northern Europe on the Balkan peninsula  in Africa  in the Indian Ocean and also in the South Pacific.We firmly advocate the world-wide elimination of chemical weapons and means of manufacturing them. In the spirit of our proposals submitted jointly with the German Democratic Republic  we are ready to continue to promote efforts to achieve the global prohibition of such weapons  in particular by means of establishing a chemical-weapon-free zone in central Europe.we wish to express our regret at the delays that have affected the convening of the Conference on disarmament and development  we support the holding of discussions next year on those closely interrelated problems of the present-day world.We attach great importance to the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. We regard it as a particularly necessary forum for negotiation  and as indeed the only place where even partial agreements can take the form of multilateral treaties. We are working to increase its effectiveness.The decisive arena in the struggle for a peaceful order in the world remains the European continent. It is there that the two strongest military-political groupings  possessing the most destructive types of weapons  are facing each other. Yet it is also there that the policy of detente has emerged  stemming from a common understanding of recognized realities.Despite all the roadblocks and pitfalls placed in its path and the mistrust and skepticism with which it has been confronted  detente has proved to have solid foundations. Its vitality was also demonstrated by the conclusion of the first stage of the Stockholm Conference. We regard the document adopted there as an agreement of outstanding significance in the process of building up a system of collective security in Europe. It is the most striking success achieved in moving towards a reduction of tension and an amelioration of the European political climate since the adoption of the Helsinki Final Act. It sets forth the relevant provisions of the Act  and provides sound conditions for productive achievements in other areas of negotiations on military detente and disarmament. The complex work in Stockholm  which demanded the maximum of political resolve  thus represents a triumph of common sense  political realism  and sense of responsibility for the future destiny of Europe. It is highly significant that all the participating States worked for the decision that was adopted  a fact which provides an encouraging impetus for the successful continuation of the all-European process.However  more time is needed. Military activities and transfers of troops to Europe must be still further limited. We must have firm and specific commitments to guarantee the non-use of force and the maintenance of peaceful relations. Military concepts and doctrines must be based solely on defensive principles.That is what was proposed by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty in their appeal to the States of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and indeed to all European countries at the session of the Political Consultative Committee held in Budapest last June  what is at issue here is a program of drastic reductions  amounting to half a million troops on each side and their respective armaments  including nuclear weapons for operational tactical purposes with a range of up to 1 000 kilometers  from the Atlantic to the Orals  with effective verification carried out jointly. We are prepare* to negotiate about such measures in any forum that may be agreed upon. Action on this issue really urgently needs new impetus.In Budapest we strongly urged the desirability of solving the extraordinarily important problem of the Soviet and United States intermediate-range missiles in Europe  representing a threat that still looms over our old continent. If thisissue can be resolved  Soviet missile complexes for operational tactical purposes will be withdrawn from the territories of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the German Democratic Republic. As we have heard in this Assembly also  various solutions are being considered. It is our view that any solution that results in the total elimination of such weapons from the continent would be in the interest of not only the Europeans but indeed all mankind.As for the forthcoming Vienna meeting  the experience gathered in Belgrade and Madrid shows that it should be a constructive forum and not an arena of confrontation. In view of the more favorable atmosphere in the world  it might indeed usher in a new phase in the policy of detente  become a real milestone cm the path of Helsinki  and formulate the mandate for the opening of the second disarmament phase of the Stockholm Conference. Of course we wish to promote actively all aspects of this all-European process  which has already become an integral part of the political awareness of our continent. We intend to pay particular attention to the development of co-operation in trade and economic affairs. Further progress must also be achieved in the spheres of culture  education  contacts  in for nation and humanitarian issues - but of course without the typg of vetoes and obstructions  witnessed this year in Berne.In that connection  we also have in mind specific and genuine human rights  in their full range and richness. It is not merely to issue declarations about them and to lecture others on the subject. What we need is something quite different*  fruitful co-operation  directed to safeguarding always and everywhere the right of people to live in peace and guaranteeing them lasting civil  spiritual  cultural and social freedoms.The peaceful settlement of international disputes and conflicts is something we regard as an essential precondition for the establishment of universal security. Unfortunately  this year  once again  we have failed to note any decrease in the persistent feverish temperature of the hotbeds of tension throughout the world.It is our opinion that a just and lasting peace in the Middle East can be secured neither by the arrogance of Tel Aviv nor by attempts at partial solutions. The right of the Palestinians to self-determination  including the establishment of a State of their own  must be unreservedly recognized. We continue to advocate the convening of an international conference to be attended by all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We consider that the organization of such a conference has received significant encouragement from the proposal by the Soviet Union for the establishment of a preparatory committee composed of the permanent enforcers of the Security Council.From the beginning  we have always advocated a speedy end to the war between Iraq and Iran through peace negotiations.We are in favor of converting the Mediterranean into a zone of lasting peace and co-operation and of the withdrawal of the fleets of the naval forces of both the United States and the Soviet Union from that area.We condemn the flagrant acts of State terrorism directed against Libya.We advocate the convening of an international conference on Cyprus under the auspices of the United Nations. Such a conference would help to secure independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity for that non-aligned country through peaceful means.We support the legitimate efforts of the Government of Nicaragua to strengthen the independence of that country and its defense capability. We also support the steps it has taken to reduce tension in Central America. We condemn the double standard of an attitude to national terrorism which passionately denounces it in words while supplying it with 3100 million intended to overthrow a democratically elected Government. We commend the activities of the Contadora Group on behalf of a peaceful settlement of the situation in the region.As a country that fought a battle fraught with sacrifices in order to achieve its independence  Czechoslovakia cannot ignore the brutal repression being exercised by the racists against the population of Namibia and the aggravation of the ruthless colonial exploitation of that people. At the same time we condemn the shameful policy of apartheid. It is a sad fact that some States Members of the United Nations - even  indeed  members of the Security Council - continue to act in contravention of the decisions of our Organization. They denounce the South African regime with tough rhetoric  but somehow they forget the main requirement  which is support for the adoption of effective mandatory sanctions. As we have recently heard  they have even vetoed such sanctions  thereby virtually lending support to Pretoria  and in so doing they are  wittingly or unwittingly  responsible for the denial of the legitimate rights of the people of Namibia. This  even after such demonstrations of the will of the international community as were witnessed at this year 's conferences at Paris  Vienna and in Hew York at the recent special session of the General Assembly  as well as at the summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement at Harare.Czechoslovakia is sincerely interested in lasting peace and security in Asia. He welcome any step in that direction. One such measure  which we regard as highly significant  is the broadly elaborated concept of security  co-operation  confidence and arms reduction in the Asian aid Pacific region advanced by the Soviet Union at Vladivostok on 28 July.We regard the agreement on the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea by the year 1990 as another such step.We equally value the constructive initiatives taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at reducing the level of military confrontation  establishing a nuclear-free zone of peace on the Korean peninsula and achieving the country's peaceful reunification on a democratic basis  without external interference.We highly esteem the role played in the struggle for peace  progress and genuine independence by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Through its principled attitudes and significant initiatives  the Movement has made a vital contribution to the elimination of the danger of nuclear war and to the solution ofthe acute problems in today's world. The recent eighth summit meeting of the countries members of the Non-Aligned Movement has confirmed this.Global security and durable peace are inconceivable without a fundamental improvement in international economic relations  which must be restructured on a just and democratic basis while the pending social issues of development are resolved. Numerous disputes and conflicts inevitably arise when such questions areignored.Nowadays  it is impossible even in economics to make provisions for one's own long-term security and prosperity at the expense of others. Such was the practice of the former colonial metropolitan Powers  and today's spokesmen of neo-globalism would like to continue along that course. They have also been abusing the distorted and fundamentally unfair structure of the international division of labor. That is why they have developed and promoted the debt syndrome. Acting through transnational banks and  if necessary  through intimidation  they have arrogated to themselves the right to determine the future of the developing countries. This was made very clear  inter alia  at this year's special session ofthe General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa.We oppose indebtedness being legitimized as a new international means ofexploitation.In conclusion  I should like to assure the Assembly that Czechoslovakia  guided by its loyalty to the purposes and principles of the Organization  will not relent in its endeavors to increase its effectiveness and to help it overcome the obstacles that beset its path. The Organization's immense potential should not be buried under a tangle of financial or procedural problems  which in fact originate in efforts that are designed to produce the opposite result. It would be truly worthwhile to consider and ponder the idea of holding special talks on a number of the pressing issues with regard to the Organization's activity.All the possibilities of this world Organization  this unique universal forum to which no alternative exists. Bust be folly utilized in the interest ofstrengthening the new political thinking  as well as cc-opera tier. and peaceful coexistence.As our Government's statement of its program has expressed it  ""the questions of war end peace rank first in our efforts in the field of foreign policy because we are aware of the fact that peace is the highest priority in our lives""."
"36",1715,"CUB",41,1986,"The Heads of State or Government  meeting in Harare  Zimbabwe during the eighth summit Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  expressed their deep concern over the acceleration in nuclear rearmament  and stated that never before had mankind been so close to self-destruction  and that the alternative today is not between peace or war  but between life and death. It is in those circumstances that the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly takes place.In his address to the Harare Summit  President Fidel Castro said:""Our world faces two deadly and hitherto unknown dilemmas  peace or total self-destruction  and a just international economic order or the most horrible fate for the vast majority of the peoples of the earth represented here  even if peace prevailed.""That state of affairs is the legacy the consequence  of the centuries during which our peoples suffered exploitation  plunder and slavery  imposed first by the colonial Powers and then by the neo-colonialists and the imperialists. We have fought for centuries to shake the yoke of foreign domination  to attain freedom and independence  to achieve the right to strive for development. That battle is not over yet. Everywhere around the world  the stubborn refusal of the main developed capitalist countries to accept the true independence of our peoples is evident.That is the explanation of the nuclear rearmament policy  the uninterrupted development of new weapons of mass destruction  the accumulation of every type of strategic bombers  aircraft carriers  battleships  submarines  and strategic missiles  and of the installation of military bases all over the world by the imperialists who  not content with militarizing our planet  are also attempting to militarize outer space.The deployment of weapons  on earth and in space  is aimed at maintaining or recovering their military predominance and superiority  in order to continue to exploit the human and natural resources of the world. The United States leads and promotes this terrible process which is threatening the world with war and hunger  with nuclear destruction and endless poverty. Enormous sacrifices have been required to deal with that situation.""Socialism  intrinsically  is incompatible with war  with the exploitation of the sweat and natural resources of other peoples. Socialism does not need to make investments abroad  to establish military bases outside its borders  or to carve up the world. It does not need to produce weapons to give impetus to the economy and enrich monopolies; it knows perfectly well that resources can and should be invested in factories  hospitals  schools  homes  recreation and cultural centers  and other more noble endeavors. The heaviest burden imperialism has imposed on socialism is the need for arms expenditure  as my country  only a few miles away from the United States  knows it all too well.""In Harare at the eighth summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement  the Heads of State or Government expressed their concern over the rapid acceleration of the arms race  especially in the nuclear field. They expressed their deep concern over the announcement by the United States Administration that it would not abide by the provisions of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty of 1979 (SALT II). They called upon the United States Administration to reconsider the attempts to take the arms race into outer space and strongly reaffirmed the principle that outer space is the common heritage of mankind and should be used only for peaceful purposes. They welcomed the comprehensive and timely nuclear disarmament Program  with a phased timetable and various deadlines  recently proposed by the Soviet Union. They called for a moratorium in the production and deployment of nuclear weapons while negotiations for a nuclear-test-ban treaty were under way. They welcomed the unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests declared by the Soviet Union in August 1985  which has been extended several times  most recently  until January 1987; and they called upon the United States to join the moratorium.Cuba wishes to take this occasion to reiterate its firm support for those demands  which enjoy the support of the Non-Aligned Movement  which virtually means the support of mankind as a whole.The abundant resources now invested in the arms race could well be devoted to improve the quality of life of human beings  millions of whom suffer from hunger  and from lack of medical care  employment  education and social welfare.Aware of the significance of the link between disarmament and economic and social development  Cuba regrets that the international conference on that question  which had been scheduled for last August  was not convened ; and looks forward to the adoption of the relevant decisions needed so that it can be convened and meet without fail in 1987.The continuing world economic crisis whose cruel consequences are felt above all by the under developed countries  continues to cause deep concern. Despite years of efforts  despite the good will and flexibility that developing countries have displayed in multilateral organizations  it is shameful that they are still coming up against a lack of political resolve in developed capitalist countries  particularly in the United States  to begin a just and reasonable negotiating process to deal with and solve the problems of international economic relations.The economic picture in 1985  and so far in 1986  and its main trends  confirms that the continuance of the present system of international economic relations perpetuates a state of economic instability and crisis. Even in industrialized countries an unprecedented imbalance in trade and financial relations was recorded during this period  while the net transfer of resources from developing to developed countries continued.The majority of underdeveloped countries experienced negative or zero growth in their per capita gross national product in 1985. In Latin America  in particular  national income per capita decreased for the fifth consecutive year; and in the case of Africa this indicator is lower now than it was 15 years ago.Sustained high interest rates  increased trade protectionism  growing manipulation of commodity prices  including the collapse of oil prices  to which there is no end in sight and which has had disastrous effects on the economies of many underdeveloped countries  as well as monetary speculation and unilateral variations in exchange rates  are evidence of an international economic order which is unjust and at a critical stage.Unequal flows  the increasing deterioration of the terms of trade  subsidized agricultural production  dumping and the flight of capital to the major financial centers in the United States and Western Europe are problems which  far from being resolved  have become more entrenched in the system  thus widening the abyss between developed and developing countries.Several years ago before this Assembly President Fidel Castro defined the untenable situation and the nature of the foreign debt as plunder. At the fortieth session of the Assembly my delegation joined other heads of delegations  including a great number of Heads of State or Government  to draw attention to the alarming nature of the third world's foreign debt as epitomizing  the distortions I have described. A large number of the delegations present expressed the opinion that the disproportionate external indebtedness of developing countries was a product of the old  unjust and irrational order prevailing in international economic relations  we stated that the decisive solution of this problem was essential and could not be postponed  and that it was an illusion to think that it could be resolved through mere palliatives  debt renegotiation and traditional prescriptions.Only a few days ago  at the already historic eighth summit Conference of non-aligned countries  the Heads of State or Government of a large number of third-world countries confirmed this reasoning in their statements and decisions and reiterated their alarm at the political and social consequences which the persistence and growth of the foreign debt could have.For some time now  Cuba has referred  on the basis of criteria and data analytically drawn from internationally recognized sources  to the unpayable and noncollectable nature of the debt. Recent world economic  social and political developments confirm our contention.Today  the foreign debt of developing countries is a far more serious problem than it was a year ago. It is larger  the possibilities of repayment are even less  and a number of economic  social and natural problems have compounded and complicated the difficulties of the situation. Credit terms offered by international financial institutions have not improved  economic growth is not gaining momentum and development faces ever greater obstacles. In sum  the crucial demands made by developing countries in various groups and forums have been rejected or ignored and the political and social dangers already foreseen are becoming ever more threatening.In this context  the imperialists continue to strive to preserve their interests. The United States Government's much lauded Baker plan proved inadequate and not in keeping with the magnitude of the problem.As the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 have repeatedly said  the foreign debt is a political problem  the roots of which are to be found in the unjust international economic order impressed on us. Responsibility for its solution must be shared by the developed creditor countries and the international financial and banking institutions.In line with historical and present reality  we are  in the final analysis  compelled to reiterate that our countries are not debtors but creditors; creditors because of the sweat  the blood and the wealth extracted from our peoples during centuries of the colonial exploitation that led to the development of today's powerful capitalist economies; creditors because of the resources stolen from us  day after day  through unfair trade; creditors because of the capital which flows from our countries towards developed countries in search of what are inordinately high and unjust interest rates.The United Nations cannot remain aloof or fail to contribute actively to the solution of this problem. If its main organ  the General Assembly  did not devote the greatest attention to this matter it would be failing to fulfill its duties under the Charter.Cuba reaffirms once again its firm conviction that the foreign debt of the third world cannot be paid and must  therefore  be written off; that the resources required to meet these obligations without affecting the financial community might be found in a reasonable reduction in expenditure on armaments  which endangers the lives of all human beings  rich and poor alike; and that the sole  real and lasting solution to this and other similar problems relating to the survival of the majority of the people on this planet lies in development and the implementation of the new international economic order approved by this Assembly in 1974.He repeatedly ask ourselves how long the peoples can endure this heavy burden; how long it will be before the international community takes effective action to save the lives of millions of people and provide a more dignified life for many more whose existence is now short and painful? What should the United Nations role be in this endeavor?He hope that the forty-first session of the General Assembly will give new life to the principles and instruments adopted on this question  such as the new international economic order  the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and the International Development strategies  which continue to have full validity. We look forward to the ratification of the Convention on the Law of the Sea by all States  to prevent the indiscriminate exploitation of the oceans and sea-bed by imperialist countries possessing sophisticated technologies. We hope that serious thought will be given to these matters by those that wish to perpetuate an order which endangers the peace and stability of the world we all share.The history of Latin America is to a large extent a history of united States aggression against Latin American peoples for the purpose of plundering their natural resources and subjecting them to domination. Many chapters in that long and sad history refer to Cuba. For 25 years  and to this day  the United States has continued to impose an illegal economic blockade against our country  a blockade that has been extended by the present Administration. It continues to conduct spy flights  in violation of our air space  and the Guantanamo Naval Base  a putrid excrescence of empire  remains entrenched on our territory  against the expressed will of our people and Government.A similar and more recent case is that of Nicaragua  whose right to self-determination is violated by continued acts of aggression organized and financed by the United States with the support of its allies in the region. The dirty war against the people of Sandino has caused the Nicaraguans heavy losses and led the Latin American peoples and States to understand ever more clearly that  as long as imperialism persists  they will suffer the same fate as the Nicaraguan people when they choose to take the road towards true independence.We recently witnessed the predominance of the United States Government when it unscrupulously vetoed a draft resolution in which the Security Council requested strict observance of the findings of the International Court of Justice related to activities against Nicaragua. In Harare  the Heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries condemned the rejection of the Court's decision by the United States Administration as a flouting of international law.Mankind must not allow a country - no matter how powerful - to violate international law with impunity. Disregard for the Court's findings and the subsequent veto of a draft resolution in the Security Council are further steps in the United States aggressive escalation in the region which deserves our strongest condemnation.The history of the more than seven years that have elapsed since the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution has shown the flexible negotiating position of the Nicaraguan Government  while revealing the real designs of the present United States Administration  which obstructs peace efforts to achieve a negotiated political settlement tb the Central American crisis.At their Summit Conference  the non-aligned countries expressed condemnation of the escalation of aggression and attacks against Nicaragua  particularly the violation of its airspace and territorial waters  the holding of international maneuvers and other acts of intimidation  the use of neighboring countries as bases for aggression and the training of mercenary groups. They term those actions ""terrorist practices"". They likewise condemned as illegal and immoral the United States appropriation of funds to finance mercenary forces  while emphasizing that it is not only a violation of Nicaragua's sovereignty and independence but also an attack on the principles and objectives of the Non-Aligned Movement and a violation of the United Nations Charter.The crisis in El Salvador is ever more serious. Despite United States imperialist's sustained support for the genocidal regime  the people's support for the struggle of Salvadorian patriots rallied around the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation-Revolutionary Democratic Front (FMLN-FDR) continues to grow.The Eighth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement  recalling General Assembly resolution 39/119 which called on all States to refrain from interference in the internal affairs of El Salvador  reiterated its appeal to the United States Administration to take a constructive stand in favor of a political solution of the Salvadorian conflict.Cuba supports a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Central America  including a United States commitment to renounce its aggressive actions against the Nicaraguan people and favor a negotiated political solution in El Salvador.My country supports Latin American efforts to seek a negotiated solution in the context of which action by the Contadora and Support Groups  in spite of all the difficulties  are an expression of the wish of Latin American countries that their sovereignty be respected without the interference of the big Power to the North.Our America has been the theater of imperialist intervention. If we were to mention all United States interventions in Latin America - from Mexico to Argentina  from Cuba to Grenada  from the Dominican Republic and Haiti to Colombiaand should we include the regimes installed or kept in power through open imperialist intervention  the map of the continent would be filled in without exception.We must therefore reiterate our solidarity with the struggle for independence  freedom and development of the peoples of our region; with the heroic Chilean people  facing the cruel and pro-imperialist Pinochet regime  which has currently stepped up terror and repression and for which  sooner rather than later  the great vistas depicted by Salvador Allende shall be open; with Peru  that suffers pressures from the International Monetary Fund (IMF); with Panama  that demands respect for the Canal Agreements and faces an imperialist campaign of destabilization; wit** Bolivia  claiming its right to a recognized  useful  sovereign and free outlet to the sea; with Guatemala  which for more than 30 years has been suffering the most cruel repression by pro-imperialist military regimes which assassinated more than 80 000 citizens and labeled them as ""missing""; with Paraguay  where the long-standing Stroessner tyranny drains the nation's blood; with Haiti  striving to get rid of a ""made in USA"" Duvalierism without Duvalier; with all the peoples who have had to face the consequences of imperialist penetration and domination.We condemn the presence of imperialist military bases in Puerto Rico  Guantanamo  the Malvinas Islands and other parts of our America  which are a true threat to the security of our countries and to peace in the region. As President Fidel Castro recently said:""In the Middle East and the North of Africa  Cuba has been  is and will always be in solidarity with the just struggle of the Arab peoples  victims of imperialist and Zionist aggression. Cuba resolutely supports the PalestineLiberation Organization (PLO) and embraces the noble cause of the Palestinian people and their right to independence and a national State. Disregard of those rights cannot last forever nor will it be possible to envisage peace in the Middle East while such monstrous injustice continues to exist."" Cuba calls for the convening under United Nations auspices of an international peace conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).Earlier this year we condemned the unjustified act of aggression against Libya by the United States which left a toll of hundreds of dead and wounded and many material losses. Regrettably  this Organization was unable to condemn that despicable act because of the abuse by sense countries of their veto power in the Security Council.Cuba reiterates its well-known stand on the need to persevere in efforts to put an end to the Iraq-Iran war  establish peace and initiate the process of recovery from the damages caused by a conflict which should never have begun.Cuba supports the just cause of the Lebanese people for national unity and peace. It supports the people of Cyprus in its struggle to defend its national unity  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment.Cuba reiterates its repudiation of-the continued United States military presence in Taiwan  an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China.Cuba expresses its strongest solidarity with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its struggle for the peaceful reunification of the country and the withdrawal of United States occupation troops from the South of the peninsula. We reiterate our position that the next Olympic Games should be shared by North and South Korea  otherwise Cuba shall not participate in an event which will serve only to support one of the most repressive and discredited regimes in the world. Cuba supports efforts to seek a negotiated political solution to the situation in South-West Asia  with strict respect for Afghanistan's sovereignty.In the present world millions of human beings long for peace. However  a look around us suffices to realize the extent to which mankind is threatened today by war and destruction.In fact it is not a question of one war but of many wars provoked by colonialism  which refuses to disappear  and by neo-colonialism  which has followed it.The Sahraoui people are still unable to exercise their right to self-determination and independence  notwithstanding their readiness to negotiate a just and definitive solution to the conflict in their region. The fighters of the Polisario Front  representatives of the people of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic  are faced with the obstinate refusal by the Government of Morocco to discuss the implementation of the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity and of the General Assembly. My country reaffirms its support for the Sahraoui people and urges the countries which have not yet done so to recognize the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic.A similar situation developed in the south Atlantic with the British military occupation of the Malvinas Islands  which in 1982 brought mourning to two States Members of this Organization. The united Nations has been unable to ratify Argentina's sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands only because of the United Kingdom's refusal to recognize it and its insistence on perpetuating that colonial anachronism. Several resolutions by this Assembly provide for a negotiated solution of this dispute  which should be settled through negotiations as soon as possible.Puerto Rico continues to be under the colonial domination of the United States of America despite the subterfuges by consecutive United States administrations to cover up that fact. Recently the United Nations Committee on decolonization adopted a resolution on the colonial situation of the people of that country  recognizing their right to independence and self-determination  their Latin American and national identity  and the need for the Committee to continue to devote its attention to the issue after having heard several dozen petitioners representing all political views in the country  all of whom agreed that Puerto Rico was a united States dependency and therefore was fully entitled to choose freely its political status.Before concluding my statement I should like to mention an issue which will undoubtedly have a bearing on our work. We are taking part in this forty-first session under the shadow of the financial uncertainty created by the policy of blackmail and pressure exerted by the United States Government against democratic multilateral organizations. The United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has already been under such pressure because of its work  which is consistent with the will of the international majority  and we are now witnessing new attempts by the United States Government to undermine the principles of the United Nations through immoral pressure which constitutes blatant violations of the Charter. It is true that the Organization requires administrative and managerial adjustments  but it is sheer fiction to call a political phenomenon  which has its roots in the design of one Government to subject the action of States in United Nations forums to its own will  a ""financial crisis"". The Kassel um amendment and other legal schemes of the United States roust not hang over our heads like so many swords of Damocles. The mere formulation of such schemes by United States legislative bodies is not enough  for those very bodies have established international commitments and obligations under the Charter of the United Nations.The problem we are facing is political and therefore it requires political solutions. Cuba will do its best to contribute to an improvement of the administrative and budgetary management of the Organization and will support any initiative honestly aimed in that direction. At the same time  Cuba will condemn and oppose actions which are directed against the democratic integrity of theOrganization or which try to suppress  weaken or derail Programs of interest to the majority of the States Members of the United Nations.At this time when the future of the United Nations is threatened  it is imperative that all those who believe in the Organization should .reassert its principles and support its work on behalf of peace  development and the well-being of our peoples.Only a week ago  from this rostrum  we expressed Cuba's views regarding the situation in southern Africa. We reiterated our solidarity with the struggle of the peoples of South Africa and Namibia against apartheid and for freedom and independence. Twenty years have elapsed since the United Nations terminated South Africa's Mandate over Namibia and assumed direct responsibility for the Territory. Since then  that decision has been ratified by the Security Council and many international organizations. The International Court of Justice  for its part  has declared that the continued occupation of Namibia by South Africa is illegal and constitutes a violation of international law. The United Nations has been quite clear concerning the obligation of South Africa to withdraw from Namibia and by resolution 435 (1978) it adopted a universally accepted plan for the establishment of Namibia's independence.Efforts by the international community have  however  come up against the arrogance of racist South Africa which  protected by its shameless alliance with the Government of the United States and supported by other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  has not only remained illegally in Namibia -where it has also set up the heinous apartheid system - but has also turned it into a launching pad for its acts of aggression against independent neighboring States  in particular against the People's Republic of Angola  making southern Africa one of the most dangerous centers of tension today.As President Fidel Castro aptly pointed out ""Apartheid is a direct consequence of the colonial system  of the brutal manner in which the African peoples were forcibly deprived of their lands and natural resources and their children enslaved and sold the world over. Apartheid has endured solely because of the support extended to it by the United States and NATO countries  which have in South Africa a strategic ally  a source of raw materials  a market for investments and profits for the transnational corporations  at the expense of the sweat and blood of millions of Africans.""Therein lies the meaning of the commitment of those countries to Pretoria: defense of the sordid interests of their corporations  it is truly a commitment to destroy human dignity  to exclude all possibility of independence  to spread the cancer of apartheid to the rest of the continent and to subject it to neo-colonial and imperialist exploitation. For that reason the struggle for Namibia's independence necessarily requires the eradication of apartheid.The powerful movement that threatens to bring down the corrupt structure of the opprobrious system in South Africa and crown with victory the heroic struggle of the Namibian people is now joined by an international consensus in favor of the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and of the imposition of sanctions on South Africa to compel it to abide by the will of the United Nations.President Fidel Castro proclaimed at Havana:""Both the Yankee imperialists and the South African racists are doing everything possible to have Cuban internationalist troops withdraw from Angola and are trying to make their withdrawal a condition of Namibia's independence. The Governments of Angola and Cuba have jointly replied:Implement resolution 435 (1978) on Namibia  cease all threats against Angola  stop the foul war and support for mercenaries: then the gradual withdrawal of the 20 000 Cuban fighters who are defending strategic lines in southern Angola will begin. The rest of the Cuban military personnel will be withdrawn only when the sovereign Governments of Angola and Cuba deem it unconditionally proper.'""""The true key to the question is that as long as apartheid exists in South Africa  as long as that country is ruled by a racist and fascist Government there will be no security for Angola or for any other country in southern Africa and the independence of Namibia will be nothing more than fiction."" I must reiterate that Cuba is ready to stay in Angola  in fulfillment of its internationalist duties  for as long as necessary - that is to say  until threats against the territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty of Angola have ceased  until apartheid has disappeared and Namibia is independent.The tine has come to translate words into action. This Assembly oust demand that the comprehensive mandatory sanctions envisaged in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter be imposed against the racist South African regime. The so-called linkage  which the imperialists and their partners in Pretoria use as a pretext for obstructing Namibia's independence  must be firmly rejected. The Security Council must ensure the implementation without further delay of resolution 435 (1978). We must condemn the shameful alliance of imperialism and Herr Botha's Boer fascism and demand the immediate cessation of the in famous imperialist support for apartheid. It is absolutely necessary to increase and broaden the economic  political and military assistance to the liberation movements in southern Africa so that they may continue to wage successfully their liberation war for independence and social justice and against racist fascism and apartheid. Further  we must strengthen our political and material solidarity with the front-line States in their struggle against the aggression of the apartheid regime.Each day  each hour  that brings us closer to the collapse of apartheid in South Africa will be one day  one hour  less of blood and pain for the peoples who suffer under and struggle against oppression and of shame for mankind.Those peoples and their struggling vanguards share the glory - as President Fidel Castro asserted in Harare -""of having shown the world that today  as yesterday and tomorrow  nothing can stop the march of history; no force in the world can keep human dignity and freedom indefinitely in chains""."
"37",1761,"CYP",41,1986,"Sir  I should like first of all to congratulate you on your unanimous and well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. We hope and trust that under your able guidance  ensured by your skill  dedication and objectivity  this session will yield positiveresults.I also wish to express our sincere appreciation to your predecessor Mr. Jaime de Pinie's of Spain for the excellent manner he guided the deliberations of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. He undoubtedly distinguished himself as a man of commitment to the ideals of the United Nations.Our sincere appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his endeavors towards strengthening the United Nations in view in particular of the grave difficulties  economic and others  with which our Organization is faced.When we gathered in this hall  last year  to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations and evaluate the progress achieved in translating its principles and purposes into living realities  we concluded that the record was still far from being satisfactory. Now  a year later the record is not much better. The situation prevailing in the world continues to be more often one of affront to and violation of the very principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter rather than one of commitment and adherence to them. Thus  the use or threat of use of force in international relations  aggression  military occupation ind foreign interference in the internal affairs of States as well as the persistent violation of human rights in many parts of the world are still frequent phenomena. No one can deny that if that frightening vulnerability of the international political system remains unchecked  it would vitiate the very concept of collective security which lies at the heart of the Charter  not to speak of the ultimate disastrous consequences for humanity as a whole.Despite the fact that there exists unanimity among nations as to the validity of the Charter and the necessity for preserving and further strengthening international co-operation  the threats to international peace and security are not only ever present but are on the increase. Although since the establishment of the United Nations mankind has so far avoided the insanity of a third world war  war itself has not been eliminated. More than a hundred limited wars have taken place in many parts of the world because of the inability of the United Nations to prevent such conflicts.The pursuit of narrow national interests  often in direct violation of the principles of the Charter  has become common practice. The underlying reason for the persistence of such violations  usually both flagrant and gross  is that they are carried out with impunity  the perpetrators being able to flout with arrogance the international community's decisions. In all those cases  Article 25 of the Charter remains a dead letter and decisions of the Security Council  even those unanimously adopted  remain unimplemented. It is a sad fact that the very basis on which the United Nations rests is being eroded and in the face of this  the Organization appears inefficient and incapable. Respect by Member States of the decisions of the principal organs of the United Nations  especially those of the Security Council  provides the essential prerequisite for the maintenance of international peace and security as envisaged in the Charter. As long as such respect is lacking  the Organization will be virtually hamstrung in resolving conflict situations. Only when compliance by Member States with the resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council becomes the rule will the United Nations fully perform its basic role as expressly provided for in the Charter.The Charter provides fully for an institutional framework for the taking by the Security Council of effective enforcement measures for the maintenance or restoration of international peace. But the measures provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter have not so far been used  thus weakening the capacity of the United Nations to deal effectively with situations posing a threat to international peace and security. We maintain that it is high time to re-examine the issue and hold a constructive dialog aiming at giving life to all the pertinent provisions of the Charter and at ensuring strict compliance with United Nations resolutions.We must also proceed with determination and vigor to provide the Security Council with the necessary means for the creation of an effective collective international security system as provided for in the Charter. Only then will the United Nations be able to deal decisively with the international anarchy and lawlessness that prevails today  secure the prerequisites for general and complete disarmament and ensure for itself the prestige and authority that it needs in order to pursue its task successfully.The absence of an effective collective international security system as provided for in the Charter is no doubt the major stumbling block to real progress towards disarmament. The absence of such a system not only prevents the greatPowers from dealing with the problem of disarmament with confidence and without suspicion but also encourages even small States to enter into local arras races. It is therefore imperative that we all concentrate our efforts as a matter of high priority on the establishment of an international security system  and any proposals to that effect should be seriously studied within the context of a result-oriented dialog for the purpose of achieving the desired objective.A lot of discussion on this issue has b an taking place since the establishment of the United Nations  but unfortunately  for various reasons  it has never received the attention it deserves. It must by now be absolutely clear that such a system constitutes an imperative necessity. All Members of the United Nations bear a great responsibility in this respect  but if the effort is to succeed it should have the genuine and meaningful support and positive contribution of the great Powers  and in particular the super-Powers.Whilst general and complete disarmament obviously cannot be achieved without a system of international security as provided for in the Charter  this does not mean that efforts aiming at detente  at halting the arms race and for the reduction of armaments are not worth pursuing. On the contrary  every effort must be made in this respect. The greater the extent to which this is achieved  the fewer the dangers to international peace and security and to the survival of the human race. The escalation of the arms race  both nuclear and conventional  must end without any further delay and a reverse process must begin aiming at limiting as much as possible the means of destruction. There are today more than 50 000 nuclear weapons amassed by the nuclear Powers  not to speak of other means of mass destruction or of conventional arsenals. A small portion only of existing nuclear weapons would be enough to cause the complete annihilation of human life on our planet.An encouraging sign is the fact that there seems to be a real apprehension of the dangers involved in the escalation of the arras race on the part of all countries  including the nuclear Powers. This apprehension  which in recent years has appeared to be growing  is in itself an incentive to try to do as much as possible towards halting the arms race and reducing the dangers of a nuclear holocaust.All countries have a responsibility to contribute in this respect  but of course it is undoubtedly the primary duty of the nuclear Powers  and in particular the super-Powers  to take all possible action and measures to prevent a nuclear catastrophe.There are in fact some signs that could be described as positive. The summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev held in November last year  though it produced no concrete agreement  created a momentum and a constructive atmosphere that could pave the way for possible breakthroughs in the near future.Similarly  the successful outcome a few days ago in Stockholm of the Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe will  we hope  contribute to the lessening of suspicions regarding military maneuvers and troop movements in Europe.We also welcome the constructive dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union within the context of mutual and balanced force reduction in Vienna and we hope that an agreement will be worked out regarding reductions in conventional weapons and military forces in Europe. Furthermore  the recent movement in the positions of the super-Powers in the Geneva arms control talks  especially in the area of medium-range missile forces  is a source of further encouragement.We support all initiatives and proposals aimed at progress in the field of arms control and in this connection we welcome the extension by the Soviet Union of the unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing. We regard this as an important step in the right direction and towards a total ban on nuclear tests. We would also like to reiterate our appreciation of the initiative of the six countries - namely  Greece  India  Argentina  Mexico  Sweden and Tanzania - which reflects the concern of the world at large for dStente and nuclear disarmament.I have referred to some positive signs. The significance of the relations between the two super-Powers as a barometer of the international climate focuses the eyes of the world today on the prospects for a new summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev. We hope that nothing will stand in the way of such a meeting. Furthermore  we hope that when that meeting does take place it will lead to concrete results not only in the field of arms control and disarmament  which are obviously the primary objectives  but also in regard to regional conflicts  which present a threat to international peace and security  we hope and trust that the new summit meeting will herald the beginning of a new era of hope and peace for humanity.The world's economic situation is related to some extent to the expenditures on armaments. The level of global military spending today is estimated at more than $US 900 billion annually. A fraction of those resources  both financial and human  if devoted to development would lead to the realization of economic and social progress for millions. We hope that the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  to be held in Paris in 1987  will produce positive results.Generally speaking   one cannot but underline the fact that the world economic situation remains critical. The prolonged economic difficulties facing developing countries have seriously affected the pace of their development. These problems  coupled with the obsolete and structurally deficient system of economic relations  serve only to aggravate the striking imbalance existing between the North and the South.In today's world of economic interdependence  there is no alternative to global negotiations which should lead towards the long overdue establishment of a new international economic order. We therefore cannot but maintain our belief that global negotiations should be launched as soon as possible as we assess their ability to bring true solutions to the problems confronting the world.As a necessary step we attach great importance to the Ministerial Conference which will take place in North Korea in 1987  as decided by the recent summit conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at Harare  for the purpose of strengthening South-South economic co-operation. The success of that conference will  I am sure  enhance the chances for a more fruitful dialog between the North and the South.On the other hand  the special session of the General Assembly convened last June to consider the critical economic situation in Africa and the Program ofAction for African Economic Recovery and Development for the years 1986-1990 were a major achievement for the African Governments and the international community as a whole. It has been clearly demonstrated that when the essential political will is displayed by all the work of the United Nations can be constructive and have positive results. The challenge now is to translate the Program of Action into concrete terms. This will require sustained efforts by all concerned  and we believe that  given the determination of African Governments and the encouraging response of the international community  the chances for success are considerable.I shall now refer to some of the most serious international problems in different parts of the world. A great number of us discussed these same problems only three weeks ago at the Harare summit conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which coincided with the twenty-fifth anniversary of its establishmentat Belgrade in 1961.During the 25 years of its existence  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countrieshas played a positive role in world affairs and has sought to contribute to the promotion of peace  the improvement of international relations  and the establishment of a more just world. Cyprus  a founding member  will continue to follow the policy of non-alignment and will actively participate in the Movement's efforts and activities. We are both honored and proud that Cyprus has been chosen as the venue for the next ministerial conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. In this connection  I should like to express our gratitude to the Movement for its solidarity with and consistent support of the just cause of Cyprus.I believe that the recent Conference in Harare magnified the need to strengthen the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in furtherance of its principles and objectives. The principles and objectives of non-alignment are in complete accord with the principles and purposes of the United Nations. I believe thatwithout the Kweaent and its concerted efforts the United Nations would have been even weaker today. One of the primary objectives of the Btoveaent is the strengthening of the United Nations  aid I have no doubt that it will continue to pursue that objective with determination and vigor. The United Nations must become stronger and more effective so that it my successfully discharge its responsibilities and mission as envisaged in the Charter. The conference at Harare was not only an occasion to take stock of the achievements of the Movement} it was also an opportunity to voice our concerns and views with regard to the problemfacing the world today. Fittingly  South Africa and Namibia were central issues in our deliberations at Harare.The situation in southern Africa continues to be dominated by tumultuous events. The evil policy of apartheid is still a grim reality in South Africa-  it constitutes a crime not only against the black majority in South Africa but also against mankind as a whole. It presents a real challenge to the United Nations. Condemnations are of course being voiced in all parts of the world  but they are falling on deaf ears. It is now recognized by all that apartheid means the negation of all human values and principles enshrined in the Charter and embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Despite the universal condemnation  concrete action in the form of effective measures as expressly provided for in the Charter are still to be adopted. Thus oppression and tyranny are exercised in South Africa against millions of the black majority by a racist regime which continuously and arrogantly flouts the international community.The world Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  held in Paris last June  indicated beyond any doubt the growing demand for comprehensive sanctions in order to bring about the dismantling of the abhorrent system of apartheid. Cyprus associates itself fully with the declarations of the Conference as well as with all Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and declarations adopted by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries on the issue. At the same time we express our solidarity with and undiminished support for the just struggle being waged by the oppressed people of South Africa and call for the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners.The concern of the international community over Namibia was manifested by the holding of a special session of the General Assembly on the issue last week. Cyprus  a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  joins the international community in reiterating its consistent support for and solidarity with the people of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  their sole and authentic representative  in their just and legitimate struggle for national independence  self-determination and sovereignty in a united Namibia. We call for the immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Recent events in Namibia indicate the necessity for resolute action so that the Namibian people may achieve their noble goals offreedom and human dignity.Another most disturbing aspect of the situation in the southern African regionis to be found in South Africa's policies and actions against neighboring States  including military attacks and attempts at destabilization. Armed raids against Angola  Botswana  Lesotho  Zambia and Zimbabwe during recent months have been condemned without reservation by the international community. We take this opportunity once again to voice our condemnation of those illegal actions and our complete solidarity with the front-line States. The critical situation in the Middle East is also of great concern  we reiterate our position that the question of Palestine constitutes the core of the Middle East problem. We are certain that there can be no comprehensive  viable and just solution unless account is taken of the legitimate aspirations and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish their own independent sovereign State. He strongly hold the view that the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all occupied territories is imperative and long overdue. We adhere to the position of principle that the acquisition of territory by force in whatever circumstances is inadmissible and can never be legitimized. We fully support the implementation of the United Nations resolutions on the Middle East  as well as the convening of an international conference with the full participation of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The gravity of the situation in our neighboring country Lebanon continues topose a serious threat to peace and security in the region. Cyprus has all alongprovided humanitarian assistance to the friendly people of Lebanon and willcontinue to do so if and when such help is needed. It is our fervent hope that thepeople of Lebanon will without further delay achieve national reconciliation andpeace and that all human suffering will be alleviated. We once again reiterate ourcontinued support for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity andunity of Lebanon and call for the immediate withdrawal of all Israeli forces from its territory.The Iran-Iraq conflict continues to cause grave loss of life  human suffering and massive destruction. We express our concern at the tragic loss of life. We also express the hope that this war may	come to an end.The problem of Western Sahara continues to remain unresolved despite many efforts including those of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). We fervently hope that a just and lasting solution will be found  based on the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the united Nations.The situation in Central America continues to pose a serious threat to peace in the region and constitutes one of the main focal points of tension. It is regrettable that  despite the efforts exerted so far by the ContaJora Group for a negotiated political solution to the problems in the region  the situation continues to deteriorate. The need for dialog is imperative. Equally imperative is respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the region and adherence to the principle of non-interference in their internal affairs. We express the hope that the peace initiatives of the Contadora Group  as well as the efforts of the Lima Support Group  will finally contribute positively to the achievement of a peaceful solution to the problems in Central America.I now turn  finally  to the grave situation we are confronted with in Cyprus  a situation with which the General Assembly and the Security Council are only too familiar. In fact  the reason why the Cyprus problem still exists is the non-implementation of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. This is an example of the weakness of our Organization which I referred to at the beginning of my statement. But if the Cyprus problem is to be properly and reasonably solved the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations constitute an absolute necessity. There is no alternative. Various attempts have been made to solve the Cyprus problem apart from the provisions of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations. Those attempts have inevitably contributed to the perpetuation of the unresolved crisis and indeed to the worsening of the situation  it is only when all efforts have been concentrated on implementing the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations that progress towards a just and lasting solution can be achieved.The elements contained in the United Nations resolutions for a solution to the Cyprus problem represent the only realistic approach. We are ourselves in the process of considering what should be done next on our part in pursuance of the implementation of the United Nations resolutions*Twelve years have gone by since the inhuman invasion of Cyprus by Turkey. Despite the condemnation of the aggression  37 per cent of our territory is still under the occupation of Turkish troops  one third of our population are still refugees  forcibly prevented from returning to their hones and ancestral lands and the missing persons are still unaccounted for  while the occupying Power persists in its calculated policy of consolidating the occupation and division of the country. Turkey still maintains an occupation array of about 30 000 men. It has implanted in the occupied part 60 000 colonist settlers from its Anatolian provinces. In fact  the Turkish Cypriot community itself is now submerged under the vocal colonist element and one of the most ominous recent developments -ominous for Cyprus and for the Turkish Cypriots themselves - is the fact that the political party which was formed by the settlers is now playing a determining role in the so-called government in the occupied area of Cyprus.The systematic large-scale implantation of colonist settlers from Turkey  in a calculated attempt to change the age-long demographic character of Cyprus  in addition to the presence of the Turkish troops of occupation and the solution Turkey envisages  is a manifest attempt by Turkey to place our country under its permanent political and military control. Throughout this period Turkey has been taking a series of partitionist steps  culminating in the blatant attempt in 1983 at secession  which was condemned by the United Nations in Security Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984).Neither Security Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984)  calling for the reversal of all secessionist acts  nor the other resolutions of the Security Council and of the General Assembly calling for the withdrawal of the occupation troops  for respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment of Cyprus  calling for the return of the refugees to their homes  condemning the influx into the occupied areas of colonialist settlers from Turkey  and calling for the cessation of foreign intervention in the internal affairs ofCyprus  have been respected by Turkey.Turkey has been able to ignore with impunity every principle and norm of justice and morality. Turkey felt itself in a position to ignore completely the General Assembly and the Security Council. It is obvious that  free from any real pressure  Turkey has not so far felt the necessity to give up its expansionist and partitionist plans against the small  defenseless and non-aligned Republic of Cyprus.Occasionally an attempt is made by some to present the Cyprus problem as a dispute between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriote Nothing could be further from the truth. The problem of Cyprus in its essence is a problem of invasion and occupation  aimed at the imposition of a solution that will serve the expansionist designs and other interests of Turkey in the region. There may be internal differences to be settled between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots. I am convinced  however  that those differences would have been solved many years ago had it not been for the presence of the occupation troops and the foreign intervention.Despite the oppressive presence of the Turkish occupation troops and settlers  which makes a mockery of ""free negotiations"" as provided for in the landmark General Assembly resolution 32/15  we have not refused to negotiate. We have been negotiating for the past 12 years  under duress and under all sorts of pressures. In our genuine desire to reach a peaceful solution we have made a series of concessions  to an extent to which no other Government  I believe  would ever have gone in similar circumstances. In fact if the concessions we have offered in connection with the constitutional and territorial aspects of the Cyprus problem were applied to other States having ethnic minorities with separatist inclinations a large number of States would be confronted with permanent instability and even complete disintegration  yet all the concessions we have offered  aside from such internationally recognized and accepted democratic principles as ""majority rule"" and ""one man one vote""  have not been considered enough. Turkey now wants us to make further concessions  to such a point that it would mean the legalization of the results of the invasion and a prescription for new deadlocks and conflicts  with repercussions beyond Cyprus.I have to be frank. Unfortunately  the mentality prevailing in certain quarters  which we very much resent  is that pressure must be exercised on the victim  being the weaker side  and not on the stronger party  namely  Turkey  irrespective of the fact that it is the aggressor and the wrongdoer. Some consider this more practical. They consider a solution easier through continuous concessions on the part of the weak side  irrespective of the merits of the case or the principles and moral issues involved. But even if we suppose that this attitude prevails and succeeds  the net result would not be a just and viable solution  but  instead  the beginning of a new crisis with far-reaching consequences. Let me at this point make clear that despite the many difficulties we are encountering  despite our weaknesses and the different pressures  we cannot  under any circumstances  agree to a solution which will place Cyprus directly or indirectly under the military and political control of Turkey  or to a solution that because of its inequity and unworkability would lead to a new Cyprus problem  new conflicts and new tragedies. The solution must be just  viable and workable  and in full conformity with the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations.We have extended our sincere co-operation to the Secretary-General of the united Nations in the exercise of his mission of good offices  which is well defined in the resolutions of the United Nations. We have done this motivated by a genuine desire to achieve a peaceful and fair solution in strict conformity with the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations. We shall continue the dialog with the Secretary-General in the same spirit.The internal aspect of the Cyprus problem is  of course  important. We have been negotiating on the internal aspects  namely  the constitutional and territorial  for a federal system for almost 12 years. We all know where both sides stand on these issues. But we do not know where the Turkish side stands with regard to the basic issue of the withdrawal of the occupation troops and thesettlers  the question of international guarantees and the question of the application of fundamental freedoms and human rights for all Cypriots.In a letter I addressed to the Secretary-General on 10 June 1986  I explained to him our position with regard to his latest initiative ' and I suggested to himhow we might proceed forward. Progress cannot be made by demanding more and moreconcessions from one side to the point that an arrangement will be both totallyunjust and unworkable  in fact  all the concessions we made in the past  which  Irepeat  no other Government in our position  in my humble view  would have made were contingent upon acceptance of the position that the subject matter of theresolutions of the United Nations relating to the withdrawal of the occupationtroops and settlers  the question of the effective international guarantees with nospurious claims of rights of unilateral interventions  and the application of thefundamental freedoms and human rights for all Cypriots  were priority questions tobe discussed and settled urgently  if agreement on these three fundamental issuesis not possible there is no point in discussing further the constitutional aspectof the problem. If  on the other hand  agreement on the three vital issues provespossible  that will facilitate an overall agreement as provided for in theresolutions of the United Nations  The way out  therefore  would be  withoutfurther delay and as a matter of priority  to tackle the important issues of the Cyprus problem.The problem of Cyprus is a problem of the United Nations  and it should besolved within its framework and in conformity with its Charter and resolutions.This has always been our position and it will continue to be so; but it is onlynatural and  I hope  understandable to expect efforts and initiatives which willpreclude the realization by Turkey of its sinister designs at the expense of Cyprusor any arrangement that might lead  because of its unworkability  to new conflicts and new crises.If progress is to be made the international community must at last find the way to make Turkey feel that it has to abandon its expansionist and partitionist plans at the expense of Cyprus. Meaningful and effective efforts towards checking Ankara's intransigence are necessary and fully consistent with the obligations of all the Members of the united Nations to ensure the implementation of its resolutions. Equally  we welcome any proposals from any side that contribute towards finding a just solution to the Cyprus problem. In this connection I wish to reiterate that we welcome the proposals made by the Soviet Union last January on the principles of a Cyprus settlement and ways to reach it. These proposals are fully consistent with the principles of the Charter and the resolutions of the united Nations. In order to address the major components of the Cyprus problem those proposals call for the convening of a representative international conference under the auspices of the United Nations. We urge all concerned to consider thissuggestion  which we fully support  seriously and urgently.It is not the first time that I address the General Assembly  and it is not the first time that I speak in this hall about the Cyprus problem. I repeatedly appealed to the General Assembly and the Security Council to take concrete steps for the implementation of the United Nations resolutions. I repeatedly appealed to all Member States to place the Cyprus problem higher on their list of priorities. For how long will the occupation of a large part of our territory continue? For how long will the refugees forcibly remain away from their homes and will the fate of the missing persons remain unknown? For how long will the people of Cyprus live in agony about their future and very survival? For how long will the human rights of our people be denied? The Cyprus problem may appear to be a complicated problem  but in its essence it is a simple one. If Turkey is made to see reason  and the resolutions of the United Nations are implemented  the Cyprus problem will be solved. Cyprus is a small island  but it has all the possibilities of being a happy place for all its inhabitants irrespective of ethnic origin. This can be achieved without the presence of occupation troops and without dividing lines. This can be achieved without foreign interference and intervention. We want peace  security and stability in Cyprus. We want freedom. We want human rights for all our citizens. Cyprus is truly a test case for the United Nations."
"38",1829,"DDR",41,1986," It was the unanimous decision of the States Members of the United Nations to proclaim 1986 the International Year of Peace. That decision has inspired millions of people. Witness to this is borne by the Soviet plan to free the world from nuclear and other means of mass destruction by the year 2000  the Soviet Union's unilateral - and several times extended -renunciation of nuclear tests  the proposals of the Warsaw Treaty States for atomic and conventional disarmament  with adequate verification  the proposals put forwardin Mexico by six Heads of State or Government and the latest initiatives taken by the non-aligned countries  at Harare. All meet with the full approval and support of the Government and people of the German Democratic Republic. The socialist German State joins hands with all for the sake of peace.Living up to its historic responsibility and aware of the dangers to which mankind is presently exposed  the German Democratic Republic is consistently engaged in the world-wide peace movement. As the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic  Erich Honecker  declared last spring at the Eleventh Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany  the socialist order in the German Democratic Republic is a guarantee that""through its policy of co-operation and businesslike dialog aimed at tangible results  the German Democratic Republic will continue to work for the normalization of the international situation and a return to detente"". Today's world is far from being a world of peace; a turn-about to greater security has not yet occurred. On the contrary  the arms race has reached a point where it threatens to get out of control. The hopes which the peoples placed on the results of the Geneva summit between the Soviet Union and the United States of America have not yet been realized.The atom has changed the world; as Albert Einstein once demanded  it must ultimately change the human mind. Wars  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  epidemics and other disasters still take their toll. But only nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction have brought mankind to the brink of self-annihilation.Nuclear weapons rule out thinking or acting art out-dated patterns  with old concepts of war  military superiority and deterrence  today's world has become too fragile to sustain a policy of strength. Security can no longer be achieved in confrontation  it can be achieved only through co-operation. Jointly with theother States of the Warsaw Treaty  the German Democratic Republic holds the viewthat only an all-embracing system of international security can provide for adurable and stable peace. These who would not agree that peoples would have beenspared untold suffering if in the 1930s proposals had been implemented to preventwar and establish a system of collective security?The proposal submitted by the socialist States to put just those issues on theagenda of the General Assembly at its forty-first session  is therefore fully inline with the goal set forth in the Charter:""To maintain international peace and security  and to that end to takeeffective collective measures ..."".An all-embracing system of international security would mean the following: all regions of the earth should be included  since a nuclear conflict would spare none of them? all spheres of State-to-State relations should be covered  since security today is far from being limited to things purely military  good political  economic  scientific and cultural relations based on sovereign equality are apt to encourage confidence and invigorate peace  and vice versa; all States  irrespective of their social order  size  alignment or non-alignment  should participate. This is the aim of the United Nations Charter which  born from historical experience  and for the very reason of preserving peace  has placed the legal equality of States above their factual inequality.The United Nations should  as stated in the letter from the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of socialist States addressed to the United Nations Secretary-General  take up the challenge of our times and adopt a fundamental document that would spell out the basic principles of the establishment of a comprehensive system of international security and provide guidance for the practical work of endowing that system with material  political  legal  moral and psychological guarantees.Not least  the German Democratic Republic would like to point to the experience gained in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe process. The Helsinki Final Act  that code of peaceful co-operation  now as before provides a stimulus to relations of peaceful coexistence beyond the region. At the Stockholm Conference it was possible to stipulate in concrete terms military confidence-building as an essential new step towards the required comprehensive renunciation of force. This is a triumph of common sense and realism as well as an expression of the mighty quest of people for making peace more secure. For the German Democratic Republic the Stockholm accord is an encouragement to continue and multiply its efforts for the cause of peace  security and detente in Europe and the world at large.The German Democratic Republic supports all efforts aimed at a relaxation of the strained international situation. Through its resolution entitled ""Need for result-oriented political dialog to improve the international situation""  which the German Democratic Republic will submit to the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly  it intends to contribute to: the political dialog and negotiations being conducted with a sense of responsibility and a desire for results that promote peace  international co-operation and accommodation of interests  and to the strengthening of the United Nations as a forum of collective efforts designed to promote arms limitation and disarmament  to develop equal international economic relations  to eliminate all forms of racism  apartheid and terrorism  and to settle other urgent world problems.The German Democratic Republic appeals to the United Nations Security Council to meet as soon as possible on a high  or preferably the highest  level to decide on measures to deal with the basic problems of safeguarding peace. Such a move would promote security and confidence  and quite certainly would help to restore predictability to international relations.For the German Democratic Republic  situated in the heart of Europe on the dividing line between the two most powerful military coalitions  it is particularly vital that all States act on their responsibility arising from their obligation to ma in ta in peace and that they assist in diminishing and finally removing the material means of war. And this is the ultimate key to the resolution of other global and regional problems - economic  social and humanitarian.In the International Year of Peace the allied socialist States have submitted an integrated Program for gradual disarmament in both the nuclear and conventional fields  including effective verification. The Program covers all types of armaments and envisages global and regional solutions  including partialones  so that faster or better progress could be made. Respect for the equality and equal security of all would continue to be the basic principle.Relations between the Soviet Onion and the United States are and remain crucial for world affairs. The German Democratic Republic would welcome the further pursuit of the political dialog begun in Geneva.A summit meeting with results - that is what States and peoples desire and need. The pr in ci pies agreed between the Soviet Oh ion and the United States in Geneva on 21 November 1985  mainly  to prevent any war between them  not to seek to achieve military superiority  that a nuclear war must never be fought because it can never be won  and to continue their political dialog - provide sound bases for the improvement of Soviet-American relations and  consequently  the international situation.The Soviet Union is offering a specific  verifiable program of disarmament. It has unilaterally forgone nuclear testing for more than a year now. By contrast  the other great nuclear Power conducts nuclear tests time and again. The German Democratic Republic associates itself with the view of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  whom I should like to wish the best of success in his endeavor  namely  that an agreement on the conclusion of a treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear tests would be a clear signal of a willingness to confront the nuclear challenge. The General Assembly should demand with all due emphasis that the unilateral moratorium be turned into action by all nuclear-weapon States in order speedily to achieve a treaty on the complete prohibition of nuclear testing.The offer made by the six statesmen in the recent Declaration from their summit in Mexico to help ensure adequate verification deserves high appreciation.Plans to carry the arras race into outer space run counter to all this. Thehistory of mankind  notably that of the two world wars  disproves the assertion that new weapon systems  whatever their form  could serve to avert wars. The credo of ""peace through strength"" has always stood for the attempt of a few profiteers to manipulate nations for war. Today  in view of the existence of nuclear weapons that threaten all life  acting according to that credo means death to all. Since no side will allow the other to gain military superiority  common sense and realism call for disarmament and nothing but disarmament.In that regard  deployment of weapons in outer space is the obstacle to the cessation of the arms race on earth. Even eloquent advocates of arms in space cannot demonstrate convincingly how the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) objective of making nuclear weapons superfluous in the first place can be attained if they have to admit  at the same time  that nuclear weapons and further nuclear tests are prerequisites for SDI. would it not be simpler  safer and more logical to renounce ""Star Wars"" and any type of nuclear weapons from the outset?We in the German Democratic Republic expect the Soviet-American negotiations to lead to accords on ways of preventing an arms race in outer space. The German Democratic Republic supports relevant multilateral negotiations at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. Peace cm earth and in space is the goal.It has been made painfully clear by accidents or human errors - such as  in connection with space travel  the Challenger disaster  with regard to nuclear power production  the Chernobyl accident and the Harrisburg accident in 1979  and  in the chemical industry  the accidents in Bophal and Seveso - that man must never lose control of what he has created. The secure future of our planet and the advances in science and technology make it essential to ensure that the weapons devised by man must never be used.General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev warned that the detonation of even the smallest nuclear warhead would release radiation of an intensity three times greater than did the Chernobyl accident. One need not be an expert to realize that the explosion of a fragment of the nuclear-weapon stockpiles would spell certain self-destruction for mankind. Even at the present level of weaponry  it will take the highest-level scientific achievements - indeed  all of human genius - to devise ways and means of liquidating the existing weapons of mass destruction without risk to mankind. Every new weapon makes that challenge even more difficult.The German Democratic Republic fully supports the proposals of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for the establishment of a world space organization and an international.regime for the safe use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and the control of that energy.Like the great majority of States  the German Democratic Republic is of the view that verification must not serve as a pretext for blocking concrete disarmament steps. It is not verification of the arms build-up that is needed  however; verification must be a constituent part of all arms limitation and disarmament.With each passing day  the peoples are realizing more clearly from experience direct link between super-armament and underdevelopment and  consequently  betweendisarmament and social progress. The magnitude of the material and intellectual resources squandered for armament purposes is indeed unparalleled. If that trend were to be checked  immense sums would become available for combating underdevelopment  hunger and poverty. The German Democratic Republic deplores the fact that the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which was to have addressed those vital issues  was not convened as planned.Where debt is concerned  the developing countries have a heavy burden to carry  brought about by an accumulation of political  economic and social problems. The German Democratic Republic supports and will continue to support an early and equitable settlement of that problem  as well as the practical proposals submitted by the Group of 77 at the fortieth session of the General Assembly.As a European State  the German Democratic Republic has an overriding interest in cutting down the weapons stockpiles heaped up on the continent and in preventing the creation of new ones. No European can feel safer with the missiles deployed. Even before the deployment of those weapons  Erich Honecker  Head of State of the German Democratic Republic  urged: ""Stop that devilish stuff."" Further  the German Democratic Republic regards as most timely the creation of a corridor free of battlefield nuclear weapons along the border between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and the Warsaw Treaty countries - a task to which the Swedish statesman the late Olof Palme devoted his life.Europe is the continent with the highest concentration of warfare capabilities. It is the region where the two major alliances and social systems are confronting each other  and it is particularly vulnerable. There  not even the smallest flare-up must be allowed  for that would be the beginning of mankind's end. The establishment in Europe of a zone free of chemical weapons would beconducive to regional security and to the early conclusion of a world-wide ban on chemical weapons. For that purpose  the Governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic have proposed to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany the principles and main guidelines for negotiations between those three States on the establishment of a such a zone. Other states have also indicated their interest. Regional and global solutions are certainly not mutually exclusive. There is no reason why we should not seek the one while not abandoning the other.The German Democratic Republic attaches immense importance to the Vienna follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in promoting propitious State-to-State co-operation. What the world needs is an environment in which peaceful work can succeed. As was underlined in the joint statement issued by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic  Erich Honecker  and the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  Helmut Kohl  on 12 March 1985  the inviolability of frontiers and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all States in Europe within their present borders is a fundamental pre-condition of peace. Those principles must not be shaken.This also implies desisting from taking part in new arms build-ups. To do otherwise would be in no way consistent with the general obligation to promote peace. That obligation includes for the two German States a duty to develop their mutual relations in such way as to serve detente and disarmament.The German Democratic Republic acts in conformity with its highest policy precept  which is to do everything to ensure that no further war  but only peace  shall ever emanate from German soil.European post-war developments have corroborated the fact that unqualified respect for the existence of two German States  sovereign and independent of one another  and normal relations between them on the basis of international law are crucial conditions of peace on the continent.In a world in which the security and survival of mankind can only be ensured through co-operation  a just and lasting settlement of international conflicts cannot be postponed. The German Democratic Republic supports the convening of an international Middle East conference  with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  as well as the establishment of a preparatory committee composed of the five permanent members of the Security Council  as proposed by the Soviet Union.Aggressive onslaughts in pursuit of State terrorism highlight the need to stabilize the situation in the Mediterranean and ensure respect for the right of all States and peoples to develop their society and way of life without any interference.The German Democratic Republic invariably supports Cyprus in its just struggle for national independence and territorial integrity.The inhuman regime of apartheid must be eliminated once and for all and Namibia must immediately be granted independence. South Africa's policy is no longer merely an obstacle to the development of the African peoples: it has become an acute danger to world peace.The situation in Central America is alarming. Policies of terror  outside intervention  dollar injections for contras  all prevent the peoples of the region from exercising their right to self-determination. The German Democratic Republic demands an instant end to the undeclared war against Nicaragua and to support for the counter-revolutionary gangs. It pays a sincere tribute to Nicaragua's prudentpolicy and welcomes the endeavors of the Contadora Group and its Support Group to bring about a peaceful settlement of the conflict.The German Democratic Republic strongly endorses the efforts to bring about a political solution of the situation that has emerged around Afghanistan.Our country is sympathetic towards the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for an improvement of the situation on the Korean peninsula  including plans to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone there.The proposals made by the States of Indochina in July of this year require a constructive response in the interest of peace in South-East Asia.The German Democratic Republic favors economic relations that are based on equality and free of discrimination. It pleads for utilization of the possibilities of the world Organization as regards an international economic order that would guarantee all States equal economic security. It would be timely to prepare  within the framework of the United Nations  a global Program on international co-operation in the fields of science and technology.During the International Year of Peace  the fact that the right to peace is the determinant human right deserves special mention.The twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the two human rights Covenants should be an occasion to conduct human rights activities more extensively  in keeping with the United Nations Charter. Both past experience and current requirements indicate the need for intensified action against systematic mass violations of human rights and neo-fascist tendencies.The year 1986 should witness a new departure in the coexistence of States and peoples. It should be a year of efforts to contain the arms race and gradually to settle international conflicts. Experience shows that the United Nations has been and can be successful only to the extent that its Member States are ready to act along those lines.To banish the threat of a nuclear inferno once and for all  to replace the terrifying vision of Star Wars by a well-founded prospect of lasting peace on earth - these are challenges that still call for greater and  above all  common efforts.From this rostrum the German Democratic Republic reaffirms its will to do everything  within the United Nations and in all its international activities  that will help preserve mankind's life in peace."
"39",1847,"DEU",41,1986,"In this autumn of 1986  the community of nations is again facing serious problem* and momentous decisions that affect the destiny of our peoples.We are threatened by embroilment in hostilities as well as by famine and misery. Dangers threaten international economic and financial co-operation. The dignity of man is being violated in a thousand ways. Wars are taking place in many parts of the world. In the Republic of South Africa there is a threat of civil war. Natural disasters are compounded by man-made disasters with far-reachingeffects that transcend national boundaries.But we see hopeful signs also. In Europe co-operation across the ideological boundaries is developing into a strong force for the preservation of peace. Negotiations between West and East on confidence-building and disarmament are being conducted in unprecedented depth. Encouraging progress has been registered. New negotiations are being prepared. Throughout the world the hand of those who seek co-operation instead of confrontation is becoming stronger. More and more people realize that we have become a community in pursuit of survival. There is a prevailing awareness that the survival of mankind requires co-operative solutions -for the prevention of war  for the protection of our ecological basis  for the new technological developments  for the peaceful use of the sea-bed and the peaceful use of outer space  for the fight against famine and disease  for solutions to international economic problems  including that of indebtedness. The peoples of the world want their Governments to recognize these signs.The quest for superiority and hegemony  the quest for unilateral advantages the exploitation of political  military and economic power  the attempt to bringothers to their knees  the attempt to force one's own social order on others: allthese are outdated aspirations. Again and again they have dragged mankind intocatastrophe. The peoples of the world are no longer prepared to tolerate such policies.My country  the Federal Republic of Germany  is on the side of progress co-operation  human rights  self-determination and peace. We regard man  in hisunalterable dignity  in his uniqueness and in his freedom  as the focus of allaction. Those values are the cornerstone of the alliance between democraticEurope  the United States and Canada.The President of this session of the General Assembly himself comes from acountry that has sought international co-operation time and again to overcomedifficult economic problems. I wish him and the United Nations good fortune andsuccess.I should like thank Mr. Perez de Cuellar for his excellent work  his wise decisions and his sensible initiatives as Secretary-General of the united Nations.The 12 States members of the European Community  on their way towards European union and a common foreign policy  are speaking here from a common position. As representative of the Chairman of the Community  Sir Geoffrey Howe has spoken for all of us. Going on from there  I shall outline the views of the Federal Republic of Germany  which has irrevocably committed its destiny to that of Europe and whichis a firmly established member of the Western Alliance.Europe  so often torn by wars in the course of its history  a continent from which conquest  force and repression have spread to all parts of the world  today's Europe wishes to be a continent of peace and an example of good-neighborly relations. The peoples of the European Community - first and foremost the Germans and the French - have shown that it is possible to replace centuries-old rivalry and deadly conflict with friendship and to grow together into a union of equals.However  Europe is more than the Community of the Twelve. After all  Europe does not end at the Elbe and Werra Rivers. Hence  in taking our decisions we never forget that there are also Germans and Europeans to the east of us. As a nation in the center of Europe  we consider it our historical duty as Germans to defuse and eventually surmount the antithesis between East and West. We should be bad Germans and bad Europeans were we to do otherwise. That is why  during the 1970s  we put relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and its eastern neighbors on a new contractual basis  a basis that remains an unshakable cornerstone of our policy. Conscious of the course of history  we seek steady development of German-Soviet co-operation  which is an essential prerequisite for a realistic policy of European detente.We shall consistently pursue the process of German-Polish reconciliation  we seek a peaceful modus vivendi in the whole of Europe based on co-operation and mutual trust. An ever-more important role in this effort falls to the two German States by virtue of the 1972 Treaty cm the Basis of Relations. We Europeans must develop and design our European home  which comprises Europe in its entirety  as a place fit to live in. We must not continue to accept the enormous commitment of resources and energies to the conflict between West and East.If today Europeans are becoming more fully aware of their common identity and seeking to live peacefully in their common home  the doors in that home must be opened much wider. This means that it must not be a capital offense to pass through those doors from one part of the home to the other  we must rid borders of their awesome and divisive character  thereby enabling States with varying social systems to pursue their common and complementary interests and their responsibility for their common future in peaceful competition  so that their peoples no longer live in fear of each other but can get to know one another. The Europeans must  through a gradual process of reducing conflict potential and of fostering co-operation  elevate their relations to new forms  what we seek is a peaceful order in Europe based on the equality of all and on equal entitlement to security.We seek a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will regain its unity through free self-determination.The defusing of the East-West antithesis depends greatly on the development of relations between the two super-Powers. For that reason  it is important that the second summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev should take place before the end of this year.United States-Soviet nuclear and space negotiations must lead to positive results. The negotiating objective agreed upon by both parties in Geneva on 8 January 1985 to prevent an arms race in space and terminate it on earth has become an obligation towards all the peoples of the world. That obligation must be honored without reservation.We attach particular importance to the negotiations on the American and Soviet intermediate-range missile systems. In recent months progress and rapprochement have been achieved in that field. We desire the global elimination of all American and Soviet land-based intermediate-range nuclear force of longer range. If that aim cannot be fulfilled in one step  we should like to see an interim result which leaves the lowest possible number of missiles cm both sides and sets equal ceilings on a global scale and for Europe.We want the arms spiral finally to be reversed. We Germans will bring all our influence to bear to help negotiations to that end to an early result. We also desire drastic reductions in strategic nuclear potentials. The relationship between offensive and defensive weapons must be discussed in its proper context  as was agreed on 8 January 1985.We consider it necessary that the provisions of the SALT II agreement continue to be observed and that the 1972 Treaty on the Limitation of An ti-Ball is tic Missile Systems be adhered to until the establishment of a new contractual basis.Last weekend the 35 States participating in the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe adopted a final document. That document is a signal of hope. The Conference derived from a Franco-German initiative. At the beginning of this year the joint appearance of the French and German Foreign Ministers injected a fresh impetus. Its success is a triumph for common sense  responsibility and sound judgment. The measures agreed upon will apply to the whole of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals. They will make the military behavior of the participating States more calculable  thereby helping to reduce distrust. They can facilitate progress at the Vienna mutual and balanced force reduction negotiations and  above all  initiate negotiations on conventional stability in the area between the Atlantic and the Urals. There are also too many conventional arms in Europe  and there is an imbalance to our detriment.The offer of negotiations made by the Halifax meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Foreign Ministers still stands. The Warsaw Pact has responded favorably. Action must be taken before this year is over. The aim of future negotiations must be to create a situation in which the size of the forces of both sides is determined solely by defensive requirements. On our side this is already the case. We must never forget that even a war waged with conventional arms alone would in today's Europe be a thousand times more horrific than the Second World War and would amount to multiple genocide in Europe.Negotiations on the world-wide prohibition of chemical weapons have reached the stage at which it is possible for the community of nations as a whole to be freed from the scourge of chemical weapons. There is no longer any reason to delay an agreement.In the important issue of a nuclear test ban  too  progress is possible. Stable and lasting peace requires co-operative structures in all areas. Apart from confidence-building and disarmament  this implies the establishment of an ordered system of political interaction as well as the broadest possible economic  technological  environmental and cultural co-operation. Peoples must have a part in exchanges and co-operation and be permitted to exercise the rights set forth inthe Helsinki Final Act.We in Europe are endeavoring to bring about such a development within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  whose key elements are security and co-operation. The participation of the United States and Canada in that process corresponds to the reality of the security situation in Europe. The multilateral nature of the process gives all Europeans in Western  Eastern  neutral and non-aligned countries the opportunity to help build the Europe of the future  in which all States  irrespective of their social systems  will determine their own fate and their engagement in co-operation with their neighbors.The follow-up meeting in Vienna to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  due to be opened at ministerial level in November  must point the way towards a peaceful order in Europe.We seek a mandate for the continuation and expansion of the negotiations on confidence-building measures and disarmament in the whole of Europe on the basis of the encouraging results in Stockholm. We must take co-operative steps towards the establishment of more stable security structures in the conventional sphere.In the field of economic co-operation  we seek greater transparency of markets  more exchanges and division of labor  and new forms of co-operation.Everyone will benefit if the latest reactor-safety and environmental technology becomes accessible to all countries.Chernobyl was a warning signal.Isolationism and trade wars are of no use to mankind; exchanges and co-operation are the way to accomplish common tasks  to increase the prosperity of all and to ward off dangers. Co-operative solutions to security issues will further extend the basis of trust  to the benefit of economic and technological co-operation.We want human rights to be respected*  we seek more contacts and improved opportunities for human encounter  we seek even more youth exchanges  educational co-operation and progress in the field of information.At this very moment there are real prospects of substantial progress  both in the relations and negotiations between the two super-Powers and in the multilateral process of detente  progress that will lead to a new end more lasting phase of fruitful relations between West and East. Tangible progress in Europe serves to promote development  security and stability throughout the world.The European Community is already shouldering its responsibility for co-operation in the development of the third world. We do this without ambitions for political power and without wishing to impose our social model on others or to establish spheres of influence. We seek a world in which self-determination  social justice  human rights and fundamental freedoms are the paramount principles of interaction among all peoples.International terrorism  the scourge of mankind  is directed against peaceful interaction among nations  the right to live and human dignity. It is the common task of the community of nations to fight this evil. The decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council are an encouraging sign that awareness of this task is growing.The continually worsening international refugee problem is a symptom of grave injustice in some parts of the world. The recommendations deriving from the discussion of the refugee initiative that I introduced in the General Assembly six years ago must lead to an improvement in international co-operation in this area. We hope that this session of the General Assembly will adopt by consensus the recommendations made by the Group of Experts.Respect for the right of self-determination and respect for human rights are absolutely essential if peace is to be safeguarded. There is a direct path leading from the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights through the two covenants on human rights to the prohibition of torture. By adopting the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  the community of nations has reaffirmed its desire to combat systematically this particularly abhorrent form of violation of human rights . The next step should be the prevention of arbitrary executions. He shall continue to support the abolition of the death penalty.Two years from now  in 1988  40 years will have passed since the united Nations in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights took the vital pioneering step to embed human rights in international law. The United Nations needs institutions that will guarantee better protection of human rights. To this end  the appointment of a high commissioner for human rights is just as indispensable as the creation of a United Nations court of human rights. By such actions we could lend real significance to the year 1988. The persecuted and the suffering await a decisive and effective step on the part of the international community^We roust not remain silent with regard to serious violations of human rights. If we find something intolerable  we have a duty to say so. Today this applies particularly to the inhumane and immoral system of apartheid  the systematic form of racial discrimination and segregation. The state of emergency in the Republic of South Africa has bred arbitrary and lawless action. An increasing death toll is the horrific outcome of a policy directed against people who wish only to live in their own country and to enjoy equal rights and freedom from discrimination. If the inhumane system of apartheid is not eliminated  the inevitable consequence will be even more violence  even more bloodshed and ultimately chaos and civil war.Just as inhumanity cannot be reformed but only eliminated  apartheid is notreformable and must therefore be abolished.We demand the immediate initiation of dialog among the authentic representatives of all sections of the population and are preparing an initiative with that aim. We demand the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners. We demand that the ban on the African National Congress and other political groups be lifted. We demand the termination of the state of emergency. The measures adopted by the European Community on 16 September 1986 lend emphasis to this political demand.The internal tension generated by apartheid in South Africa reverberates through the entire region and is exacerbated by the South African policy of destabilizing its neighbors. This situation is further aggravated by the continuing illegal occupation of Namibia  whose people are denied their independence and their right of self-determination. The Federal Republic of Germany will not waver in its support for the earliest possible establishment of Namibian independence on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  as called for by the General Assembly at its fourteenth special session. There is no alternative to the United Nations proposed settlement as outlined in resolution 435 (1978).The eighth summit conference of the non-aligned countries at Harare provided further evidence that genuine non-alignment is an important factor for peace and stability in inter national relations. We support the call addressed to the warring States of Iran and Iraq to put an end to the bloodshed in the Gulf region. We support the call made by the summit conference for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and Cambodia. In Afghanistan  as in Cambodia  the right of peoples to self-determination must be realized.In the same way  we advocate the right of the Palestinian people to exercise self-determination and to decide on their own future. This must come about within the framework of a peace settlement for the Middle East that guarantees all countries of the region  including Israel  safe and recognized boundaries and hence a secure existence as States.We appeal to the regional groupings in all parts of the world to render their contribution to international stability.We also need co-operative approaches to solve international economic problems and to align the international economic system with the needs of tomorrow. My country regards development co-operation between North and South as a central pillar of its policy in pursuit of peace. This is demonstrated by the rate at which our official aid has increased-  in 1985 its growth of 9 per cent far exceeded the growth of our gross national product. At the same time  our help is directed to areas where the need is greatest-  for that reason  the share of our aid devoted to Africa has been raised from 37 to 47 per cent. The Federal Government will also give its most vigorous support to the ProgramF of Action adopted at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa. We know that our world is facing a common fate  and we act accordingly. Our aim is a system of world-wide co-operation based on partnership and awareness of the interdependence of nations  in which private initiative and autonomous efforts have their place.The first and elementary goal of development co-operation must be to free the world from hunger. To this and  we must enable farmers in all parts of the third world to produce enough food for themselves and for their domestic markets. In most of the developing countries rapid agricultural growth can prove to be a locomotive for national economies. All the aid devoted to rural development can bear fruit  however  only if the industrialized countries do not engage in ruinous competition with third-world food producers by subsidizing their own products. A stop must be put to the world-wide dumping of agricultural products.We have managed so far to keep the problems of indebtedness under control by means of a co-operative strategy  but the crisis of indebtedness itself remains unresolved. It continues to pose a political challenge  but if it is to be overcome the international financial institutions  the governments of creditor countries and the private banks must play their part. Capital must at last begin to fl<w again from North to South instead of financing budgetary deficits in industrialized countries. It is of central importance that the private transfer of capital should be set in motion again. For this reason  the Federal Government has signed the Convention on the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency  which can become an effective means of attaining that goal. However  the indebted countries must also act. They must create conditions which will restore the confidence of domestic as well as foreign investors in the future of their countries. Only thus can the flight of capital be halted.Another crucial task is that of revitalizing the international free trade system. The Punta del Este agreement on the opening of a new round of trade liberalization is an encouraging sign. We must strengthen and develop the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We must prime radically the proliferation of agreements on voluntary restrictions; we must thin out the jungle of agricultural subsidies*  we must modernize GATT  and that means gradually incorporating services and foreign investments into the GATT system.In an increasingly close-woven international economy  economic policies can no longer exist in isolation. Each country must see and consider the effects of its own economic policy on other countries. Here  too  co-operation and solidarity are called for. The greater a country  the greater is its economic responsibility to the rest of the world.To establish the world-wide co-operative structures that will enable us to master our common future  we need a comprehensive dialog between industrialized and developing countries. I therefore consider it urgently necessary that we should at last inject new life into the North-South dialog and that we should orient that dialog towards the major issues affecting the future  thereby making it a potent factor in international politics and economics. In 1975  which is already 11 years ago now  as we took the first steps towards a large-scale North-South dialog  our thinking was determined by the study drawn up by the Club of Rome on the limits to growth. Shortages of energy  raw materials and foodstuffs  limits on the tolerance of the environment  seemed to be the law that would determine the future of the world. But we are beginning to sense that sane thing completely different is taking places a new technological revolution  which is establishing new and wider horizons for growth. New forms of technology -space technology  information technology and gene technology - permit a new type of growth that conserves energy and raw materials and which protects  indeed heals  the environment. This departure from the industrial age into a new era is not by any means peculiar to the Western countries but is a world-wide phenomenon. The new forms of technology can also bring decisive benefits to the developing countries in particular.The potential of gene technology is immense. Let us remember that in the sixties high-yield varieties of rice and wheat led to the green revolution. India  which had hitherto been an importer of grain  became self-sufficient and even began to export grain. The new varieties were produced in the traditional manner by cross-breeding. Gene technology now offers far quicker and more effective ways of cultivating ""made-to-order"" plants  which are resistant to disease  can withstand drought and cold  can grow in over-saline soil and are rich in protein  and plants which breathe in nitrogen from the air  thereby relieving farmers of the need to buy expensive fertilizers.A second green revolution seems set to take place in the nineties  its effects far exceeding those of the first. Above all  it will include regions hitherto at a disadvantage and be of great importance to arid zones such as the Sahel. Major improvements can also be expected in livestock breeding. Then there are the opportunities that gene technology opens up for medicine. For example  it gives us reason to hope that we can develop vaccines against tropical diseases that are at present incurable.Great and new though the opportunities deriving from these new forms of technology may be  the risks associated with them are equally great and new. Gene-technology in particular raises issues of immense importance  since it gives man unprecedented power to interfere with the hereditary genes of living creatures.The accident in the Chernobyl reactor brought home to us overnight how the task of mastering safely the risks of high technology has become a common responsibility  one that welds the nations of the world into a community in pursuit of survival. In Vienna the special International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meeting on reactor safety has just begun. We hope that it will set negotiations in motion which will lead to universally binding safety standards and an international liability law. It is significant that that conference should take place under United Nations auspices  for the United Nations has become the indispensable forum for dealing with the issues that will determine our global future.We must not  however  accept nuclear energy as the final answer to man's energy requirements? here  too  we must jointly seek new answers. The protection of the environment cannot today be guaranteed by an individual State when it relies on its own resources. Radioactivity  as we have seen  does not stop at national boundaries  nor do air and water pollution. It follows that environmental protection is no longer an affair to be dealt with by each individual State as it sees fit.For thousands of years the inroads made by human technology into nature seemed so minimal that their overall impact could be disregarded. Nature appeared indestructible and inexhaustible. It is now realized  however  that technology has assumed dimensions that threaten to destroy the ecological balance of nature. We are living today with the shock of that discovery. Nothing is the same any more. International environmental policy has become a vital task. It is a safeguard for the future  a course of action dictated by our responsibility to future generations. In this field  we are confronted by fundamental tasks under theheading of international domestic policy  a term which implies the need to acttogether.Those few references alone demonstrate the challenge facing all of us in this new technological revolution. What must be done - and here let me cite the Secretary-General's report to our Assembly - is;""to manage safely  and to common advantage  the inventions of the human mind"".We need a North-South dialog that devotes itself to those new questions. It must be a dialog that takes as its starting point the immense structural upheaval currently taking place in the world and faces up to it in a courageous and forward-looking manner. What is needed is a global policy in which the problems of mankind are understood as tasks for mankind. Mankind  which has become a community in quest of survival  must recognize its responsibility to its contemporaries as well as to all future generations.The United Nations is the forum where this policy must be discussed. This development must take place with due regard for the identity of all peoples  which have all made unique contributions to human history and to the civilizations of the world. Respect for others also entails respect for their cultural identity. Our international Organization must therefore promote a world-wide cultural dialog that sill prevent the submersion of native cultures by foreign influences and highlight the variety of cultural achievements for the benefit of all.I have again stated the case for world-wide co-operation in a spirit of mutual confidence to resolve the major international issues facing us. To this end we need the United Nations as a sound international Organization  as the forum where openness prevails and as an indispensable negotiating framework. It draws its strength not least from its universality. That is why all peoples  including the Korean people  should be represented here. We must do everything possible to maintain the effectiveness of the United Nations. To this end  it is necessary for us  the Member States  to observe fully the obligations deriving from the Charter. It is also necessary for this session of the General Assembly to achieve positive results in its discussion of measures to increase the efficiency of the United Nations  based on the report of the 18 experts.My Government supports the views outlined by the Secretary-General in his report on the role of the United Nations in international relations and the structural reforms needed to strengthen the Organization. My delegation welcomes the fact that the President has so clearly defined the operative objectives of the reforr process. The United Nations needs reforms to remain strong and effective. For our part  we need a strong and effective United Nations so that through our co-operation here in the Organization the survival of mankind may be assured."
"40",1885,"DJI",41,1986,"I an very pleased to congratulate you most sincerely. Sir  on your election as President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. Your well-deserved election to this high post  while a tribute to your great country  with which my own has excellent relations  also bears clear witness to your personal dualities as a seasoned diplomat. Your inexhaustible knowledge and vast experience will be an indispensable factor in successfully guiding our deliberations at this session to fruitful results. Let me assure you that my delegation will always be ready to co-operate actively with you in your efforts to discharge the heavy responsibilities entrusted to you.Allow me also to take this opportunity to express my delegation's appreciation and gratitude to your predecessor  Ambassador de Pinies of Spain  who  in presiding over the last General Assembly session  showed the competence and devotion that are characteristic of an able and experienced diplomat.I am also pleased to pay my tribute to the United Nations Secretary-General? Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the untiring efforts he is exerting in promoting and advancing the purposes and principles for the attainment of which the United Nations was founded.We have come here once more to exchange views and focus our attention and co-operation on important national and international issues whose solution are so vital to the promotion of international peace and security.We live in a world where three quarters of the population suffers from extreme economic difficulties and social maladjustments. Half of this population is so poor and destitute that there is little hope for it to overcome its misery. It isnot therefore difficult to understand that the overwhelming majority of the world's population has found it very hard to accept a world order in which the scientific and modern technological advances and achievements benefit only the few and where the gap between the developed and developing nation is widening so much that global peace and security are endangered.Last year when we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  we came up with the inspiring motto of ""The United Nations for a Better World"". Every one of us knew then that we needed better negotiations for a better world. Unfortunately  since the beginning of the global negotiations in 1979 no negotiations between the North and South have succeeded in finding remedies or solutions to the social and economic imbalances that plague our planet today. As a result  the economic situation in the developing countries  and especially in the least developed among them  has deteriorated drastically  thus making the third-world communities so vulnerable to the extreme dangers of man-made and natural disasters.The plight of the African continent has been debated at many international forums  because Africa has been the victim of one crisis after another for many years. Severe drought has afflicted many countries; it has subsided temporarily -although there are many lingering effects - but it has caused incalculable damage to the environment and ecology and set in motion a chain of irreparable destruction to both plant and animal life.Most alarming in the African continent is the precarious food situation resulting from crop failures. That has been compounded by persistent and prolonged drought that has devoured both plant and animal life  thus seriously affecting the livelihood of masses of the population  causing chronic hunger and malnutrition in many parts of Africa and leading to famine in other parts.The African continent  faced with impending economic and social crisis  had to commit itself to the launching of a long-term programmer of economic and social development. This African commitment  coupled with the good will of the international community  prompted the General Assembly to adopt resolution 40/40 of 2 December 1985  calling for the convening  from 27 to 31 May this year  of a special session of the General Assembly at the ministerial level to consider in depth the critical economic situation in Africa and to focus on it the international attention it deserved.We were gratified to note the commendable efforts that were made to ensure the necessary international good will and the commitment to support the efforts to alleviate the crisis situation by co-operating with the African Governments on a bilateral and a multilateral basis - as envisaged in the African Priority program for Economic Recovery  1986-1990 and the Program of Action for African Economic Recovery aid Development  1986-1990. We appreciate the willingness of the international community to contribute to the economic rehabilitation and development program for Africa - though the extent to which the implementation of this program will be supported remains to be seen.The African continent is endowed with abundant agricultural  animal  mineral and water resources and has a great potential for human-resources development  which  in pursuance of the Lagos Plan of Action and the Lagos Final Act  is to be given a high priori.It is very important that the attainment of self-sufficiency in food production in the African continent be made one of the priority targets  in order to alleviate the constantly worsening food crisis. Both the agricultural and the industrial sectors should be developed in an integrated manner and should be accompanied by the development and the improvement of an adequate transport and communication system. Significant and serious investment in multifarious institutions for manpower training  energy resources and material development is needed to increase the chances of improving social services in education  health  hygiene  housing and employment. It goes without saying that African countries need to promote interregional co-operation in all fields that are deemed necessary for their economic  social and political survival.The East African countries of Djibouti  Ethiopia  Kenya  Somalia  the Sudan and Uganda  reaffirming their common desire to combine their efforts in confronting the dangerous effects of drought and other related natural disasters have  in conformity with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 35/90 and subsequent relevant resolutions  established the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) and adopted a Plan of Action to promote the specific programs and projects needed to strengthen those countries' national and regional capacities to combat the effects of drought and promote economic and social development. The necessary arrangements have been finalized for the IGADD Authority to carry out its responsibility of co-ordinating and supporting the efforts of the IGADD countries to combat the effects of drought and to deal with the problems of medium- and long-term recovery and rehabilitation.Confronting recurrent drought and its ramifications is a formidable challenge which cannot be easily overcome without the development of suitable and sound programs for recovery and rehabilitation. These programs cannot be successful without the full support of the international community for the IGADD countries so that they can cope effectively with the difficult task of resolving drought problems in the region.It is for this reason that the countries of IGADD reiterate their appeal to the international community for support  and wish to invite the donor countries to a pledging conference to be held in Djibouti in March next year.May I at this point express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to all those Member States  agencies and organizations that have assisted the countries of IGADD in their efforts to establish the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought andDevelopment.The nations of the Horn of Africa have always attached great importance to the development of active regional co-operation among themselves. He believe that the establishment and maintenance of intergovernmental agencies and organizations will help to create conditions conducive to greater tolerance  mutual understanding and good-neighborliness and thus lead to the development of meaningful co-operation in the improvement of trade  commerce  cultural exchange and tourism. We also believe that such co-operation will help to create a climate of trust in which our differences can be accommodated and more mutual respect and understanding can be created in order to benefit all the people of the region.The Republic of Djibouti is situated in one of the most arid regions in the world and the scarcity and irregularity of rainfall are impediments to undertaking any meaningful agricultural development. Although there is the possibility of exploiting underground water  it will require a considerable amount of financial resources and technical expertise. Although self-sufficiency in food is a desirable goal  the climatic conditions an^ non-agricultural tradition of the inhabitants are the main obstacles to agricultural development.Livestock had been the principal livelihood of the population before the development of urban centers However  the overgrazing of pastoral land and the recurrent drought have brought about an environmental change which means thatlivestock rearing is no longer a viable means of subsistence. Consequently the rural population has become more and more dependent on urban centers for their sustenance.£s a result of such impediments to agricultural production and livestock rearing  Djibouti is a net importer of almost all the food needed for local consumption.In the industrial sector  the country lacks raw materials and electric power is too expensive to be a source of energy for industrialization. The development of new and renewable sources of energy could lay the basis for meaningful industrial development. In this regard  we have accorded priority to the exploitation of geothermal energy  which is believed to exist in sufficient quantity to provide for a substantial part of the energy needs of the country. But the exploitation of geothermal energy requires technology  capital investment and skilled professional manpower.In these circumstances  it is appropriate to accord priority to the development and expansion of the service sector  which constitutes the basis of the country's economy. But this also will require structural adjustment  vocational training and improvement in the quality of services  which in turn will depend on the availability of the financial resources which Djibouti cannot provide.At present  the country has to cope with difficult economic and financial problems resulting from multiple adverse factors  such as external debt  inflation  unemployment  the effects of the last drought and the presence of a considerable number of refugees from the neighboring areas.The Palestinian question and its direct consequence  the situation in the Middle East  have for the last four decades been the main concern of the international community as a source of potential threat to international peace and security. As long as the Zionist aggressors continue to occupy Palestinian and other Arab lands and persist in their denial of Palestinian rights in defiance of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the principles of international law  the Middle East will continue to be the powder keg that could blow up at ar.y time  with incalculable consequences for international peace and security. Every attempt by the United Nations to find a just and lasting solution to this problem has been flouted by the Zionist expansionists  who perceived the United Nations partition plan  creating one Arab Palestinian and one Jewish State  as nothing more than a bridgehead to be used as a base for future expansionist aggressions.As subsequent events have demonstrated  Israel's declared policy has become the non-recognition not only of Palestinian national rights but also of the existence of the Palestinians as a people  in an attempt to alienate them from the land on which they have lived since time immemorial. Israel's declaration of independence signified  at the same time  a declaration of war on the Palestinian Arab people. The political motivation behind the cold blooded massacre of the civilian population  including women and children  at Deir Yassin  perpetrated by Zionist gangs  was to terrorize the inhabitants into panic and cause them to flee the country. Those dangerous developments led to armed conflicts that have five times plunged the region into bloody destructive wars  each time threatening international peace and security.The continuing occupation of the Palestinian and other Arab territories by Israel and the concomitant oppression and repression of the inhabitants by the occupying authorities in their drive to accelerate the process of colonization and Judaization  have become an expansionist strategy to force the Arab inhabitants into exile so as to make a place for the Jewish immigrants coming from all over the world.The Palestinian people have suffered for a long tine  unless the United Nations  which bears direct responsibility  responds urgently to their plight  the mounting hostilities will widen into a global conflagration. Sporadic acts of violence and outrage can be eradicated only if the international community addresses itself decisively to the root causes  which are none other them the denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  and the Zionist expansionist policy. Since this year has been dedicated by the General Assembly as the International Year of Peace  it would be appropriate for the United Nations to take decisive action on the question of Palestine  which remains a constant threat to international peace and security. The Member States of the United Nations have already expressed their collective desire in General Assembly resolution 38/58 C to convene an international conference on peace in the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations. Any peace initiative must be based on a comprehensive  just and lasting solution of the Middle East problem  which ensures the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem  and which enables the people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PUD)  to exercise its inalienable rights  including the right to return and the right to self-determination  national independence and the establishment of its independent sovereign State of Palestine.In this regard  the Arab Peace plan adopted unanimously at the 12th Arab summit conference  held in Fez in November 1981 and September 1982  and endorsed by the extraordinary summit conference of the Arab States held in Casablanca in August 1985  constitutes a landmark contribution towards the achievement of a comprehensive  just and lasting solution in the Middle East. The continued Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon  in defiance of Security Council resolution 509 (19B2)  is fostering sectarian strife so as to destabilize the country and impede the process of national unity and reconstruction in Lebanon. We request the United Nations to discharge its responsibility by bringing about the total withdrawal of Israel from Lebanese territory.The intense struggle of the South African black majority to rid itself of apartheid has widened into a critical situation that calls for the serious attention of the international community.The apartheid regime of South Africa has condemned the black South African majority to the most heinous conditions of racial segregation  racism and racial discrimination and confined it to degrading ""native reserves""  the so-called Bantustans  which have become the most common pool for cheap labor to serve the repressive policy of exploitation in the interests of the apartheid regime and its foreign allies.Moreover  the South African regime has created a hostile climate that has led to political and economic destabilization in the southern region and made the neighboring sovereign front-line States vulnerable to South African attacks and acts of unprovoked aggression against their territorial integrity to prevent them from extending moral and material support to the liberation struggle of the South African and Namibian peoples.It is immoral and inhuman to allow the South African question to stagnate while the atrocities perpetrated by South Africa continue to cause the disintegration and destruction of the very fabric of the black South African society  in flagrant violation of international legality and human tolerance  merely because the South African regime has shown its lack of interest in negotiating with the interested and concerned parties.We believe that the racist regime of south Africa will neither abandon its apartheid practices against the black African majority nor coexist peacefully with the neighboring sovereign States unless it is made to buckle under the impact of concerted and genuine international pressure imposed by all developed and developing nations without any exception.We urge the peace-loving international community to consider seriously all aspects of socio-economic and military sanctions  including full and effective implementation of the arms embargo against South Africa and especially preventing it from acquiring nuclear-weapon capabilities. We also urge the international community to put pressure to bear on South Africa for the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners.The South African black majority deservedly needs all the moral and material support the international community can generously extend to it for the success of its rightful cause. Likewise the front-line States should be supported in their efforts to defend themselves against the attacks and acts of aggression perpetrated by the armed forces of South Africa.All international efforts that could weaken the repressive machinery of the apartheid regime must be welcomed by all peace-loving nations of the international community. In this respect  we support the commendable proposals made at the second Paris Conference on sanctions against South Africa to intensify the efforts to abolish apartheid by imposing comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa.The world has become impatient with South Africa's refusal to terminate its illegal occupation of Namibia since its Mandate over the Territory was revoked and terminated by the adoption of United Nations General Assembly resolution 2145 (XXI)  of October 1966  after which the Territory was placed under the direct responsibility of the United Nations. Subserviently the Security Council  in its resolution 264 (1969)  of March 1969  declared South Africa's occupation of Namibia illegal and called upon that regime to withdraw immediately its administration from the Territory of Namibia.Defiant to all international appeals and refusing to terminate its illegal occupation of the Namibian territory  the Pretorial regime intensified its apartheid practices with increasing military and police repression to subjugate the Namibian people so that the apartheid regime would meet less opposition to its robbing and squandering of the vast natural and mineral wealth of the Territory.The encroachment of the apartheid forces has not been limited to Namibian and South African territories but has gone beyond their borders. The South African regime  using the Namibian territory as a launching pad  has repeatedly intimidated and waged war against the neighboring front-line States so as to destabilize and disrupt them and prevent them from extending support to the courageous people of Namibia. It is high time that the international community denounced these acts of aggression by South Africa and extended adequate moral  material and financial support to the front-line States to enable them to defend themselves against the repeated attacks of the apartheid regime of South Africa.The Namibian people  who have always fought colonization with great sacrifices  will continue to resist the exploitation of their land and the rapid depletion of their natural and mineral resources Ly South Africa and other foreign economic interests  in contravention of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and Decree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia.He are very confident that the courageous people of Namibia  under the wise leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) - their sole  authentic representative - will continue stepping up their rightful struggle for self-determination and the achievement of full independence. We commend SWAPO's patience and readiness to sign a cease-fire agreement with the South African regime within the context of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) without pre-conditions or further delay. We believe that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is the only genuine basis for solutions that can lead to the peaceful independence of Namibia. In this connection  we support the Declaration of the International Conference for the Immediate Independence of Namibia  adopted in Vienna  Austria  in July 1986  and the program of Action following thereafter  to mobilize and strengthen further international support for the immediate and unconditional implementation of united Nations Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Any other plan or strategy that deviates from that of the United Nations will only increase the intransigence of South Africa and will encourage it to delay the freedom and independence of the Namibian Territory.The international community must exert every effort possible to give to the Namibian people the moral  financial and material assistance needed to counter the South African aggression and to enable them to carry out their struggle under the wise leadership of SHAPO - their sole  authentic representative - to gain genuine freedom and independence.It is indeed disheartening to find ourselves once again addressing the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq that has ravaged the Gulf region for six years on end. Notwithstanding the steadfast efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement  the conflict still rages with unabated intensity  wreaking destruction upon economic infrastructures that are indispensable to both countries for their economic and social progress. It is also taking a heavy toll among civilian populations  especially in the present phase of escalation.I should like to commend the constructive efforts undertaken by the member States of the Economic Co-operation Council of the Gulf countries in their endeavorF to put an end to this bloody and destructive conflict  which not only is depleting the human and natural resources of the countries involved but also is threatening international peace and security. In the present circumstancesthe only reasonable course of action left to the parties concerned is to start dialog without any further delay to achieve a peaceful solution of their differences. In this regard  we appreciate and support the wise and constructive initiative taken by the Government of Iraq to terminate this senseless carnage and destruction and its intention to enter into peaceful negotiations leading to the settlement of the crisis.It is our hope that the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference will persevere in their endeavors to put an end to the conflict and restore peace in the region.The Chadian question has remained unresolved for many years  and the restoration of peace in -the country during that period of tine has evaded all possible solutions  while the sad fratricidal war has continued to ravage the country's human and material resources. He regret that the commendable mediation efforts exerted by several African Heads of State in the search for reconciliation and peace have been frustrated. He urge the competent bodies of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to continue their commendable efforts to explore all possible channels to speed up the process of peaceful negotiations to achieve national reconciliation and lead to a lasting political solution for the unification of Chad.With regard to the conflict in Western Sahara  we reaffirm our position in support of the Sahraoui people in the exercise of their right to self-determination. In that regard we reiterate our support for the consensus reached within the OAU to hold a referendum to allow the people of Western Sahara to exercise their right to self-determination in conformity with the spirit and resolutions of the OAU.For several years Afghanistan  a peaceful  developing and non-aligned country  has been a victim of foreign intervention  in violation of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and of the obligation of all States to refrain  in their international relations  from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of any State. Notwithstanding the persistent call of the inter*  -tonal community for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the soil of Afghanistan  the Afghan people continue to suffer from the brutality of foreign occupation.It is therefore incumbent upon the international community to endeavor to put an end to the continued and serious suffering of the Afghan people and to alleviate the socio-economic burden of neighboring countries where millions have sought refuge. We express our appreciation and support for the Secretary-General's sustained efforts and constructive steps in his search for a peaceful solution to the Afghan problem. The situation calls for the urgent achievement of a political solution that will enable the Afghan people to exercise their full right to sovereignty by choosing the social  political and economic systems of their preference  in accordance with their national aspirations.It is now eight years since the Kampuchean people fell victim to foreign military intervention. The persistent call of the overwhelming majority of the international community for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea has so far gone unheeded. He reiterate once again that the only way to put an end to the plight of the Kampuchea^ people is to ensure the evacuation of foreign forces from the country a- the restoration and preservation of the country's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and to allow the Kampuchean people to choose freely the system of government they may wish to establish.The situation that has prevailed on the Korean peninsula since the early 1950s is fraught with tension. He believe that the best way to foster better relations between North and South .Korea is to create the necessary conditions that would enable the Koreans themselves to undertake a constructive dialog to resolve their differences. A lasting .settlement can be achieved only if the Koreans themselves can establish mutual trust without any interference from outside.The international community could not have chosen a better forum than this body to exchange views on matters so vital to its survival. As the Assembly united us now  our thoughts cannot escape from the shadows of the gloomy pictures of the world environment  plagued with countless civil strifes  confrontations  conflicts and mass displacements of population as a result of the deteriorating third world economic situation  aggravated by the runaway global economy  by unrelenting natural disasters and by prevalent uncertainties in international economic relations.The ceaseless cry for help of the hundreds of millions of people suffering in squalid misery  starvation and abject poverty and of the tens of millions of homeless refugees and displaced persons  as well as the unbearable human suffering all over the world  add darker clouds to these gloomy pictures that have always crowded the panorama of our daily thoughts. Despite all that  our strong faith in human solidarity in tines of crisis has taught us to trust that the spirit of true co-operation and understanding among the nations of the world will prevail over the consequent fears aid suspicion emanating from such unremitting hardships.We are confident that our need to live together in a peaceful and secure environment will transcend the reluctant and stunning state Bate in global dialog and lead to better survival. Our wisdom and deep foresight in safeguarding our inter<* pendent relationship will pragmatically guide our endeavors in all matters that influence the wellbeing of our world  in accordance with the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter."
"41",1950,"DNK",41,1986,"Mr. President  allow me  first  to offer to you my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. I can assure you of the full co-operation of the Danish delegation in the performance of the duties of your high office.Denmark's strong and persistent support  in deed as well as in words  of the United Nations is well known. Over the years Denmark has been a major contributor to United Nations efforts in the economic  social and technical fields as well as to United Nations peace-keeping forces. Our contributions have steadily increasedalso in relative terms. This increase reflects our strong belief that in a rapidly■i(Slanging world of growing interdependence  multilateral co-operation remains indispensable.The focus of attention of the General Assembly is on what is widely seen as an acute financial crisis of the United Nations. We commend the Secretary-General for having taken the measures approved by the General Assembly in April. They have served to alleviate the situation in the short run. It will be a main task of this session of the General Assembly to address the question of appropriate medium and long-term measures. The viability of the Organization itself is at stake.It is essential that all Member States fulfill their part of the responsibility for financing the United Nations. Unilateral action by HeiabeE States in contravention of the Charter undermines the authority and work of the Organization.*We welcome the report of the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations. It contains a number of valuable recommendations which  it is to be hoped  will initiate a process of reform.As I see it  we must pursue two objectives simultaneously first  we must make a determined effort towards administrative and financial reform; second  and probably more important  we must seek a more realistic common understanding of what can be expected from the United Nations.As in previous years a number of important international issues are before the General Assembly. Turning first to developments in the East-West relationship  I am encouraged to note that there has been some improvement. The United States and the Soviet Union are preparing for a new summit meeting.Denmark hopes that the negotiations will provide a better climate and renewed confidence and dialog between East and West.We should not assume that dialog can remove all differences between East and West. It cannot. But the dialog must address itself to the real problems and aim at concrete solutions. The extent to which we achieve such solutions will be the proper measure of the attainment of genuine detente.Thus  detente must not be limited to efforts towards relaxation of political and military tens ions. It must be comprehensive and comprise also a dialog on humanitarian issues of direct relevance to individuals in East and West alike as well as on economic co-operation  trade and environmental problems.It is of overriding importance that all countries in East and West should participate in this dialog. In difficult times for the East-West relationship  contacts between the smaller and medium-sized European countries of East and West have helped the dialog along. After the summit meeting in Geneva inNovember 1985  contacts contacts between the two great Powers have taken a newdimension. But all countries in Europe  allied or neutral or non-aligned  have something to contribute to the dialog between East and West.The process initiated by the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe forms a focal point for dialog and confidence-building among the participating Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSC2) States in Europe and North America.The recent successful conclusion of the Stockholm Conference with the adoption of new confidence and security-building measures has laid the foundation for improving confidence in the military field. Confidence-building is  however  a subject that cannot be limited to the military area. Compliance with the commitments which the participating States have undertaken in the Helsinki Final Act and the Madrid Concluding Document  not least within the human dimension  is equally important for creating confidence between East and West.The CSCE follow-up meeting due to open in Vienna this autumn will be a most important forum for efforts to intensify dialog and improve confidence between East and West.At the Vienna Meeting  there will be a particular need for progress towards the solution of humanitarian questions. Countries which are still lagging behind should be persuaded to improve their standards in  above all  family reunification.No State should deny a citizen the right to go abroad to be reunited with his relatives there. As a Polish philosopher has said*.""I can respect a no-entry sign  but I am disgusted when I see a no-exit sign.nIn the field of arms control and disarmament no effort must be spared to halt the current arms race. Only through concrete verifiable arms control agreements can a new and improved security be created at a lower level of armamentsThe current arms control negotiations in Geneva between the United states and the Soviet Union must lead to effective agreements aimed at preventing an arms race in space and terminating it cm earth  at limiting and reducing nuclear arms  and at strengthening strategic stability.The Danish Government attaches the utmost importance to the ongoing deliberations at the Conference on Disarmament  in particular  I wish to urge the Conference on Disarmament to speed up its endeavors to reach agreement on initiating negotiations for an early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty.Similarly  we believe that there is every reason for the Conference to step up its efforts to achieve early agreement cm a global and comprehensive ban on chemical weapons.The upsurge of terrorism represents an alarming aspect of the international situation posing a mortal threat to the very fabric of our societies as well as to orderly and friendly relations between nations. The world-wide nature of the problem requires concerted international action to stamp out this evil. The proper forum for dealing with international terrorism is the United Nations  and we were therefore gratified by the adoption last year of resolutions both by the General Assembly and the Security Council on these problems. The entire international community agreed to condemn as criminal all acts  methods and practices of terrorism  wherever and by whomever committed. We urge all Member States to intensify international co-operation to apprehend  prosecute and punish the perpetrators of such acts. There must be no safe haven for terrorists.Among the positive elements in the work of the United Nations  and a source of great inspiration and satisfaction  is the fact that over the years the Organization has been able to agree on an impressive body of internationally recognized human rights standards. These standards command the universal acceptance of the world community „ Unfortunately  we are witnessing daily violations of these standards.Various mechanisms have been set in motion to supervise the implementation of these standards and in our opinion it is vital for the credibility of the relevant human rights instruments that these median isms be used. It is the responsibility of Governments to respect and ensure the enjoyment of human rights for their citizens  and Governments which shrink from fulfilling this obligation should constantly be reminded of their duty through the appropriate organs of our Organization  including from this General Assembly rostrum.May I now turn to another serious subject which must be of concern to all of us - the world refugee situation. It is a gloomy picture we are faced with  and our public rightly expects this universal Organization  the United Nations  to live up to its responsibility as laid down in the Charter. In the United Nations Charter we have pledged ourselves to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to let the world Organization be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common goals. It follows from this solemn undertaking that when human rights violations force people to leave their country of origin and become refugees all other countries must take steps to alleviate the sufferings of those people and thereby secure respect for their human rights.My Government wishes  during this session of the General Assembly  to share with all representatives some concrete ideas that we have developed with a view to establishing a mechanism whereby the international community  basing itself on the principles of burden-sharing and solidarity  could take a major step forward in solving the world refugee problem. The key elements in that mechanism are: voluntary repatriation  regional integration  increased United Nations presence in different regions of the world  and allocation of quotas based on a United Nations scheme. We shall present our more detailed views when the relevant agenda item is discussed in the Third Committee.Racism and racial discrimination are flagrant violations of human rights. One Government in the world not only condones racial discrimination on its territory but has made racism the very essence of its social order. To maintain its abhorrent apartheid system the Government of South Africa pursues atrocious repression at home  brutal aggression and destabilization against neighboring States  and an illegal occupation of Namibia which openly defies decisions of the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly.It is in cunt) en t upon this Organization to reflect and act upon the deep concern and indignation of the entire international community at the persistence of such serious violations of fundamental human rights as are being committed by the apartheid regime. But apartheid and what goes with it are more than a violation of human rights. The provocation which that system presents to the neighboring countries  to other African nations and to the whole world is a threat to international peace and security - a threat that will persist until apartheid has been totally eliminated and replaced by a system based on democracy and equality for all South Africans.It is a basic feature of Danish policy that we believe in and strive for peaceful solutions to international conflicts. We believe that mandatory sanctions in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter should be imposed on South Africa. They are the most effective instrument available to the international community to promote peaceful change. As a member of the Security Council  Denmark has worked actively for the adoption of such measures and will continue to do so.In the absence of agreement in the Security Council on sanctions under Chapter VII  Denmark has decided to take measures  together with our Nordic and European Community partners and on our own  on a voluntary unilateral basis. In fact Denmark has gone further in this regard than any other Western country. Nearly all Danish contacts with South Africa  including trade  will come to a halt before the end of this year. Our diplomacy is engaged in a systematic effort to encourage other countries to increase their contribution to reinforced and more effective international pressure against apartheid.Outside pressure is not only intended to be a signal to the South African Government""  it serves as a sign of solidarity with the South African population and as encouragement and an indication that an alternative can be found to violence and destruction.Let President Botha's new rigid position on what he calls ""outside interference"" and his increasingly oppressive policies be a warning to the international community. Delay in making the message clear to those in South Africa who hold the key may soon place the situation beyond reach. We must act now.As for Namibia  the Danish Government remains convinced that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is the only internationally acceptable solution to the Namibian question. Delaying tactics on South Africa's part cannot be tolerated. Namibia's independence is long overdue and should be pursued by all peaceful means  including sanctions in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.The countries in southern Africa have for many years been important partners in Denmark's development co-operation program. The priority given to that region is a natural correlate to the restrictive measures which we have adopted against South Africa. Together with the other Nordic countries  we will work actively at . the United Nations to obtain agreement on a contingency plan for economic assistance to South Africa's neighbors in the event of South African reprisals against those countries.In fact  approximately one third of our bilateral development assistance is provided to the countries of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). At the SADCC meeting in Harare in January  Denmark pledged a 100 per cent increase to 400 million Danish kroner in its assistance to regional SADCC co-operation. Together with the other Nordic countries and the SADCC member States  a Joint Declaration on Expanded Economic Co-operation was signed on the same occasion.The Joint Declaration between the SADCC and Nordic countries reflects the it tual determination of the two regions to intensify co-operation and constitutes the framework for new avenues of collaboration extending beyond the traditional donor-recipient relationship.The economic difficulties facing the African continent remain staggering  and profound changes in domestic policies are required to turn the situation around. Against this background  the special session of the General Assembly on Africa took place at a crucial point in time. The courageous approach of the African countries reflected their readiness to seek new avenues and make a firm commitment to policy reform. Denmark regards the adoption of the program of action by consensus as a very positive outcome of the Conference  both for the United Nations as an organization and for the Member States. But now let us not lose momentum. The real achievement is not the adoption of the program but its implementation. Donors and recipients must both shoulder their responsibility.In the Middle Bast three major conflicts remain of serious concern to the world community  and not least to the countries of Europe  which have close and vital links with the area. Guided by the general principles set out by the countries of the European Community in their Venice Declaration  we have in the past year continued to support initiatives aimed at bringing the parties to the Arab-Israeli dispute together in talks for peace."" .ere encouraged by the efforts made by King Hussein of Jordan to open the path to a constructive engagement of authentic Palestinian representatives in the peace process  and we were correspondingly discouraged when the King concluded that he had not been able to secure the necessary commitment from the Palestine Liberation Organization.If the peace process is to move forward  it will be necessary for those who are most directly involved and who have the welfare of the Palestinian people at heart to put their political differences aside and unite in support of a realistic and constructive engagement aimed at a negotiated peace. In this context I should like to pay a tribute to those courageous leaders in the Middle East who are showing the way by realistic and constructive initiatives to widen the dialog.In Lebanon sectarian strife continues to exact a terrible price in human life and suffering. We can only appeal once again for moderation and reason and a will to compromise  without which it appears the very existence of Lebanon is threatened. When the Lebanese themselves choose to build on their common humanity and engage in true national reconciliation they shall find our ready support for the full restoration of Lebanese unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity.The continuation of the conflict between Iran and Iraq  which is now in its seventh year  presents us with a picture of untold human carnage and suffering. Both parties  as well as the world community and the standards of civilization  stand only to lose by further continuation of this appalling war. From this rostrum I appeal to both parties to respect Security Council resolution 582 (1986) and use the United Nations and the good offices of the Secretary-General to work out a compromise on this conflict  which need never have escalated into war and which by its nature is negotiable.In Afghanistan another war is taking place. There Soviet forces continue with undiminished determination their brutal attempts to suppress popular resistance within the country  with horrifying consequences for the civilian population.The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan must be brought to an end. Might does not make right  no matter how strong the Power. The Danish Government hopes that the talks held under the auspices of the United Nations  which have made important progress  will lead to an early agreement acceptable to all parties concerned and provide for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops.The situation in Kampuchea also remains an issue of grave concern to the international community. It is Denmark's long-standing position that a solution to the Kampuchean problem must be found on the basis of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations. In this spirit Denmark supports the endeavors of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) with regard to Kampuchea. We see merit in theeight-point proposal of the coalition Government  which in our view represents a positive contribution to the search for a just and durable negotiated settlement of the conflict.As to the complex problems of Central America  the Danish Government fully understands and supports the aspirations of the peoples of Central America to a life in peace and dignity  a life in countries committed to democratic systems of government  free elections  freedom of the press and respect for human rights and a life in communities that strive for a more just and equitable distribution of much too scarce resources.In our view the discrepancy that exists in most Central American countries between those aspirations and the hard realities is at the root of the present conflicts. Only the countries of Central America themselves can  within their respective borders  eliminate the fundamental causes of the current strife.What the outside world can and must do is to offer its co-operation  economic and political  to the countries of the region and encourage and support initiatives designed to fulfill those aspirations.The Danish Government continues to believe that there is no realistic and acceptable alternative to the Contadora peace process. At the core of that process lies the belief that the Central American countries themselves are responsible for solving their differences and that a lasting solution must be achieved^ by peaceful means without any kind of military pressure or other forms of coercion.The global economic situation has improved in important respects over the last few years. In general  growth has resumed  inflation been brought down and interest rates reduced. Exchange-rate patterns have been brought more in line with fundamental economic conditions. However  difficult problems and uncertainties remain and pose a threat to global economic development and stability. Let me mention some of the problems that can be addressed only through international co-operation for the benefit of industrialized and developing countries alike.Since ancient times international trade has been the most powerful transmitter of growth  development and civilization that we can conceive of. But international trade is crucially dependent on the maintenance and further strengthening of the free-trade system. I should therefore like to congratulate our colleagues in Punta del Este on their success in launching a new round of trade negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs arid Trade (GATT). The result is immensely important for international economic co-operation  but also for the political climate as a whole.Most developing countries continue to face serious debt problems  which in many cases are aggravated by persistently low prices for their exports of commodities. True  though varying in size and composition between different countries  the debt burden remains a serious obstacle to growth and development. Measures to relieve this burden are therefore indispensable. But at the same time it must be ensured that debt relief measures are adapted to the circumstances of individual debtor countries and utilized in a context of economic policy reform and structural adjustment. In this spirit Denmark has responded positively to a large number of requests for the cancellation of official development assistance (ODA) debt from least-developed countries.Denmark's commitment to the developing world is reflected in our official development assistance. This year sees an extraordinary rise in Danish development assistance  which has long surpassed the international 0.7 per cent target. Denmark will increase its aid volume further in each of the coming years  reaching the 1 per cent target in 1992.The multilateral development system is an important element of United Nations activities. The call for improved efficiency in the work of the United Nations applies also to activities financed by voluntary contributions. Important progress has already been achieved  not least within the United Nations Development program. Denmark expects all development organs and organizations to intensify their efforts to ensure the necessary flexibility  efficiency  co-operation and co-ordination in their work.If such efforts are to succeed  the international donor community must respond by maintaining and increasing voluntary contributions. Denmark is prepared to fulfill its responsibility in this regard. We expect all donor countries to live up to their responsibility and to make voluntary contributions to the multilateral development system commensurate with their ability to contribute. We have watched with growing concern the tendency in industrialized countries to solve problems in domestic economies at the expense of development aid.The world of today is a world with bitter conflicts rooted in opposing ideologies  competing interests and rivaling claims to influence and power. Naturally  all Member countries seek to use the United Nations for the advancement of their aims  to strengthen their ideology  their interests and their claims. So the activity of the Organization is characterized by struggle and confrontation  because it faithfully reflects the world we live in  and because the substance of its work is considered by its Members to be of fundamental importance.But even bitter debates come to an end  and mostly the end reflects recognition of the overriding need for co-operation to solve our common problems to which there can only be common solutions.The present crisis of the United Nations can be overcome if %-is strengthen the tendencies of co-operation and restrain the tendencies of confrontation. The crisis is also an opportunity.We must do our utmost to preserve and fully utilize the potential for action inherent in this much needed Organization. We must see to it that it not only survives  but constantly develops as a universal forum for heir iconizing the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends and purposes. Such  in brief  is the challenge to the wisdom and imagination of this session of the General Assembly."
"42",1995,"DOM",41,1986," At this traditional gathering all the peoples of the world converge to reflect once again on the ideals of collective peace and security and to renew our commitment to the principles and values governing the international unification which is enshrined in this Organization. It is therefore a great honor for me in these circumstances to address the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-first session. It is also a great pleasure to convey to you  Mr. President  and to the heads of delegation the greetings of the Dominican people and its newly constituted Government  freely elected by popular suffrage.This is an excellent opportunity to offer you  Sir  my congratulations on your unanimous election to the prestigious office of President of the current session of the General Assembly. My congratulations are also extended to the other members of the Bureau  with heartfelt wishes that the work entrusted to them will result in an understanding and solution of the many problems afflicting the international community and covering social  economic and political aspects. You may rely on the full support and co-operation of the delegation of the Dominican Republic. You  Sir  your country and your regional group deserve the signal honor of occupying the presidency of the General Assembly. Your outstanding personal and professional skills  as well as your extensive knowledge of the problems and issues affecting international life  and particularly those related to the interests of the developing countries  are a sound guarantee that you will conduct our business with wisdom and objectivity.We are deeply grateful to your predecessor  the distinguished diplomat Don Jaime de Pinies  a son of Spain - a country to which we owe many of the fundamental features of our culture and to which we are linked by unbreakable bends of friendship. He provided exemplary leadership during the debates of the very important Assembly session commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.My sincere and warm congratulations are extended to the Secretary-General  who has throughout the duration of his mandate displayed abnegation  zeal and complete dedication to the cause championed by the nations assembled in this world Organization. Please accept  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our compliments and admiration for your praiseworthy and constructive work to promote the development of the Organization and the leading role which it is playing in the constant search for appropriate solutions to the problems affecting today's world.The delegation of the Dominican Republic also wishes to express gratitude to the Presidents and Secretaries-General of the United Nations who are no longer with us. The mere fact that so many peoples are associated with cordial solidarity in the ideal of peace which should govern the international order is in itself tangible proof of the work accomplished by them in promoting the values and principles enshrined in its Charter.For the Dominican Republic  the Charter of the United Nations oontinues to be the valid structure for the attainment of the goals of peace  social development and world security pursued by this international body. We are aware that the observance of international law  of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the norms and practices derived from the multilateral approach to problems will improve relations between States and permit solutions to the major issues affecting mankind.This is an appropriate time for the Dominican Republic to express special pride to be the host country of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of women  better known as IN5TOAW. This international body is devoted to the improvement of women in all spheres - politics  economics  society and the family - in keeping with the cultural characteristics of each society.These objectives reflect concerns and approaches of the Dominican Government. In 1975  during International Women's Year  it gave a decisive impetus to this item which concerns half  and perhaps slightly over half  of the world's inhabitants. The presence and operation of IUSURAW on our soil will undoubtedly provide an even greater incentive for Dominican women to participate in national development. We are most willing to extend any co-operation that may be necessary in the valuable task performed by the United Nations Institute.We also wish to announce that  at the request of our Government  the United Nations has established a trust fund for the promotion of a United Nations Program on aging. The creation of such a Program to deal with the economic  social and cultural problems resulting from the aging of the world population has been a concern of our country since 1981.The holding of the World Assembly on Aging and the formulation of an International Plan of Action on Aging place upon us all as States Members of the United Nations an obligation vis-a-vis future generations to put into practice the concepts set out in such a plan of action.By a happy coincidence  my first statement to the United Nations General Assembly as Secretary of State for External Relations of the new Government of the Dominican Republic is being given in the context of the celebration of the International Year of Peace. This coincidence could not be more fortunate. The preservation of peace is the fundamental aspiration of the new Dominican Government  both at home and on the international scene. Without peace there can be no economic progress or social development. Without peace there can be no harmonious and civilized relations between peoples and nations. Without peace it is impossible to achieve true international solidarity to tackle our shared problems.For over 25 years now a genuine democratic process has been taking place in the Dominican Republic  with difficulties and set-backs but with firm determination. Barely four months ago  at honest and exemplary elections  the Dominican people  exercising its sacred right of suffrage  elected Dr.Joaauln Balaguer to the highest office in the country.There is no doubt that the latest Dominican elections constitute a clear manifestation of constitutional reaffirmation and democratic continuity. It was President Balaguer himself who bravely and patriotically paved the way for this process. Not to state this here would be to commit an injustice by overlooking a historical truth.Prom this very same rostrum  on 2 October 1961  Dr. Joaauin Balaguer  who was then and is today again President of the Dominican Republic  denounced the atrocities of the Trujillo dictatorship and promised to open the doors of the nation to fundamental freedoms. It fell to him to lay the foundations of our democracy  of which the observance  respect and promotion of human rights is an essential element. I should like to take this opportunity to outline some of the basic objectives and goals the newly installed Dominican Government has set itself at the national level. First  I should like to refer to the clear interest taken by our President in enhancing the necessary conditions for the establishment of a genuine climate of national conciliation and harmony. This conciliation stage  a prerequisite for our current democratic life  is the correct framework for promoting the Government's projects and plans for solving the problems oppressing our country.In his speech upon taking the oath as President of the Dominican Republic on 16 August 1986  Joaguin Balaguer enumerated the basic concepts that will guide the new Administration. Our Government is based on participatory democracy  which fosters an evolution based on the responsibility and interaction of all sectors of our society in the affairs of State. Its objectives are concord and constitutional democratic continuity through sustained economic development. This is therefore a democracy in a republican mold  pluralist and rooted in social justice and in the values of the common welfare prevailing in a free society. It is a political system that recognizes freedom of enterprise as a right.Mr. Balaguer has set as his first goal the restoration of the country's confidence in the honesty of public servants and in the rectitude of the highest authorities of the nation - confidence  security  stability and development  all within the framework of the ethical principles of Christian democracy and of the categorical imperative of the national interest.Defining with crystal clarity what would be his attitude towards the people  the Dominican President stated:""I intend to govern exclusively for the country; I am not going to be the vassal of economic or ideological interests of any kind. Whenever I have to take any decision  I shall openly discuss the problem at issue with the sectors concerned  but my final decision will be the one that conforms to theinterest of the country and not to that of a particular group. OurGovernment  to sum up  will not be a Government of accommodations or aweather-vane veering in the direction in which it is blown by the winds ofdemagogy.""The political design of the Dominican Government encompasses a strong desire to govern mainly with the younger generations  but without ignoring the experience acquired by mature men who are exemplary citizens.The aspects of social life the new Dominican Government intends to promote include the upkeep of public works  encouragement of domestic savings and protection of the Dominican forests.I now wish to refer to the foreign policy of the new Dominican Government. As I said in the first part of my statement  peace is our fundamental goal in the international sphere. The objective of peace will thus be the foundation setting the philosophical tone of all our activity on the international scene. This ideological concept will therefore be very much present in all the principles that shape our foreign policy  which can be summed up as follows: national independence and the interest of the nation; solidarity and friendship with all peace-loving  freedom-loving peoples; the juridical equality of all States; faith in the fundamental rights of the human person; faithful fulfillment of legally contracted international obligations; peaceful settlement of international conflicts and disputes; non-intervention in the affairs of other States; the self-determination of peoples; renunciation of the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State; development and strengthening of good-neighborliness; international co-operation and  lastly  the establishment of a true international social justice.In line with our policy of peace  which is simply the reflection of the pacifist vocation of the Dominican people  I wish to refer to a situation that is a matter of deep concern to our Government. I refer to the situation in Central America. It is clear that the problems experienced by our brothers in Central America are due principally to the unfair economic  social and political structures that have prevailed for some time now in that part of our America. There lie the roots of the current Central America crisis. For this reason  it is imperative to establish in the region a more open and participatory social order  with fairer and more equitable relations between all the members of the social conglomerate  a social order in which the masses have access to the minimum benefits of civilization and culture  free from continental or extra-continental interference.The case of El Salvador is one of the most important in that region. The President of that country has again offered all those involved in the armed guerrilla activities the opportunity to participate directly in the new political order of that nation. That offer was made on the basis of principles underlying the peaceful coexistence of a democratic  pluralist and representative society  so that  together  they may build a new El Salvador. This is an example of determination to solve the problems involved in the Central American conflicts.We acknowledge that if the Central America crisis has not spread into a serious  generalized conflagration it is basically because of the tenacious work done by the Contadora Group. That Group — the most authentic expression of the Latin American pacifist vocation - has created a propitious climate enabling the Central American States  which are the only ones competent to resolve their differences  to find ways to overcome their regional problems through dialog  negotiation and mutual understanding. The Group has formulated a legal instrument that provides a broad basis for unraveling the political aspects of the crisis and offers substantive solutions to the unfair socio-economic structures causing the problems.In this spirit we urge the Central American countries to continue the negotiations on pending matters in accordance with the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America. At the same time  we would encourage States with ties and interests in that region to display political will and offer their strongest backing to the activities being undertaken by the Contadora Group  which reflect the thinking of the entire region.Another situation that is a constant source of concern to the international community  and particularly to the Latin American region  is the one still existing in the South Atlantic  it is an incontestable fact that  until the situation of the Malvinas Islands is resolved fairly and peacefully  a latent element of disturbance will remain that could affect international peace and security. In this connection we make an urgent appeal to the Governments of Argentina and of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to resume negotiations with a view to finding  as soon as possible  a peaceful solution to the sovereignty dispute and to the other Questions linked to that problem.The reasoning of the Dominican Republic is that there is no international dispute or conflict that cannot be resolved through the means of peaceful settlement provided by international law and by the Charter of the United Nations.Continuing the examination of some of the main trouble spots that could jeopardize the maintenance of international peace and security  I wish to refer to the situation still existing in Korea and to the relations between the two communities inhabiting that peninsula. On this occasion  our delegation echoes the wish - already expressed previously by the General Assembly - that ways be found of solving the Korean problem. We hope that in accordance with the principles of the Charter and through the machinery provided by the United Nations  those two countries will succeed in establishing peaceful relations  reducing the tension in that part of the world. This would represent a step towards the restoration of peace in an important part of our world  as well as an effort by our international organization to promote dialog and mutual co-operation between the two communities.A constant element of international conduct is defense of the principle of self-determination of peoples and of the right of peoples freely to decide which form of government they consider best suited to their national interests.Unswerving attachment to those principles compels us to voice before this gathering of the international community our profound concern at the situation existing in various parts of the world  where foreign interference is undermining the sacred rights of national sovereignty and independence.For all those reasons  we share the grave concern of the international community at the continuing foreign armed intervention in Afghanistan. Consequently we supported the resolutions on the subject adopted by the United Nations  which advocate a political solution to this situation based on thewithdrawal of foreign troops and full respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan.We express similar concern at the continuing conflicts and tension in Kampuchea. We believe that only a negotiating process aimed at finding a comprehensive political solution through peaceful means would be able to reduce that tension and to establish the necessary conditions to enable the people of Kampuchea to exercise its right to self-determination.In this part of my statement  devoted to consideration of the principal conflicts and situations that constitute a real source of concern in the context of efforts to achieve peace  I must necessarily refer to the situation in the Middle East. There is no topic of greater concern to international public opinion than the Middle East. It is the desire of the delegation and people of the Dominican Republic to approach with complete impartiality and fairness the complex situation in the Middle East  because of the effects of such confrontations on the international political balance and hence on world peace.The Dominican Republic is firmly of the opinion that any peace solution in the Middle East should adhere very closely to Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which notes the existence of the State of Israel and its right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. But it is also undeniable that the problem of the Palestinians is a crucial one  which must be solved. We therefore support all initiatives and efforts conducive to peace and stability in that region.The situation in Lebanon  a country cruelly torn by fratricidal struggles  is extremely alarming  it is the moral obligation of the international community to help the parties involved to negotiate a just and lasting peace and to extend its full co-operation in the restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty.The bloody war in the Persian Gulf between Iran and Iraq  with enormous ensuing problems for the belligerent parties as well as for neighboring countries may lead to an expansion of the area of conflict and to an increase in destruction. This war is an example of the irrationality which sometimes prevails in international relations.The occupation of the territory of Cyprus and the risk of its partition are also alarming. Such situations undermine the confidence placed in the principles and norms governing the international order and therefore must not be tolerated.All forms of discrimination on grounds of race  sex  language or religion are odious to the conscience of mankind. An act of discrimination against someone because of the color of his skin is a morally reprehensible  socially unjust and truly unworthy act. It is therefore regrettable that political systems are still being established with racial distinctions at their base.Apartheid is therefore a crime against humanity and a threat to international peace and security. We condemn the policy pursued by the South African regime and identify ourselves with the efforts of the United Nations to help to establish a democratic society in that country. Such a society should guarantee respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all  irrespective of race  color  sex or religion.It is obvious that any form of colonialism or foreign domination contains the seeds of a threat to current international relations. For this reason  we express our deep concern at the continuing illegal occupation of Namibia by the South African regime  in flagrant violation of the resolutions of the United Nations. The Dominican Republic has been and still is a stubborn champion of the independence of subjugated communities and considers that this process of emancipation must not be interrupted. We therefore support all the efforts undertaken by the United Nations and by other countries to achieve the independence and autonomy of Namibia. We also advocate the retention by Namibia of its entire cultural patrimony and of all the resources in its possession. Our country andits new Government reiterate their firm opinion that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the only basis for the peaceful settlement of the situation in Namibia.The Government of the Dominican Republic views with great alarm the upsurge of international terrorism  which may become a danger to the right of preservation of States and an imminent risk for the maintenance of peace. This practice has become so extensive and frequent that it currently constitutes one of the most pernicious forms of violation of human rights. It is also one of the practices with the greatest divisive power  creating international tensions that may provoke serious conflicts.Another dangerous practice I wish to mention is the narcotics trade - a scourge that has the most merciless effects on mankind. The Dominican Republic sympathizes with any activity designed to combat the underlying causes of this social evil and to establish effective machinery to fight drug trafficking. The Dominican Republic urges the United Nations to appoint a commission to study the problem of the narcotics trade and its prejudicial effects on the life of our peoples  so that we may find a solution to that serious evil.The flight of capital and administrative corruption are two more evils afflicting human society. The Government of the Dominican Republic is appalled and highly alarmed at those practices  which are becoming endemic. We believe that the problems caused by the flight of capital and administrative corruption should be included on the agenda of the next United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. That would ensure that the necessary measures are taken to guarantee a concerted and sustained co-operative effort to deal internationally with such crimes as administrative corruption  tax evasion and flight of capital. We therefore make a formal request for international solidarity in the condemnation of any form of national and international administrative corruption. Many problems faced by our countries would be surmounted or minimized if the huge amount of capital deposited in foreign banks were to be reinvested in the countries of origin.The global economic situation too demands our attention. We have for several years been immersed in an economic crisis  the worst since the 1930s. As was to be expected  it is those who are least prepared to face it that the crisis has hit hardest. We refer to those who are suffering the most adverse consequences: the developing countries. The deterioration of their economies necessitates a new approach to economic problems  one guaranteeing that the correlation between peace and development is maintained.In the past few months there have been promising changes in global macro-economic variables. Among the changes beneficial to the economies of our countries ares United States monetary expansion and its effects on international liquidity  the decline in the value of the dollar and in interest rates on United States and international capital markets  and the notable drop in the price of oil and oil products. Nevertheless  there are persistent unfavorable factors in the global panorama  including the protectionism implicit in the decline of the united States dollar  the reluctance of the principal industrialized countries to assume an aggressive leadership role in the upswing of international free trade  and the refusal of the banks to bear the consequences of the risk they took when they lent what they are now trying to collect from us.In view of the distressing state of affairs provoked by the economic crisis it may be stated confidently that the large burden of social tensions resting upon almost two thirds of the world's population as a result of this crisis constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. It could be said without exaggeration that nearly all the Latin American and Caribbean countries have been seriously affected by the current economic and financial crisis. Among all the economic problems facing our nations  external indebtedness is becoming the most burdensome. According to reliable figures  Latin America will have to devote the equivalent of one third of its total export earnings to interest payments alone.In the case of the Dominican Republic  certain aggravating circumstances exist in relation to its overwhelming external debt. In recent years our country has undergone a highly painful process of adjustment. That was asked of us  and we complied. Today we are an example of a successful case for the International Monetary Fund. But what have we obtained in exchange? The obligation to renegotiate our external debt every one or two years? The obligation to continue to bear the unfortunate consequences of the Common Market's subsidies to its sugar producers?If our creditors are pressing us to pay them on time they must help us demolish the protectionist tariff barriers set up by the industrial world. Otherwise  the creditor banks will suffer with us the negative consequences of protectionism  ultimately this will aggravate the situation  postponing once again the solution of the debt crisis  with its incalculable social repercussions.In addition to the terrible situation created by the need for debt repayment  which is difficult in itself  we are also facing excessive growth in unemployment  a decline in real wages  constant inflationary pressure and a consequent deterioration in the quality of life.In speaking of the world economic crisis and the need for international co-operation to avert or alleviate this state of affairs  I have been unable to put out of my mind the fine example of solidarity that was given here in the UnitedNations when the situation in Africa was being studied. The extraordinary feeling of solidarity present in our peoples was apparent on that occasion. Imbued with that profound sense of solidarity and because Haiti and the Dominican Republic are the only two free countries to share an island  I should like on behalf of the Government and the people of the Dominican Republic to exhort the international community in .general and the Latin American region in particular to launch a crusade of international assistance to the sister Republic of Haiti.After long years submerged in a dark labyrinth of oppression  suffering and poverty  the Haitian people is currently struggling to establish a real State based on the rule of law  and a climate of freedom in which equality  law  justice and respect for human rights reign  we must therefore help our brethren in Haiti in their brave effort to create a democratic society.I cannot let this opportunity pass without referring to one of the most serious of universal concerns  which in my opinion involves the possibility of the extinction of mankind: nuclear war. It is not my intention to paint a sombre and fatalistic picture as I deal with this topic  but I want my words to carry a power of persuasion sufficient to underline and emphasize the real danger to the human race represented by the outbreak of a nuclear conflagration. The power of nuclear weapons to wreak mass destruction and annihilation is so catastrophic that the foreseeable result of a nuclear war would unquestionably be universal disaster. That horrifying prospect should touch our most sensitive cords and move us to reflect on the urgency and advisability of negotiations on the control of nuclear weapons.In view of those considerations  the Dominican Republic has supported the convening of an international conference on the relationship between disarmament and development. We trust that at its forty-first session the General Assembly will be able to set a definite time and place for the holding of that conference in 1987.According to the numerous reports of the Secretary-General  the financial situation of the United Nations is truly critical. We very much appreciate the interest shown by the Secretary-General in overcoming this difficult situation. Accordingly  we support the package of measures he has formulated to alleviate the current crisis. We are confident that the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts established to deal with the problem will be able to evolve suitable measures to resolve it. The Dominican Government will do everything in its power to help to negotiate these difficult economic straits.In conclusion  I should like to leave with the Assembly the points I have mentioned which I believe should be the subject of particular thought.Acts of terrorism  which formerly served to express repugnance towards tyrannical Governments  are now daily occurrences in countries with democratic regimes  where public freedoms are fully exercised. Terrorism has penetrated free and democratic societies with its divisive and criminal action. It is imperative that international bodies start a concerted search for immediate solutions to the problem.The trade in narcotic drugs is causing the physical and moral destruction of our young people  and the day is not far off when the capital acquired through drug-trafficking will be used to finance political operations that are contrary to the democratic essence that we hope will predominate in our world.The problem of the external debt of the poor part of America must be tackled bravely and wisely. It is essential to set long repayment periods and low interest rates for the debt as a whole  but then it is necessary for us creatively to invent financial compensation formulas that do not condemn our peoples to poverty  oppression or the indefinite postponement of their economic development. It is possible  within legal limits and in accordance with the national interest  for shares in firms of debtor countries to be sold to creditor countries. Thus  where there are foreign exchange shortages debtors and creditors could become partners. Similarly  there should be a study of the possibility of granting to creditors for periods contractually agreed on  without prejudice to national sovereignty  the use of geographical areas suitable for tourism to generate income that could be applied to the payment of the external debt.On behalf of the Dominican Government and people  I thank you  Sir  and the Assembly for this opportunity to speak here to explain my country's thinking about what is happening in the world and is affecting us all. The Dominican Republic will spare no effort to retain its place in the concert of free nations fighting for the preservation of peace  respect for human rights and the creation of development opportunities for their peoples  all within a democratic regime which upholds the principle of free enterprise."
"43",2042,"DZA",41,1986,"Your accession  Sir  to the presidency of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly is a source of pleasure and pride for Algeria - pleasure because it is a choice that rewards you for your qualities  experience and wisdom as an accomplished diplomat  which provide our Organization with good reason to expect our work to be accomplished successfully; and pride because in electing you this Assembly has paid a tribute to Bangladesh  a brother country that has found recognition in the United Nations and identifies with its ideals and values.The Organization that has entrusted you with one of its most responsible posts and paid you the highest honor is aware of the difficulty of the present and the uncertainty of the future. Your mission is not an easy one; we are all aware of that. The tasks that have been given to you are difficult ones; we are clearly aware of that also. You will need our understanding  support and co-operation  and you can expect to receive them. You may be assured of mine and those of my country.You have succeeded Ambassador Jaime de Piniss. in his brilliant career he has been a respected representative of his country and a far-sighted and dedicated servant of this Organization  to which he has given so much. I hope he will accept my congratulations on work wpII and successfully done and my cordial wishes for his health and happiness.I am very happy to see the Secretary-General fully recovered and again at the helm of this Organization  which has a secure present and future because of the courage and self-sacrifice of men of goodwill like him  who share his devotion and enlightened convictions. I can testify that the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  works not only for what the United Nations must be but also  and especially  for what it must be as a vision of the future order of the better world that is desired and expected. Against that historical background  we shall.with him  be the builders of a new stage  and we shall also stand at his side as he strives to maintain the role of the United Nations today and expand it for thebenefit of the changing world it must serve.A year ago the United Nations celebrated its fortieth anniversary. A few days ago  in Harare  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of its emergence in contemporary international relations. The United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement share the same historical path. Their roads have frequently converged and their plans have always centered on oppression that must be abolished  peace for the world  and co-operation that must be established and developed between nations. The United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement are advancing together patiently on the long road to freedom  peace and progress. Non-alignment is thus part and parcel of the whole range of values and ideals of the united Nations. It is completely committed to those values and to the collective work that must be done to ensure their triumph. The collective work that has not been completed is considered incomplete by the Non-Aligned Movement also. What has yet to be accomplished is an integral part of everything for whichthe Non-Aligned Movement is still working.A year ago here the United Nations and a few days ago in Harare the Non-Aligned Movement  in identical summaries  noted that the present world order is not the best possible one. The present order is in crisis. An order that is not prepared and has not the means to respond to the challenges of the latest outrages inflicted upon it by colonial or racial oppression is not the best order. An order that shows neither the imagination nor the capacity to conceive the security of those it protects except in terms of terror  which in turn generates all kinds of excesses  is not the best order. An order which  when it comes to the essential needs of our time - peace and development - can offer no alternative to this tragicand frightening situation of an armaments race fed by $1 000 billion and a total indebtedness of another $1 000 billion  an order that  ironically  equates resources for destructive purposes with resources for constructive purposes is not the best order.Finally  an order in which privileged wealth is paid for at the highest price by the deprivation of the greatest number is not the best order. Such an order is neither tolerable nor acceptable. It is an order of insecurity  instability and imbalance. It is an order of division and confrontation. It is not an order of law and equity. It is not an order which has a vision of mankind gathered togetherin solidarity. This order must change.The United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement share this determination to seek change  because the present order has clearly demonstrated its inability to be the creator and guarantor of an authentic collective security system. Similarly  it has offered boundless testimony of its inability to create the conditions and to provide the means for growth and development for the benefit of all. In this order  the principles which we  for a long time  believed had been laid down once and for all and enshrined and  therefore  respected  are still unfulfilled. The sovereign equality of States is challenged even here. Recourse to force in any form whatsoever in the settlement of disputes is internationally prohibited yet  it is still looked upon with some favor. Interference or outside intervention in regional or national affairs is present and serious. The freedom of people and of States to choose their political  economic or social systems is still challenged.At their meeting in Harare  the Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement reaffirmed the validity and justice of the policy of non-alignment as well as the importance of its contribution to balance and stability in the present system of international relations while bearing in mind what is being done by its detractors. The Non-Aligned Movement follows an independent policy  a policy without military  political or strategic alliances  an autonomous policy in its initiatives and actions. Having decided on the measures taken and the measures yet to be taken  the Non-Aligned Movement is determined to come to grips with the great problems of our time and to deal with them.In so doing  the Non-Aligned Movement has never considered  nor will it consider  itself as a fortress isolated from the affairs of the world  nor has it ever considered itself to be a simple observer merely taking note of developments.Non-alignment has its position to take and its judgment to make wherever the freedom of people is challenged  where States are threatened or harmed in terms of what they have chosen to do for themselves  or where peace and international security are to be established  or where development is to be protected against the predatory dangers of others. Some wish to identify non-alignment with a false and antagonistic logic of alliances - to say what one believes to be the correct law is not alignment; to say what one believes to be justice  order and the best thing to do with regard to local or regional conflicts  tensions and global problems which the world faces  is not alignment either.Non-alignment has never meant surrender   silence or complacency  it is to the honor of non-alignment; it is its asset  its merit and its strength that it has never yielded to those temptations. This is especially true because it is difficult to succumb to the temptation to surrender  to be silent or to be complacent  given the present state of the world. No matter from what angle we look at the world  all we can see are increased signs of agony  danger and destitution.Simply to note that the valuable resources of mankind are still being used to destroy rather than to build is in itself an eloquent summary of the situation. The spiraling arms race is growing more diversified  more sophisticated and developed. Neither the earth nor the sea lanes  nor outer space has been spared.It is not the fault of the policy of non-alignment  which has ceaselessly and unrelentingly declared that all living space is the common heritage of mankind. Nor is it the fault of the policy of non-alignment that it has tried everything to draw attention to the stupidity of a situation where man prefers instruments ofdeath to satisfaction of the most essential unmet needs of mankind. If the common ideal is to be - and indeed is of a single  united  indivisible mankind  there should be no room for anything that threatens its survival. The nuclear age given over to military purposes is the greatest of the dangers looming over the future of the human species. No doctrine  strategy or goal can justify the existence or the improvement of such a nuclear age.Today is the best time to want to curb the arms race. As limited and weak asthis approach may be  it is none the less a respectable approach. However  one must say again and again that there is no salvation for mankind without general and complete disarmament  conceived as an integral part of an authentic democratically organized and established collective security system. Belief in peripheral  selective systems of security have had their day  have shown their faults and have demonstrated their limits. The truth is that the new system of international security will be genuinely collective and democratic or there will not be a system at all. That is the only peace alternative  which is an absolutely essential condition for international relations to be fair  stable and sound.The question of peace and security cannot be separated from the question of development. Indeed  each day the development crisis acquires new dimensions which point to insecurity and instability in today's world relations. In some areas this crisis takes the form of survival? in other areas it is the laborious  costly development efforts which are being challenged or compromised.There are facts to be stated or restated in regard to that crisis. First  we should note that the crisis is structural in nature and global in impact. Indeed  the foundations and functioning of the current system of international economic relations are not adapted to current requirements for growth and development. The same is true of the central parameters of currency and finance  trade and raw materials. If we were to point to the most glaring signs of this inability to adapt  they would be indebtedness  the contraction of world trade and the acute stagnation in the raw material and commodities markets.Secondly  the recovery that has been presented as a cure-all to the crisis has shown itself to be fragile  precarious and without lasting force. The same is true of the chain-reaction effect that it was thought could be attributed to that recovery.Thirdly  the structural dysfunctioning of the current system of international economic relations  with its negative consequences for the developing world  is on the one hand destroying what has so laboriously been acquired on the other  including severe internal adjustments.Fourthly  experiments attempted and carried out have  moreover  strongly proved the senselessness of any solution that separates growth from development. It has now become clear that there is no effective role to be played and no possible solution other than those that include growth and development as interconnected and interdependent elements. From this comes the necessity for a renewed North-South dialog sustained by the resolve of all and directed towards the achievement of all those global adjustments that the present crisis has shown to be so vital.Fifthly and finally  in the context of the general development of international relations  the North-South gap  which is growing and deepening  is fraught with danger. The growth and deepening of that gap is not measured merely by quantitative size; the main concern should rather be qualitative in nature.What will the configuration of international relations be tomorrow as the result of an evolution by which some people move towards the post-industrial revolution while others remain subjugated by pre-development? That question encompasses the major political dimension of the present world economic order and of the crisis it has brought about. Mankind is thus facing other choices  and there is only one that is valid - that of orderly and obstacle-free changes and transformations.To say that the new international economic order is the necessary choice is not to sin by Utopianism or lack of realism. As the expression of a will and of an attempt to bridge the North-South gap  the new international economic order offers a path  which some still hesitate or refuse to take but which remains the only path assuring the stable and orderly development of world relations and leading to a universally shared prosperity.The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which has the double misfortune of counting among its mergers peoples who are still under domination or oppression and regions caught up in conflict or tension  was obliged to make its voice heard so that what needs to be corrected will be corrected with all due respect to their purposes and principles and to those enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.This is the case in southern Africa  where apartheid still imposes its outrageous laws. But the pace of history is accelerating in southern Africa  and apartheid no longer has a future there. It is the collective responsibility of the international community to hasten the end of a system that has been branded a crime against humanity. To that end  there is no way other than that of global and mandatory sanctions  commensurate with such a crime.For the national resistance movements - in South Africa under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and in Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) - as well as for the front-line States  which have known acts of aggression and occupation  we must provide some small comfort to their just struggle.The. same law of aggression  occupation and persistent spoliation applies to the Middle East and Palestine. There  there is injustice to be corrected and national rights to be restored. No lasting peace can be established without the Palestinian people  outside the Palestinian people and  a fortiori  against the Palestinian people. The national rights of the Palestinian people must be respected. That people has the inalienable right to an independent State in Palestine  its historic land. The occupied Arab territories  including Al Quds Al Sharif  must be vacated. Ravaged Lebanon must once again be able to live in aclimate of national understanding and unity and to enjoy its sovereignty and territorial integrity.There can be no solution to the crisis in the Middle East other than a globalsolution centering round the tragedy of the Palestinian people. For well knownhistorical reasons  the United Nations has a special responsibility in this respect.An international conference under the auspices of the United Nations remains the sole framework that would be possible  feasible or credible. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole legitimate and authentic representative of the Palestinian people  must take its place and make its voice hear.Not far from that region  the distressing conflict between Iraq and Iran is continuing and intensifying  to the detriment of the interests of the two fraternal peoples  and is threatening security and stability in that part of the world.In the need for good neighborliness and for a responsible  clear and courageous identification of the true interests of the two countries we can find the resources to put an end to the state of conflict and hostilities and to open negotiations leading to a peaceful solution.*In an identical approach and assessment the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity and  most recently  the Non-Aligned Movement  at its eighth summit meeting  described the conflict in Western Sahara as part of a decolonization process yet to be completed by the exercise of the right of the people of the territory to self-determination and independence.In this regard the African peace plan  which has now become a universal plan  sets out the framework  the conditions and the means for a peaceful  negotiated settlement of the conflict. The principal political guidelines of this plan concern the appeal for direct negotiations between the two warring parties - in this case Morocco and the POLISARIO Front - direct negotiations between those parties on the conditions for a cease-fire and for a referendum on self-determination and the requirement that that referendum be free from any administrative or military constraints.Within the framework of the political guidelines which the Assembly laid down at its previous session  the outgoing Chairman of the Organization of African Unity and the Secretary-General of the United Nations have striven to carry out their mission of peace. My country salutes their goodwill and persistence  and congratulates them on what they have achieved. Similarly  my country will encourage the mission of good offices in everything it may do  so that Western Sahara  too  may see the cause of freedom triumph.If that cause is to find its final expression and its ultimate satisfaction in a referendum on self-determination  that referendum must be orderly and genuine. A referendum ca self-determination whose primary purpose is to confirm and codify a fait accompli is not a true referendum. A referendum on self-determination carried out and sanctioned by the occupying force is not a referendum. A referendum onself-determination which confines the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations to a declamatory role is not a referendum.The referendum on self-determination proposed and decided upon now by the international community as a whole is something quite different. It is precisely that kind of referendum which must prevail  in the name of justice  law and peace in the Maghreb.In this matter it is precisely the building of a unified Great Maghred that is at stake: the area as a whole is an important geostrategic zone. Therefore  we do not doubt that it is the object of ambition and greed. Algeria has no alternative but to work for a unified  stable  secure and non-aligned Great Maghred.The ill-conceived initiative in introducing the aggressive  destabilizing Zionist factor does serious harm to this worth-while enterprise  which has brought together all people of goodwill in the region.In my country we venture to believe that the course of unification of the Maghreb is irreversible. No obstacles  whatever their variety  nature or form  can stop it.Resort to force has caused a brutal outburst in the Mediterranean  filling that region to overflowing with crisis and tension. The acts of aggression committed there are inadmissible and intolerable and must be condemned. That aggression damages the collective enterprise of the coastal non-aligned countries  which have set for themselves the noble goal of making the Mediterranean Sea a zone of peace and co-operation. However  those countries find in the acts of force carried out new testimony to the need for all the things they have proclaimed and what they are working for - that is  to free the Mediterranean from the conditions of war imposed upon it and to restore to it the peaceful status of a place of friendliness  meeting and enjoyment.Central America is the subject of this same logic of force and its effects. The rights of peoples and States and international legality have not been observed and respected. The peoples and States of the region must be able to live in harmony among themselves and with others  free from unjustifiable foreign intervention. The Contadora Group still enjoys our confidence and support.The United Nations is experiencing a decisive crisis in its history. It is our common responsibility to understand correctly the facts of that crisis in order to deal with it in the best interests of our Organization. In this context I reaffirm my country's faith in the United Nations and  further  our overriding obligation to protect the Organization. The United Nations must be maintained  preserved and protected. International relations without the United Nations not only are inconceivable  but would be dangerous. The United Nations is the order of dialog and co-operation; to harm it is  directly or indirectly  to harm the order of dialog and co-operation itself. Finally  the United Nations is the most promising augury for the world of tomorrow. If it is challenged or weakened  that long-desired better world will be compromised.It is our shared goal to ensure that the United Nations becomes more efficient  effective and influential in the conduct of world affairs. If this means the rationalization of structures  better use of available institutions  the elimination of unnecessary expenditure and the abolition of overlapping of functions and duplication  no one will object.On the other hand  if all it means is challenge multilateralism and the central role therein of the United Nations  there will be reason to question the implications of such a fatal cycle. None of us will benefit if that happens; we shall all be the losers."
"44",2089,"ECU",41,1986,"On behalf of the Government of Ecuador  it is a great pleasure for me to extend to you Sir  our congratulations on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly. It reflects just acknowledgment  of your personal qualities and the determination your country has shown to co-operate in promoting the goals of our Organization.I should like also to extend my most hearty congratulations to Ambassador de Pinies on the skillful manner in which he directed the work of the General Assembly as its President.Similarly  I wish to express the gratitude of the Government of Ecuador for the tireless work carried out by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  whose skill and wisdom have enabled him to discharge his delicate functions with success.Ecuador is present here during the Year of Peace  a time when the countries Members of this Organization wanted to call the attention of the Governments and peoples of the world to the value of coexistence free from violence or pressure.Peace is a blending of universal values. It is a result of the interplay of certain realities. Peace is an objective to strive for and to be deserved. The basic ingredient of this ideal is the clear decision by citizens and Governments to live in harmony and mutual respect. Diplomacy achieves little and international organizations make small progress if we do not start from unambiguous premises: good will among men; good intention on the part of leaders; and a clear perception by everyone of one's neighbors as possessing rights which deserve the utmost respect.This year devoted to peace  despite some effective results attained in variousareas  has not been characterized by any substantial progress on the hard road of trying to turn our world towards peace.There are encouraging signs  such as when there appear forces straining for understanding in the Middle East. It is extremely encouraging to find Egypt and Israel overcoming age-old problems. The effects of the admirable solution achieved for the Beagle problem by Argentina and Chile are still vividly recalled. However  in stern contrast  we have many other universal problems that remain unresolved and a significant resurgence of violence at the hands of organizations  overt or covert  which substantially disturb the tranquility of men and even threaten the security of States.All ethical  cultural and political manifestations which throughout history have claimed the right of the individual human being to the respect of his neighbors and the respect of States constitute the basic pillar supporting harmony. It follows that the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights did no more than give concrete form  in apt synthesis  to old aspirations of our cultures. The importance of that Declaration was that all the Member States of the United Nations consented to be bound by it. Failure to grant those rights gives rise to the individual notion of injustice  the tendency to complain  even violently; in other words  the foundations are laid for erosion of the peace.when Pope John Paul II  in his address on 1 January 1986  proclaimed that peace must be a value without frontiers  he was voicing a profound truth springing from the human condition itself. Man  without distinction as regards frontiers  aspires to peace  because he aspires to live in surroundings where all recognize his body of rights inherent in the human condition.*Legal concepts relating to human rights must revert to the ethical purity that they have been losing over the past few years  devastated by political accommodation or ideological compromise.It has become acceptable for many to recognize differences in type among human beings and to accept the rights of some being maintained and substantiated within a narrow framework in which greater scope is given to might and less to human dignity. At the same time  other human beings are subjected to a strict scale of values which we hope can be made stricter still  but only on condition that it be universal. This distinction  sometimes subtle and sometimes clear-cut  is conferred by the political alignments or ideologies practiced by Governments.Ecuador does not admit such a double standard. Ecuador reiterates the historical need to acknowledge that all men  regardless of latitude  cultural level or economic development  have the elementary rights which mankind has declared to be inherent in the human condition.Ecuador maintains that States must contain their coercive force within the solid wall of respect for all human beings and will not tire of proclaiming this universality of rights until they find effective expression in our complex and multiple times confused world.While the inalienable rights of human beings command the respect of men and States  the right of the peoples to choose together the form of Government and the authorities they choose is another essential principle for the maintenance of peace.Violence is used in a large part of the world to prevent peoples from having access to appropriate means of choosing an organizational system. And still in a large part of the world citizens are persistently denied the right to vote. The self-determination of peoples is an unassailable principle and is essential to world harmony. It is also a reality that could be improved upon in many States. In my own country  we still have sane way to go before the citizen's right to choose his leaders is fully recognized. Our Constitution contains a limitation - which the present Government has tried unsuccessfully  alas  to eliminate - whereby the right to be elected is conditional upon membership of a political party. The voter thereby loses the possibility of electing many people because they are not members of political parties  but who may merit the citizen's trust in public office.But  while there is room for improvement in countries that apply the principle of self-determination  there are unfortunately other countries where the possibility of self-determination is growing increasingly rare and where there is persistent denial of that principle.The interdependence that growing intercommunication creates among human beings is gradually making survival impossible for societies in which political domination deprives men of the right to self-rule.The rule of might over men  the imposition of an institution which may be backed by the force of arms but not by the will of the masses  is gradually becoming a historical anachronism. It is the duty of statesmen to understand that such systems  however much they may stress the sovereignty of a mandate  will neverbe able to claim democracy or the support of the will of the majority. And a clear-sighted statesmen must also understand that the tendency is for the word tofree itself from such systems and to claim  even through recourse to violent means the effective expression of something that emanates from the human condition itself. Thus  the occupation of territories by force becomes daily less admissible.The withdrawal of foreign forces from any territory directly or indirectly under occupation by a foreign army is a' categorical imperative  no matter what the continent or what justification be claimed for the maintenance of such a situation of violence.The self-determination of peoples has a rather political connotation. It is -   oriented towards the active exercise of political rights by human beings in a given community. But  over and above that right  today's world demands effective recognition of the right of national communities to development.Development does not automatically mean wealth. Development means an evolutionary process that makes possible increasing satisfaction of the needs of human beings  families and communities. Development means the individual and collective right to acquire cultural values  to pursue a dignified material life and gradually to participate actively in the life of the society. Development means that the individual can hope for gradual improvement and the assurance that the Government will co-operate with the individual to that end  without impediment of any kind. But development also means - and this is a concept that seems to recede further every day - that the international community should take note of the simultaneous  common need for that phenomenon to take place all over the world.It is natural that not all communities will achieve the same degree of development  but it is also an inescapable truth that the development of some cannot continue at the expense of the vast majority.The world of today  particularly the richer countries and those that have the most influence in the international community  must  for the sake of common survival  orient their economic and social policies in such a way as to rescue those peoples whose condition is obviously deteriorating. There are whole blocs of countries - one might even say continents and subcontinents - where the gradualdecline in the quality of life has become a persistent problem and has grown so extreme as to blunt the perceptions of many of those who are responsible for the international economic and political phenomena.We cannot stand idly by faced with the tragedy taking place in many African countries. There are not only an international financial crisis and increasingly unfavorable terms of trade  but also the gradual destruction of the environment and natural resources. This must serve to single out many African countries as subjects of the most urgent international concern.The world cannot deny its responsibility  because it encouraged the process of decolonization  which was  and still is  a notable step forward in historical development. It must appreciate the new collective responsibility in a situation where lack of awareness cannot be countenanced.As part of the right to development  the enjoyment of natural resources with equal benefit to the countries concerned  is essential. Ecuador supports the need for co-operation between the country with sovereignty over a resource and the country that may have the technology to exploit it  between the country that provides the manpower and the country that invests its capital and technology. We neither miserly withholding of a resource  which is then unused and brings no benefit to mankind  nor wanton exploitation  which  while of maximum benefit to one party  causes the depletion of the resource and deterioration of the environment In the same context  we consider that the Convention on the Law of the Sea is one of the most important contributions to international law in the past 30 years. Ecuador  together with other countries making up the South Pacific Commission; contributed to this development. It hopes to continue to initiate sound projects for reclamation of the natural rights of peoples from whom marine resources havebeen taken  without underestimating the degree of international co-operation needed  in order to bring then into the service of the international coKaaunity.With regard to outer space  the position of Ecuador concerning its use and that of the geostationary orbit and its frequency expecting stems from the same understanding. The peaceful use of those resources for the benefit of all States must be a permanent goal  while bearing in mind the special right to development of developing countries and equatorial countries.The submit meeting of the Non-Aligned Countries has just taken place in Zimbabwe. Ecuador is a member of the Movement. Twenty-five years ago  when the Movement started  its founding fathers stressed two attitudes towards the great Powers - independence and autonomy.Non-alignment represented a historic response to the great Powers trend to set up hegeraonistic blocs  binding to themselves specific groups of client countries. They lost their independence  faced with the might of the Powers and ceased to direct their destinies by themselves.The history of the world was itself turning into a play between two or three hegemonies  around which several dozen satellite States gravitated helplessly.This concept of the world was bound to generate a series of negative consequences. Among them  the tendency for each bloc to protect itself  to restrict access or the presence of other blocs  to create a politico-economic enclosure  to fragment the world into vertical blocs  from North to South.To break out of this unrelenting pattern  to develop the national personality  to overcome ideological prejudice  to maintain open relations with any sector or group of countries  such was the indispensable historic counterpart.The destiny of non-alignment had to be such as it is. Unfortunately  the spirit of the Movement has hesitated on many occasions. Attempts have been made to turn it into a club of poor countries  against rich countries. At other times  and in flagrant contradiction with the essence of the Movement  the antithesis has been sought: alignment with specific blocs; more than alignment: true alienation.Ecuador proclaims  as it did in Harare  that it is essential to reclaim the original spirit of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  in the ethical  juridical and political sense.Non-alignment does not mean loathing or violence; it does not mean verbiage bristling with epithets; it does not mean perennial and repetitive allegations against certain countries in the Western world. Starting from the concept of the sovereign equality of States  non-alignment means having an independent and open attitude  free from prejudice and antagonism  upholding the right of peoples not tobe swallowed up into huge  iron-bound blocs of influence. Our Government will not rest until this international reality is restored.With regard to disarmament  few issues have such immediacy and importance asthis.Although the right of every country to maintain a force to ensure internal order and the integrity of its sovereignty is indisputable  nevertheless the enormous size of this force constitutes an unmistakable path to provocation  confrontation and conflict.The disproportion of forces in various areas or regions  inevitably produces situations of injustice and displaces the rule of law. In view of these considerations  disarmament must be seen as a multiple process. Disproportionate spending on weapons or other military items means impairing the peoples' ability to strive for economic and social improvement.In those regions where there is an obvious disproportion in military forces  it is essential to set up real and effective systems for disarmament. The international community  the United Nations  must assume the task of promoting disarmament conventions  under effective international control  that go beyond a mere freeze of the arms race.The case of the great Powers deserves special attention. Ecuador encourages their continuing to deal with each other in order to come closer to true systems of disarmament. It is not through dramatic gestures that the arms race between the Powers will be curbed. There must be binding agreement  brought about not merely by their own conviction  but also by the growing moral pressure of the international community.The development of atomic weapons must particularly attract the attention of all peace-loving peoples. Atomic energy should be directed towards peaceful ends. Ecuador is particularly concerned about the atomic tests which threaten nature's balance on Earth.Just as the countries of Latin America did in the Treaty of Tlatelolco  our Government considers it appropriate for the international community to expand the scope and the concept of nuclear-free zones. The Pacific Ocean in particular  that huge sea whose very name originated from the strong impression of peace which it made on its discoverer  must become a nuclear-free zone. The Pacific is the sea where relations of the future will more significantly gravitate. This sea  which links the coasts of America to these of the age-old continent of Asia and of the very new continent of Australia  is bound to emerge not only as a zone with a clear economic destiny  but as a zone in which juridical values are invested with special character aimed at the affirmation and reaffirmation of peace.The very serious issue of the foreign debt has made little progress over the last year. Developing countries in particular are  to a greater or lesser degree  the victims of this acute problem of our times. The countries' massive foreign indebtedness was not due to chance  nor was it a concerted attitude on the part of the debtors.While it must be acknowledged  and in the case of ray own country I do so openly  that one of the components of the foreign debt was the application of erroneous economic policies  the joint responsibility of the creditor countries and of the multilateral agencies is unquestionable. Many countries  mine among then  believed in and practiced illusory policies of development promotion  based on an increase of bureaucratic costs  together with a type of protectionism favoring barely profitable activities which consumed a good part of national energy. The immediate consequence of this mistaken concept was to use up not only the capacity of internal savings and local indebtedness  but also to draw on the resources o  international borrowing to finance growing expenses and to bridge the balance-of-payments gap. Moreover  international lending agencies and creditor Governments fueled this indebtedness. Their main motivation was probably the recycling of resources emanating from the increase in the price of oil.When  through a consistent policy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  oil prices began to rise  a transfer of resources from oil importing countries  developed and developing alike  to oil-producing countries took place. These incremental resources are caught by the international banking system which seeks to place than not only within the traditional private group of clients  but also in a market: that of Governments  including the Governments of developing countries. This policy reached its climax in 1982 when the debtor countries' ability to pay came to an end.The solution which was found was to compel the debtor countries to make severe readjustments in their economies to ensure effective margins for the repayment of the debt  at the expense of the country's own development. Initial steps consisted in reducing import capacity  with the recessional effects this entails; and the next step  when this policy could no longer be maintained  was to encourage a rescheduling of the debt  on a case by case basis.Ecuador  with a relatively high per capita foreign debt  was able to renegotiate its debt over several years with the creditor countries and banks. This renegotiation meant committing about 30 per cent of foreign exchange earnings to debt amortization.When Ecuador's economy seemed to have adjusted to this new circumstance and international trade started to flow again  a new dramatic event occurred: oil prices suddenly fell.This time  resource transfers went in the opposite direction. Oil-producing countries  nearly all of them developing countries  transferred resources in 1986to the consumer countries worth approximately $80 billion. It should be noted that the privileged countries enjoy this benefit in direct proportion to their consumption. Thus  developed countries receive more than 80 per cent of this transfer of resources  while the advantage is greatly reduced for the consumer of developing countries.My country lost a third of its export earnings in 1986. This has forced it to make new readjustments in its economy.These readjustments have been made on the basis of safeguarding the autonomy of foreign trade  the basis for the free market quotations of foreign currency earned by private exports and those needed for private imports; while oil earnings  whatever the fluctuations of the price of the product  remain earmarked to pay for the State's expenditures  including amortization of the debt.But  apart from the way in which our country is facing up to its own problem  the basic drama remains.The debtor countries cannot be condemned to a permanent state of uncertainty and discouragement. Peoples cannot live without logic and hope. However great the effort they nay have to make  peoples must glimpse a more promising future.The creditor countries and the multilateral bodies must realize that a basic solution to the debt issue has to be found; that the distressed peoples are moving headlong towards undesirable consequences; that many Governments  unable to find viable solutions  are even yielding to wishful thinking  opting for what appears to be a remedy  but is not.It must be understood that the scope of the tragedy is not financial  but rather political and historical; and that the bloc of debtor countries  not as a club of conspirators set against the creditor countries  but as a group having common  identified needs  will seek solutions  realistic or unrealistic  but in some way different from what the international financial conclaves may have supposed.The tragedy of the debt is directly linked to the tragedy of international trade  and consideration of the latter issue is most timely now that a round of negotiations by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is taking place in Montevideo.The foreign debt must be paid  for reasons of international ethics. But payment is impossible unless there is a rise in the exports of the debtor countries. To increase exports  internal adjustments in the economic policies of the countries are admittedly required. Nevertheless  all efforts are useless as long as the developed world does not abandon its protectionist policy.Protectionism imposes a heavy burden on the national communities which subsidize the high cost of producing certain goods; and at the same time  it is unfair and prejudicial to the countries that could produce them more economically This is one of the hardest things for Latin America to bear. On other continents  our products are discriminated against; and no hegemonic bloc applies any kind of protectionist formula in our favor. In other words  the system brings us nothing but harm.I think I can make this plea for the abolition of protectionism  since my country implements a free market economic policy. We have no restrictions or subsidies. Access to foreign currency is free and we do not use any median ism to compensate exporters for the lower prices of exported goods. Thus we can  with full objectivity  call for the gradual but definite abolition of a protectionism which is causing the selective impoverishment of certain areas of the world without  in the medium term  benefiting any country.The Government of Ecuador believes that terrorism and the drug traffic are two collective threats that are interlinked. The huge resources which the drug traffic can generate and the hidden  dark force teed by terrorism mesh together and encourage each other. Our Government believes that terrorism and drug trafficking represent two special types of crimes  whose characteristics identity them as crimes against mankind. Both threaten indiscriminately  imprecisely  generically. They both cross boundaries; they both use international resources; they both operate and strike simultaneously in many parts of the world. It is essential that the international community act in concert to combat them.In accordance with the Quito Declaration against Traffic in Narcotic Drugs  of 11 August 1984  and with the statement of May 1985 of the United Nations Secretary-General  the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking has been called for June 1987. Ecuador  which as of 1986 is a member of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs  endorses its view that traffic in narcoticdrugs must be declared a crime against humanity  and the sinister symbiotic relationship it bears with terrorism must be acknowledged.The agenda for the forty-first session of the General Assembly contains an item relating to measures to be taken to prevent international terror ism. Last year  on the recommendation of the Sixth Committee  and in accordance with resolution 40/61  the General Assembly unequivocally condemned and qualified as criminal all acts  methods and practices of terrorism  wherever and by whomever committed  including these which jeopardize friendly relations among States and their security. In endorsing those criteria  we renew our appeal to qualify terrorism also as a crime against humanity.Crimes against humanity are to be dealt with under special norms of international criminal law. Specific shelters granted to other types of crimes would have -to be restricted or eliminated in the cases of crimes against humanity. Special norms on extradition should emanate from an international consensus. And let there be no confusion between terrorism and the policies  however repressive  of certain states that combat it. Attempts are made to. effect an ideological shift aimed at blurring the clear  repulsive outlines of terrorism  seeking to give the same name to the sometimes extreme conduct which may occasionally be adopted to punish the crime.In no manner can the immoderate use of force be excused  nor the denial of the fundamental rights of human beings  nor the withdrawal of persons and things from the natural jurisdiction of their judges.. But between this and the mixing and confusing of ideas  there is a wide gap which is bridged with ideological and grammatical twists. Terrorism  the action aimed at intimidating  by use of fear  to compel or restrain  so that societies lose their tranquility and the center of gravity of their own destiny  is something that has no. excuse whatsoever. Ecuadoris ready to cooperate openly and frankly with other countries of the world for the condemnation and eradication of this atrocity of our century.There have not been any favorable developments with regard to the tragedy in Central America in the last few months. The disproportionate size of the armies and of the stock of weapons   the immoderate and open intervention of several Powers within the area  and the continued and deplorable installation of certain totalitarian systems keep on aggravating the tensions in that stricken area  of our Americas. Ecuador deeply regrets  out of continental solidarity  out of Latin American spirit  out of its perception of a geopolitical threat  this tragedy for which a remedy has not yet been found.All and any of the resources of international law are appropriate for the solution of the problem. There is no exclusive forum  nor action that enjoys exclusive rights. All the resources that international law can bring to bear must be used to solve the Central American tragedy. In the end  so long as democracy does not find true and effective expression  so long as there is no elimination of the practice of forcibly compelling peoples to accept regimes that they have not themselves freely chosen  so long as it is impossible for many to live in their own country  dominated by tyrannical elements  peace will be a distant and almost contradictory aspiration. Peace has to come from the existence of justice and law  not from the blind imposition of force ruling over the actions and even the conscience of.people.The international community  the regional and ad hoc forums  as well as the Contadora Group-itself will have to exert strong pressure to eliminate the causes of war 01 guerrillas in the Central American and to restore in the area the effective validity of the peoples' rights to self-determination  of democratic systems and of- non-intervention.The Government of Ecuador  faithful its traditional policy of firm commitment to the rule of law in relations among States  convinced of the need to contribute to the reinforcement of a creative peace that would enable all peoples to satisfy their legitimate aspirations for progress and well-being  renews its decision to faster and strengthen friendly relations with the Governments of neighboring countries  in order to contribute to the well-being of their peoples  with whom they are destined to be closely linked> and to create the climate for a just  peaceful and honorable solution to the territorial problem  within a framework of mutual co-operation.Ecuador reiterates its belief in the validity of the efforts that the United Nations is making to improve conditions in the international community. What has not yet been achieved must not discourage such efforts. A positive achievement shows that joint participation in forums in which the legal equality of States is recognized  is an indispensable mechanism of civilized coexistence.Ecuador hopes that all States of the world which aspire to membership in the United Nations may accede to it. Particularly noteworthy is the case of South Korea  a country whose justifiable desire to joining the Organization should not be blocked by the position of third parties.We also support all principles or practices to eliminate discrimination against individuals. Race  religion  political conviction  age or sex should not be used as reasons for depriving individuals of certain rights or benefits. We therefore support the efforts of the international community to eliminate all forms of discrimination.Of special interest is the effort to reinforce the mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes. For a number of reasons we consider useful the proposal to establish a commission of good offices  mediation and conciliation. And we are also encouraged to learn that the Secretariat is preparing a draft manual for the peaceful settlement of disputes.The Organization must keep progress in the field of women's rights under review. Ecuadorean legislation has eliminated all discrimination against women. The ever-increasing presence of women in the professional world  in the scientific community and in political life  is helping our society to incorporate or further emphasize the values which women seem to hold particularly dear. My country has been active in applying the strategies designed to further the advancement of women between now and the year 2000  adopted by the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women. It has also acted with particular diligence in the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and in the Board of Trustees o. the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women.Finally  I wish to make a special reference to an international principle which my Government considers to be the backbone of the civilized and peaceful development of our times. I am speaking of the freedom of the press. We must gradually make progress in the world's ability to inform and comment regularly  using all means of mass communication  without restrictions or pressure  without interference from the State or other such quarters. There are still many countries that do not recognize the need to consider this principle  that limit the freedom to express opinions and comment  that exercise control  on the basis of what is seen as the official truth  the citizens' right to receive true and prompt information  and the right of the thinking man and the journalist to exercise their informational abilities.Ecuador is confident that these still considerable barriers may be brought down  gradually but firmly. Ecuador itself regards it as a duty to follow those principles which safeguard the unrestricted freedom of the press and the practical application of that principle. A diversified  broad and entirely free informational community is one of the traditional requirements of life in Ecuador and one of the reasons for the climate of peace and the constantly increasing emphasis on progress which has always been characteristic of our country."
"45",2134,"EGY",41,1986,"It gives me pleasure at the outset to convey to you. Sir  our heartfelt congratulations on your election President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your election is recognition of your constructive efforts and your great diplomatic skills. It is also an expression of appreciation by the international community for the leading role played by Bangladesh in promoting the cause of international peace and security.More than a quarter of a century has elapsed since the General Assemblyadopted its resolution 1378 (XIV) of 20 November 1959  whicSi affirms that the goalof general and complete disarmament is the most important and urgent questionfacing our world. Nevertheless  and in spite of the repeated calls of theinternational community for the achievement of that goal  very little has been achieved.The danger of nuclear war is ever present  fueled by rivalry and lack of confidence between the two super-Powers and the possibility of miscalculation as well as the increase in the stockpile of nuclear warheads  which has reached the awesome total of 80 000  sufficient to destroy the world many times over.As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  Egypt welcomes the resumption of dialog between the USSR and the United States on the numerous proposals aimed at concluding new agreements on the limitation of nuclear armaments  extending the validity of existing agreements  or ratifying those that have not yet been ratified. This is a hopeful sign  and it is our sincere hope that a constructive dialog will ensue and that discussions will culminate in the adoption of an agreement or agreements to limit the level of nuclear armaments of the two super-Powers  we attach great importance to the convening of the next summit meeting between the American and Soviet leaders  a meeting which can give a new tangible impetus to the efforts aimed at halting the arms race.The Third Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last year succeeded in adopting by consensus a final document embodying the political will of the international community. We look forward to giving a new thrust to the non-proliferation regime. The nuclear-weapon States  in particular the two super-Powers with the largest nuclear arsenals  have a special responsibility for nuclear disarmament. Egypt believes that  as a binding international document  the Non-Proliferation Treaty is insufficient in itself to ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons horizontally and vertically. The Non-Proliferation Treaty must be accompanied by parallel arrangements to direct the nuclear threat away from mankind. Among such arrangements should be the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. Since 1974 Egypt has taken the initiative in calling for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. It has also sponsored all the draft resolutions adopted by the General Assembly at its successive sessions with a view to achieving that goal.Recently the world has been plagued by a series of terrorist acts that have taken a heavy toll in innocent civilian lives and instilled a sense of horror and concern in the hearts of all. Faced with such a blatant threat to human rights and the movement of trade and tourism  we believe that the international community is duty-bound to adopt collective measures  whether political or legal  to face up to and deter that phenomenon so as to ensure the personal and economic security of all the countries of the world and their citizens.At its fortieth session the General Assembly adopted by consensus its resolution 40/61  in which it affirmed the importance of the accession of States to the relevant agreements as one of the legal measures that would ensure international co-operation in resolving that problem. The resolution also urged Member States to adopt individual and collective measures within the framework of political oo-operation to do away with the causes underlying that phenomenon. Nevertheless close scrutiny of the provisions that have actually been implemented makes it abundantly clear that there still exists an urgent need to take more effective  collective action.Proceeding from Egypt's belief in the importance of an effective policy with solid legal foundations to fight that scourge  in his address before the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council  President Moharaed Hosni Mubarak proposed the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to conclude an international agreement that would regulate co-operation among States to combat and deter terrorism  an agreement that would remove loopholes in existing relevant international instruments. The proposed agreement should take into account  on the one hand  the close link between finding just solutions for the underlying causes of the problem and  an the other  the adoption of the necessary measures to fight it. The Egyptian Government is currently conducting consultations on that proposal with a view to determining the major acceptable elements to be incorporated in the proposed agreement and the appropriate timing for formally putting the natter before the General Assembly.For more than 30 years the Middle East region has been an arena of war and destruction as a result of the continuation of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the emergence of the Palestinian problem  which is almost as old as this international Organization itself. This conflict has claimed thousands of lives and has led to the depletion of valuable resources. it has also plunged the region into a maze of international polarization  cold war and direct and indirect interference.Having experienced the various stages of that conflict in war and peace  our knowledge of its elements and dimensions further deepens our conviction that the question of the Palestinian people is at the crux of the conflict.Egypt's unique historical experience in waging the battles of war and peace strengthens our belief that dialog and negotiation offer the best way to achieve a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement to the conflict  away from the spirit of confrontation and violence which has thrust the region and its peoples into stalemate.This path is not an easy path  yet undoubtedly it is the sound option and correct method for the peaceful settlement of disputes without relinquishing rights or compromising on matters of principle. The agreement achieved between Egypt and Israel on the terms of arbitration concerning the location of some disputed boundary posts serves as an example of abidance by international legitimacy  the provisions of the Charter and the rules of international law. It is Egypt's hope that this approach will testify to the fact that those who have a legitimate right to the land should never hesitate or fear negotiations and dialog as long as they are confident of their arguments and evidence and of the support that international legitimacy lends to their rights.The need is greater now than ever before to achieve peace among the peoples and States of the region and to lay the foundations for the long awaited historical reconciliation between the Arab countries and Israel  a reconciliation that would render possible the achievement of a peaceful settlement to the conflict  including the solution of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects. One of the most disturbing aspects of the situation is the inertia that has beset the peace process in recent years  since it portends the possibility of a relapse.In its serious endeavor to revive the peace process  Egypt views the Alexandria summit? held this September between President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak and the Prime Minister of Israel  as a step towards increased flexibility  a deeper awareness of the centrality of the Palestinian question and a key to a comprehensive tackling of the Arab-Israeli conflict. That can be achieved through the acceptance of an international conference on peace in the Middle East as the framework for negotiations in which all parties directly concerned with the dispute  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  would participate on an equal footing. A thorough preparation for those negotiations should be carried out  with the Security Council playing its primary role as the organ entrusted with the maintenance of international peace and security.By virtue of its location  relations  and long association with the Palestinian question  Egypt is best equipped to act as a direct party to that dispute with all the other parties with a view to achieving a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East  and in particular the Palestinian question.Therefore  Egypt has ca * ad for 1987 to be the year of negotiations for peace in the Middle East.In the Arab region  Egypt has been acting with a sense of seriousness and responsibility. It has been calling for the co-ordination of positions  the renunciation of differences and the adoption of a peaceful strategy which would ensure the launching of a new stage of international collective action for peace in the region.By virtue of its balanced relations with all the permanent members of the Security Council  Egypt is in a position to engage in a responsible dialog to create the best conditions for the convening of the international conference on peace in the Middle East. Egypt is a aware of the fact that a new phase of international diplomatic action is about to start to give a new momentum to the historical peace process in order to achieve its goals. Undoubtedly  that new drive reaffirms the validity of Egypt's approach to move the region from a stage of war to one of peace and co-existence through the recognition of rights  the elimination of injustice and the healing of wounds rInternational legitimacy  as spell out in the Charter of this international Organization  ensures the inalienable right to self-determination for all peoples of the world  without exception. That is the proper framework for our forthcoming collective international action. The United Nations resolutions pertaining to the Arab-Israeli conflict over its long years  and in particular the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly  which enjoy a constant international consensus  constitute the foundation of this international legitimacy  through which we seek to implement the provisions contained therein.Tirelessly  Egyptian diplomacy has striven and continues to strive to create the international and regional conditions which provide the best atmosphere for the preparation of the international conference on peace in the Middle East as a framework for negotiations and dialog in which all parties to the conflict would participate. Egypt co-ordinates its actions with international Powers and with various Arab parties  and in particular with its sister State Jordan and the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Among the basic elements in the creation of such a climate is the adoption of a solid Arab position based on the commitment to the legitimate rights of the Arab and Palestinian peoples  to the restoration of their occupied territories in the West Bank  including Arab Jerusalem  Gaza  and the Syrian Golan Heights  and the commitment to the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination and the establishment of their own State on their land in co-ordination with Jordan.Egyptian diplomacy has always maintained that the achievement of an acceptable formula for co-operation between Jordan and the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  is an indispensable and vital factor for movement in the right direction.Thus  Egyptian diplomacy believes that the Jordanian-Palestinian Accord of February 1985 constitutes not only one of the bases of co-ordinated action but also an additional safeguard for the strength of the Palestinian and Arab position during and beyond the stage of negotiations.The establishment of the edifice of a comprehensive and just peace would end the suffering of the Palestinian masses in the occupied territories. It would also put an end to the Israeli policies and practices affecting their human rights which have been violated during long years of continued Israeli military occupation.Egypt's firm  principled position concerning the situation in Lebanon has been to support its legitimate Government and to call upon all the Lebanese  whatever their creed  belief or affiliation  to close ranks and to unite their country so as to restore stability to Lebanon and to close the door before the possibilities of foreign interference and to achieve their freedom by Lebanese decision. Egypt calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon and for the respect of its stability  sovereignty and territorial integrity. Egypt pays tribute to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UN3FIL) for its constructive role in the maintenance of peace in that country. Egypt calls upon all parties to respect that important international presence.The situation in the Gulf remains volatile. The continued armed conflict between Iraq and Iran threatens security  peace and stability in the whole region. Therefore  it has become imperative for the international community to redouble its efforts to stop the bloodshed of that destructive war. The gravity of thesituation lies in the continued and increased aggravation of the conflict year after year between two neighboring Muslins peoples linked by the bends of Islam. Egypt's position concerning that dispute has been clear  consistent and a matter of public record. Egypt has done  and continues to do  its utmost to reach a peaceful settlement to the conflict  a settlement that would restore the rights of both parties within the framework of respect for the provisions of international law  the United Nations Charter  and the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement. The foundering of the efforts aimed at achieving that desired goal must not dissuade us from continuing to strive to put an end to the war and to achieve peace and stability.n that regard  we cannot fail to express our appreciation to  and support for  the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  in his tireless efforts. We hope that they will be crowned with success in the near future.Iraq has shewn and affirmed its sincere desire to end that bloody conflict. It has declared its readiness to respond to the efforts made within and outside the United Nations to bring about the cessation of hostilities. It has welcomed the idea of engaging in negotiations to achieve a comprehensive settlement of the dispute. Moreover  it has also put forward initiatives and accepted proposals directed towards halting the bloodshed.Egypt hopes that the positive and co-operative position taken by Iraq since the beginning of the conflict will be reciprocated by a similar position on the part of Iran  particularly because Egypt is convinced that the Iranian threats are not confined to the territory of Iraq  that sister Arab country  but extend to the security and stability of other Arab peoples in the Gulf region. Egypt can neither accept nor condone such threats.The southern African region is witnessing a dangerous escalation of tension and violence  which have characterized the course of events in the region over recent years as a result of the racist policies of the Pretoria regime and its military adventurism. Within South Africa itself the racist Government has reacted to the uprising of the black majority and its demands for equality and human dignity with further acts of repression and intimidation. Hundreds of black citizens have fallen victim to those acts.The racist regime of Pretoria continues its illegal occupation of the territory of Namibia  with total disregard for the resolutions of this international Organization on that matter  foremost among which is Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  containing the United Nations plan for Namibia'sindependence. The Pretoria regime continues to insist on linking the implementation of that resolution with other matters extraneous to it  matters which fall well beyond the control of the parties directly concerned with the problem.The arrogance of the Pretoria regime reached its peak in its military attack on the capitals of three neighboring African States. All the countries of the world  represented in the Security Council  were unanimous in deploring anddenouncing that act.In the light of those acts on the part of the Pretoria regime and the resultant rapid and dangerous deterioration of the situation in southern Africa  the only way to avoid a catastrophe of unpredictable dimensions in the region is to force the regime to abide by the rules of civilized conduct  the provisions of international law and United Nations resolutions. That can best be achieved through the adoption by the Security Council  in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter  of comprehensive mandatory sanctions againstthe Pretoria regime.Egypt's participation with other African States in the deliberations of thespecial session on Namibia at the ministerial level  not only reflects its firmhistorical commitment to the cause of African liberation  but also expresses ourconviction that there is a need to intensify collective international action toexpedite the attainment of independence by that struggling African people and itsassumption of its rightful place in the international community and in thisOrganization.The establishment of a special fund to help the front-line States cope with the consequences of the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions with against the Pretoria regime is an act of true solidarity. It gives expression to the unity of the struggle for the elimination of the remnants of colonialism and racism in that part of the world. Egypt also believes that the policy of dialog and persuasion followed by the non-aligned countries at the summit meeting held at Harare will help open up new channels of understanding between the non-aligned and African countries on the one hand and the industrialized countries on the other with a view to reaching basic solutions to the situation in southern Africa.Egypt expresses its support for the unflagging efforts made by the Secretary-General to reach a just settlement of the situation in Afghanistan  a settlement that would ensure for that brotherly people its right to peace  freedom and stability. We welcome all initiatives to expedite the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghan is tan.We are also hopeful that the Secretary-General's efforts to resolve the question of Cyprus will meet with success. The solution should realize the hopes of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to solve their problems and reach an appropriate formula for co-existence and co-operation. We reaffirm the importance of respect for the civil and political rights of the members of the two communities  as well as the importance of harmonizing their legitimate interests within a framework of national unity and brotherhood. We also reaffirm the importance of the maintenance of the unity  independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Cyprus.The withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea and the peaceful settlement of disputes in that part of the world are an essential conditions for the restoration of peace and good-neighborly relations. The peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula  in accordance with the popular will  is one of the elements that should contribute to security and stability and the reduction of the risks inherent in the prevailing regional tension. Egypt supports the efforts of the Contadora Group and its Support Group to achieve peace  stability and economic development in Central America. Egypt calls for an aid to attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of that important part of the world. It also calls for respect for good-neighborly relations and for the inviolability of borders between the States of the region. Egypt also calls for keeping the region free of polarization and international competition between the great Powers  in the interest of the well-being of its peoples.Egypt's responsibility as a developing country dictates that we pause to mention a major problem that concerns us all  individually and collectively  rich and poor  developed and developing alike: the exacerbation of the problem of indebtedness  high interest rates  continued fluctuations in exchange rates  the spread of protectionist practices in the developed countries  the sharp fall in the prices of developing countries' exports of raw materials and commodities and the deterioration in their terms of trade.In that regard  I pay a tribute to the responsible position adopted by the eighth summit meeting of the non-aligned countries at Harare in dealing with the debt problem. The debtor countries have confirmed that they will honor the obligations they have contracted  while setting a framework for those obligations -namely the framework of co-responsibility  which requires the co-operation of the creditor countries and the monetary and financial institutions with the debtor developing countries in coping with the problem  which threatens the international economy as a whole.The endeavors of the international community to contain the economic crisis in Africa in both the short and the long terms must of course command our encouragement and appreciation. Whatever our assessment of the outcome of the special session of the General Assembly  it has created a moral obligation on the donor countries to assist in the implementation of the United Nation Program of Action for African Economic Recovery  1986-1990.While the special session reaffirmed the determination by the African countries to assume the primary responsibility for economic reform  it also showed that the developed countries cannot shirk the task of assisting the African continent to develop its economies through specific measures to support and complement African efforts. The international community has therefore recognized the necessity to provide the additional financial resources required to fill the gap for the full implementation of the United Nations program of Action. It has also recognized the necessity to undertake measures to alleviate Africa's external debt-servicing burdens in order to enable the continent to direct its resources and potential towards growth and development.We emphasize that this cannot be the limit of the international community's task. Rather  we should pursue this obligation through concrete steps to follow up on the results of the special session  both at the political and at the technical levels.We equally appeal to the Governments of creditor countries and the international monetary  financial and banking institutions to co-ordinate and co-operate with the debtor countries with a view to reaching a lasting solution to the problems of indebtedness  while safeguarding the rights of peoples and ensuring their political  economic and social stability.Economic co-operation among developing countries has gone through a number of important developments during the past 20 years. New concepts and goals for this co-operation have evolved in the Group of 77 and in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. These concepts are based on the philosophy of collective self-reliance and have been translated into tangible objectives and detailed programs and projects contained in the programs of action for co-operation among the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77.The Cairo high-level meeting on economic co-operation among developing countries members of the Group of 77  held last August  afforded a favorable opportunity to take stock of the experience of that co-operation and to establish an integrated program for the future strategy of action on a realistic basis. As such  it ensures the optimum use of resources and the implementation of economically feasible projects in which countries participate on a basis of mutual benefit  and it also ensures the optimum use of the complementarity of the economies of the developing countries and the expertise available to them. The Cairo Declaration on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries which was adopted contains realistic bases for a future strategy of action that would ensure the credibility  effectiveness and mutual benefit of such co-operation.The developed countries have constantly supported economic co-operation among developing countries. We hope that special attention will be given to the matter during this session so that the follow-up of the important results achieved at the Cairo meeting will be ensured  and effective measures to enhance economic and technical co-operation among developing countries will be adopted  within the United Nations system.Recently the relevance of the United Nations has been called into question. For our part  we believe that this question is baseless and absolutely irrelevant. The establishment of the Organization more than 40 years ago reflected the international community's need of it. Its survival and strength  in this era of increased international interaction  at times of war and peace alike  serve the interests of all States  big and small  developed and developing.During the fortieth session of the General Assembly  Member States reaffirmed their commitment to the Charter and their continued support for the Organization as an expression of their belief in the role it plays. It is truly regrettable that the positions adopted by some Member States  whatever their justifications may be  do not help in reaching that goal.Any effort aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the Organization must stem first and foremost from the necessary political will. Naturally  it must be a joint effort characterized by continuity  when we talk of concerted efforts we have in mind the need for all Member States to co-operate fully and in good faith with the Secretary-General as the chief administrative officer of the Organization. In that regard  we welcome the important role played by the Group of 18 throughout the past year. We believe that it is important for delegations and Member States to discharge their full responsibility to discuss the report of the Group as well as the comments of the Secretary-General thereon.The participation in this effort in good faith requires that an opportunity be given to brihg about the reforms necessary for the Organization in the light of an objective assessment of its activities. Therefore  an end must be put to the practice of bringing financial pressure to bear on the Organization  and to the attempt to channel reforms towards predetermined goals that express only short-term interests.Last but not least  the rationalization of the work of the United Nations must take into account the special nature of the Organization and the changing circumstances in the international arena  as well as the interests of all the peoples of the world."
"46",2204,"ESP",41,1986,"Sir  allow me first to express my satisfaction and that of the Government of Spain at seeing you preside over this session of the General Assembly. Your proven professional abilities and your outstanding personal qualities will contribute decisively towards ensuring that the work of the General Assembly will yield the benefits that we all awaitI should also like to underline the skill and efficiency shown by your predecessor  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  throughout the previous session  and to express my admiration for the quiet but indefatigable work of theIt was the wish of the Government of Spain that the titular bearer of the crown  in the exercise of his constitutional function of representing the State  should make heard within this forum the voice of his country; a country that proudly holds as its highest historical credentials its respect for the law of nations and its confirmed effort to make- international coexistence more secure  more pacific  and more solid. Spain is glad to address this universal forum  which stirs the hope that the ideals of peace  justice and solidarity may firmly prevailSpain was one of the first communities to constitute itself as a nation State in renaissance Europe  thus taking  together with other communities  a decisive step in the process of rationalizing political coexistence. In that same period of history  several Spanish jurists and theologians  when examining the title for Spain's presence in America  were already arguing that there were limits to national power  in order for the exercise of this power to be legitimate  it must be inspired by an ethical conscience and must respect the rights and aspirations of other peoples. Or  to put it in the language of the period  the legitimate exercise of national power must strive to secure the ""common weal of the earth"".We owe to Francisco de Vitoria  one of the founders of the jus gentium  international law  the following phrase:""If in the fulfillment of a just cause some damage is done to the universe then the cause turns out to be an unjust one.""In the very roots of our Constitution as a State we therefore find the awareness of an international society whose common good limits the action of the State. Also present is a pledge of solidarity among all members of the human race. Both of these factors provide a basis for the legal structuring of the international community which we find today enshrined as an institution in the United Nations.It is against the background of this old tradition that I am addressing the Assembly today. I do so also as the representative of a nation  young because of the age of its citizens and because it has recovered  along with its freedom and democracy  a vital attitude characteristic of youth - that is  the capacity to look to the future with boldness and hope.When a people recovers its vital impulse  integrating its traditions into a design for the future  it cannot forget that this revitalization should be inspired equally by the ideals of its own society and by the requirement of harmonious  peaceful and just international coexistenceToday  for the first time  the world is one  yet at the same time it is culturally diverse.In the past  the alleged superiority of a given culture or civilization was used to justify the domination of some nations over others. Cultural diversity was challenged by an impulse that thrived on seeking economic advantage or strategic predominance.Today  the commonly accepted rule is that each culture should be understood and judged exclusively in relation to its own values and not by whether it can adapt itself  through mimesis or through foe   to some allegedly superior culture. It is from this conception of the universality and cultural diversity of mankind that the great impetus towards political decolonization derived.The United Nations bears witness to this powerful reality  which opens a new phase in history. The United Nations has been the standard and the basic instrument of this step towards a true society of nations.It is true that certain well known vestiges of colonial conditions still persist. And one of these anachronistic situations concerns my country. Spain maintains  vigorously and with the weight of the reason inherent in its cause  the will to find a rapid solution to the problem of Gibraltar  so that the Rock can be reintegrated into Spanish national territory. A new chapter has opened up since the Brussels Declaration of 27 November 1984 and since the Governments of the United Kingdom and of Spain decided  in February 1985 in Geneva  to resolve the problem in all its aspects  including that of sovereignty  through negotiation. This new phase is dominated by the hope of putting an end to an unjust situation without harming the interests of the local population.We find ourselves not only before a politically and culturally diverse world but also before an economic order in which differences continue to exist and become wider. The past decade has been marked by economic crisis  the indebtedness of important developing areas and the reappearance of new protectionist tendencies. Not only justice and solidarity  but peace and security themselves  require the bridging of these differences and the correction of these tendencies.A few months ago  when dealing with the critical economic situation in Africa  the Assembly was the forum where  on the one hand  the African nations were convinced of their need to carry out a great effort of self-appraisal  of adjustment and action; and where  on the other hand  the remaining nations became fully aware of the fact that it is impossible to accept passively the stagnation and deterioration of a part of the world which is essential to the whole. This expression of political far-sightedness and solidarity is a hopeful development. Spain  within the limits of its resources and possibilities  has pledged its co-operation and today reiterates that pledge.The foreign indebtedness of certain nations  and among them some particularly close to Spain  is a serious problem that affects us all. There is no easy solution. No doubt many factors and paths of action have contributed to bringing about this situation. The responsibilities are manifold and have to be shared. Let historians pass a final judgment on them. What matters today is to encourage those policies of adjustment necessary to correct domestic situations  not only by applauding them but also through generosity and specific support. These policies have certain limits which  if exceeded  can put at risk domestic peace and solidarity  thus hindering delicate processes of political and social change.In the process of political reconstruction that has been going on for the past decade  my country has set the framework of its international position.Since the previous session of the General Assembly Spain has defined its position on two important options. In 1986 it became a member of the European Community and  after consulting the Spanish people  it defined the terms of its continued membership in the Atlantic Alliance.By joining the organizations and institutions of Western European integration  Spain only confirms what history and culture have made of it since the beginning of modern times. Spain has always been an integral and essential part of Europe for geographical and historical reasons and by vocation. Through its participation in the decision-making processes of the Twelve  Spain can make its voice heard on European matters and can bring to the activities of communitarian Europe new dimensions which stem from its historical past. Europe certainly cannot give way to any temptation to be inward-looking. On the contrary  we strive to increase the contacts and exchanges of the European Community with other parts of the world  and especially with the countries of the American continent. Europe cannot confine itself to the cultivation of its own garden  nor can it content itself with the preservation of an enviable quality of life  when other regions of the world find themselves strangled by stagnation  by the diminution of international trade and by the negative interplay of commercial and financial factors.Prom our position as Western allies  we contribute to common security and  as a fundamental part of this  we strive to help make the dialog between the super-Powers come to fruition and the negotiating forums intensify their work. We nourish the hope that the consolidation of a climate of dialog and of greater confidence in international relations will lead  in a relatively brief period  to drastic cuts  for the first time  in nuclear arsenals; to the halting of the arms race; to a world-wide ban on chemical weapons; and to significant advances in the field of conventional disarmament.On a regional level  the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which was born in Helsinki and gained new impetus in Belgrade and Madrid  is being followed up in various forums. In Stockholm today an important consensus has been achieved which will certainly strengthen European security and harmony in international relations in a broad geographical framework. It is to be hoped that this success will have a positive impact on the new phase of the Conference  which will soon resume in Vienna.This dual definition of Spain  as European and as Western  complements and enriches our relations with the countries and peoples of Latin America. We are bound to them through special cultural and historical ties  which give us a sense of solidarity with them in the search for just solutions to the political  economic and social problems they are facing today.To the existing elements of concern  a new one of unsuspected scope has been added in recent years: terrorism  which preys on innocent lives  stimulates catastrophic visions and deprives citizens of their peace.Terrorism  the supreme assault upon the most primary and  at the same time  most profound of human rights - the right to live in peace - has international dimensions. Support for  and even tolerance of  terrorism disqualifies any State as a member in good faith of the international community.The Spanish Government has repeatedly declared itself in favor of intensifying international co-operation against this universal scourge. The unanimous and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism  in whatever form  by this Assembly last December doubtless constitutes a hopeful step which should be followed by concrete and effective measures of international co-operation.Unfortunately  this Assembly must once aqain focus its attention on a series of conflictive situations in various regions of the world. Some are recent  others almost chronic  but all together produce the gravest rupture in the principles of the Charter of our Organization. Meanwhile we watch helplessly as some peoples  which should be forging their future in peace and harmony  are instead bleeding themselves amidst incredible destruction and suffering.In the face of these painful conflicts  the reasons behind our well-known positions not only remain valid but in some cases have been reinforced. From this podium  I appeal for negotiation and dialog to overcome intolerance and intransigence once and for all  so that the forc« of reason and law may prevail over the reason of force.Peace is tranquility and harmony within order. There can be no harmony if clearly unjust situations continue to exist in the world. Still less can it be present if the voices that denounce injustice are drowned out. Respect for human rights will be a yardstick by which our civilization and our specific conduct will be judged. Not only the conduct of those who violate human rights but also that of those who do not condemn violations or adopt towards them an attitude of passive resignation.The total contempt for the human being that is entailed by racial discrimination and the policy of apartheid constitutes the most flagrant attack on the concept of the unity of the human race. Against it we must take all the necessary steps to secure its dismantlement and abolition. We must bring to their senses those who  blinded by their prejudices and fears  condemn the vast majority of their compatriots to intolerable domination and oppression and in so doing seal the future of their own country.In recent years  international co-operation through multilateral channels has been progressively undermined. Nevertheless  it is certain that in our increasingly interdependent world  numerous problems make it imperative that we search for solutions in a multilateral framework. Serious institutional and financial problems were added last year to the difficulties that traditionally confront the United Nations.The Secretary-General  whose activities deserve our recognition and support  has brought to completion courageous initiatives. For its part  the Assembly must examine and adopt the necessary measures to improve the efficiency and administration of the Organization. The United Nations is the best overall instrument for the maintenance of peace and security. It does invaluable co-operative work in many fields. It is the repository of the ideal of an international order ruled by law. The international community cannot allow its activities to be impaired and its prestige diminished because of an inadequate use of existing resources.The session now beginning will undoubtedly be important in the search for solutions to the many problems inherent in the present international situation. That situation  while gravely disquieting in certain ways  also encompasses possibilities for progress towards the goals set out in the Charter.I am sure that the Assembly will continue to advance along the road - however difficult that might sometimes be - towards peace  security and co-operation."
"47",2276,"ETH",41,1986,"Permit me  at the very outset to convey to the President the pleasure of the Ethiopian delegation at his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. We believe that his skill  experience  dedication and wisdom will ensure the successful conclusion of this session.May I also take this opportunity to extend my hear felt appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  for the able leadership he provided to the General Assembly at its fortieth session.I should like to express our happiness at seeing the Secretary-General  His Excellency Javier Ptfrez de Cuellar  back at the helm of this Organization  which he has so ably led for the past five years. His invaluable service to the Organization and his determined efforts in the interest of international peace and security as well as his vision and realism  as demonstrated particularly in his recent report on the work of the Organization  have earned him the respect and admiration of the international community.The current session of the General Assembly is taking place in rather unusual circumstances and in a less comforting international climate. We say it is unusual because in the last four decades there have been very few sessions of the General Assembly at which the United Nations has taken such an inward look with a view to overcoming the political challenges and the resulting financial crises facing it. He say it is less comforting because the world is still beset by a host of political  economic and social problems that have defied solution for a long time now.If this session of the General Assembly is to be one of introspection  then let us all be clear about the causes of the problems afflicting our Organization. The United Nations has been accused of being administratively inefficient and financially wasteful. While acknowledging the fact that there is still more that could be done in order to streamline the administration and economize on its finances  we have to be clear as to what kind of crisis the Organization is facing.The Ethiopian delegation is convinced that the crisis is not financial; we believe it is essentially political  as was stated by our Secretary-General in his latest report on the work of the United Nations. Indeed  it is a political crisis caused by lingering sentiments and outmoded perceptions inimical to the democratization of international relations  to the recognition of  and respect for  the sovereign equality of nations and to a constructive accommodation of inevitable changes in international relations. These obviously arise from apprehensions in some circles that the multilateral approach to problems and acceptance of changing situations will rob them of their positions of power and unfair privileges. These circles promote and rationalize their perceptions under the convenient guise of protecting the United Nations from ""the irresponsible diktat of a mechanical majority"".Such an attitude  I submit  represents a threat to the sovereignty and the national interests of the developing countries  furthermore  it represents an erosion of faith in the cardinal principles enunciated in the Charter and a negation of the inexorable historical tide of change which  in the last forty years has altered not only the system of international relations  but also the united Nations itself.Let us therefore resolve here and now to repel this dangerous onslaught against the United Nations in particular and against multilateralism in general. As a first step  we call upon all States to fulfill the obligations they have assumed under the Charter as regards the full and prompt payment of the assessed contributions to the budget of the Organization.Today  not only are we endeavoring to protect the integrity and enhance the effectiveness of the united Nations  but we are indeed  through the instrumentality of this Organization  engaged in a determined search for solutions to the numerous problems of today's world. One such problem that calls for urgent and effective action is the situation in southern Africa.The United Nations plan for Namibia's independence  to which the South African regime had initially given its agreement and the sponsors of which are the major Western Powers  remains unimplemented - eight long years after its adoption. Much as the Pretoria regime had never seriously entertained the idea of leaving Namibia  it would be foolhardy to expect that regime to evict itself from Namibia when the most powerful nations in the West give it the assurance  loud and clear  that its refusal to implement the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) entails no retaliatory enforcement measures.Ethiopia  even at this stage  believes that the United Nations plan is the only internationally acceptable plan for the peaceful transition of Namibia to genuine independence. It equally believes that unless and until global  comprehensive and mandatory sanctions are imposed against South Africa  that country's regime will have very few  If any  compelling reasons to heed the will of the international community. Those that oppose this peaceful course of action must eventually bear the responsibility for the death  destruction and suffering the inevitable intensification of the armed struggle in Namibia would involve.What I have said about their responsibility also holds true with regard to the situation within South Africa itself. As was clearly stated by the World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  held last June in Paris  global  comprehensive and mandatory sanctions offer the only peaceful path for the elimination of the evil system of apartheid. In this regard  we are encouraged by events unfolding all over the world and in particular the Western world. While taking note of the measures taken by some Western Governments further to isolate the Pretoria regime  we cannot but state our conviction that more forceful and meaningful measures must be taken. The conclusions of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group and the complete failure of the ill-fated mission of the British Foreign Secretary to South Africa have deprived those opposed to sanctions of all pretexts for their self-serving position and delaying tactics.At the same time as it imposes sanctions  the international community is also duty-bound to assist and protect the front-line States  which have contributed more than their share  perhaps  to the liberation struggle in southern Africa.For our part  we say that apartheid must be dismantled  not reformed  and on its ruins must be established a free and multiracial South Africa  for whose birth its heroic sons and daughters sacrifice themselves daily with the utmost courageand determination. For their cause  for their struggle and for the noble objectives of freedom and equality  the support and commitment of the people and Government of socialist Ethiopia will continue to grow stronger until freedom for all South Africans and independence for all Namibians  as well as peace and security for the front-line States  become a reality.Turning to the situation in the Middle East  we witness another problem: a continuing appalling human tragedy and the endless suffering of the Palestinian people. In our view  the complex nature of the problem demands a comprehensive approach within the framework of an international peace conference  with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).Further  we believe that the attainment of a just and lasting peace in the region depends on the restoration of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to establish a Palestinian State  the return of Israel to its pre-1967 borders and respect for the right of all the States of the region to live in peace within recognized boundaries.Another matter of serious concern is the grave situation currently obtaining in Central America. At the heart of the problem lies the policy of intervention  which is manifested by support for counter-revolutionary elements against the Sandinista revolution and the national sovereignty of the people of Nicaragua. While deploring the refusal of the United States to abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice  we reaffirm our support for and solidarity with the heroic people of Nicaragua.We also offer our solidarity to the people of Cyprus and Lebanon  whose sovereignty and territorial integrity are under constant threat. As regards the problem of Cyprus in particular  socialist Ethiopia believes that the convening ofan international conference could provide a viable forum in the search for a lasting solution based on respect for the unity  territorial integrity  independence and non-aligned status of Cyprus  as stipulated in the relevant United Nations resolutions.Ethiopia also believes that the international community should support the efforts to bring about the peaceful reunification of the Korean people  for the purpose of which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has advanced constructive and useful proposals.In addition to these problem areas  I cannot but refer to the Iran-Iraq war and the situations regarding Western Sahara  Kampuchea and Afghanistan  inasmuch as the position of my Government on all these issues has already been expressed from this very rostrum  I shall refrain from stating it once again. Nevertheless  as a hinterland State of the Indian Ocean  my country's concern at the current situation in and around the Indian Ocean must be reiterated  and in this regard we should like to underline the imperative need to convene the International Conference on the Indian Ocean before 1988  as decided upon at the fortieth session of the General Assembly.As regards the situation in the Horn of Africa  Ethiopia believes that only through scrupulous adherence to the fundamental principles of respect for the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  the inviolability of their boundaries and non-interference in their internal affairs can mutual trust and confidence be created and a lasting peace established in the region.Despite externally inspired  externally organized  externally equipped and armed and externally directed acts of aggression and provocation against the historical unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ethiopia  my Government has for a long time adhered to  and will in the future continue to respect  thesebasic principles of inter-State relations. I should like to take this opportunity to call upon all those concerned to do likewise and join Ethiopia in a guest for genuine peace and development for the peoples of the subregion.Every year at the General Assembly and in different international and regional forums we talk of peace. In public or in private  today peace has become.a household word and increasing concern is expressed about it. Indeed  the last session of the General Assembly designated 1986 International Year of Peace. All these  of course  are expressions of the best intent  manifesting an endless guest for peace.Yet  in present circumstances and at this point in world history one can hardly speak of real peace  for the ever increasing arms race is threatening the very survival of humanity and its civilization. The last 40 years have witnessed the production and deployment of new nuclear-weapon systems with more deadly destructive power and capable of destroying the world many times over. Moreover  we now witness new attempts to extend the frontiers of the arms race into outer space. Ethiopia strongly believes that the security of nations is to be found not in nuclear armament but in general and complete disarmament.We have  therefore  to focus attention on two priority areas  one of which is the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. The renunciation of the threat and use of nuclear weapons through a convention would contribute to removing anxiety  fear and suspicion from the tense world situation and to restoring mutual confidence  trust and understanding.The other priority issue is the immediate conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  which we are convinced will also go a long way to putting a brake on the spiraling arms race. My delegation pays a deserved tribute to the Government of the Soviet Union for the very positive commitments it has made and the measures it has taken in that regard. World peace and human progress demand that a halt be put to all underground nuclear tests and to the dangerous and costly Star Wars Program. In that connection  we commend the six-nation five-continent group for its constructive and timely proposals in the field of arms control and disarmament.Nuclear security is but a mirage that recedes with each step taken in the futile search for it. Furthermore  the world can ill afford to sustain the arms race  at a staggering cost of $900 billion a year  while hundreds of millions of people live on the margins of human existence. This fact  of course  underlines the interrelationship between disarmament and development - an issue whose importance cannot be over-emphasized and for whose discussion the proposed international conference must be held without any further delay.Unless and until the process of genuine disarmament commences  which should bei soon  and vital resources are released for the purposes of development  the deplorable economic and social conditions of much of humanity will of themselves pose a grave threat to world peace  no less than that posed by nuclear weapons. It is to be regretted  however  that that grim prospect is not given the urgent attention it deserves by some circles in the developed world. While it is truethat  in the final analysis  development depends on the efforts of each individual country  it is equally true that it requires a favorable climate of adequate financial and technical assistance  as well as an effective system of international co-operation. That fact can easily be seen with reference to the critical economic situation in Africa.Africa inherited from its colonial past an economy marked by structural imbalances. Over the years  the situation has been aggravated by the world economic environment  which is characterized by a decline in the flow of external resources and sharply declining prices of primary commodities  with a consequent reduction of export earnings. The accumulation of external debt  with onerous debt service payments  and recurrent drought and creeping desertification have all become severe impediments to Africa's developmental efforts*The structural imbalances  pervasive low level of productivity and aggravating external factors have interacted for so long as to place Africa in such a weakened position that the dramatic effects of the recent drought are but a manifestation of the fragile nature of the underlying socio-economic structure. The drought merely accentuated Africa's more pervasive structural problems.While we in Africa appreciate the very positive response of the international community during the critical emergency years between 1982 and 1985  a lasting solution to the problem of Africa calls for the international community's commitment to assist the continent beyond the emergency phase* We believe that it was this realization that led to the convening of the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly  which  one must admit  helped further to sensitize the world community to the grave situation prevailing in Africa. What remains to be done is to implement the measures called for in the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. In addition to the African economic situation  the debt crisis is another example of a problem that cries out for international co-operation and assistance. The rapidly escalating debt burden of Africa and the debt-servicing obligations  for instance  have imposed major debilitating effects on the African economies. In all respects  Africa's debt burden  which more than doubled between 1974 and 19B4 and accounts for almost half its gross domestic product  is heavier and more onerous than that of other debtor regions. Unless bold and imaginative measures are also taken in this regard  the economies of both the debtor and creditor countries will be gravely affected.At the global level  too  the need for international co-operation for development can hardly be over-emphasized. Much as stagnation in the industrialized countries negatively affects development in the South  growth in the developing world will definitely have a positive impact on employment and the export trade in the North. So development assistance  in short  should be viewed as mutually beneficial to both the donor and the recipient countries. Unfortunately  the current international economic system  characterized as it is by inequity and injustice  cannot possibly afford us the opportunities for development. It is little wonder  therefore  that we should still persevere in our efforts to establish the new international economic order and  to that end  to call for renewed efforts to reactivate the process of global negotiations.Developed countries must recognize that problems of development are the problems not of the poor alone  but of the rich as well. As failure to realize that fact would be disastrous to all  co-operation between North and South must be revitalized and the major imbalances in the world economy  including the related issues of money  finance  trade and development  must be immediately attended to. Finally  let me stress once again that the current international situation leaves much to be desired. Not only is peace threatened  but avenues for development are increasingly blocked. The very future of the United Nations itseLf is by no means certain. To save the United Nations - indeed  the world - from impending danger  we have to come up with new initiatives to solve old problems and with novel approaches to cope with new challenges. While we must all be realistic in facing up to the present challenges of peace and development  our realism should not be based on expediency  opportunism or despair; ours must be a realism motivated by ideals. Ethiopia takes this opportunity to reaffirm once again its readiness to make the necessary contribution to the noble quest for peace  progress and justice  and  as a victim of the breakdown of international morality and legality in the 1930s  reiterates its unshakable faith  confidence and trust in our united Nations."
"48",2322,"FIN",41,1986,"May I first congratulate our President on his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. He brings to his high office unique knowledge and expertise based on service in various capacities. Bangladesh is highly appreciated for its long-standing contribution in the work related particularly to the development process of the least developed countries. I am convinced that he will lead this session to a successful and fruitful conclusion.I should also like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to Ambassador de Pinies  who served with great distinction as President of the General Assembly during its fortieth session. Like those who have spoken before me  I wish to express my admiration for the way in which Mr. de Pinies carried out his task.The determined efforts and capable leadership of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in the face of the harsh international situation described in his report  have the full support of the Finnish Government.When speaking from this rostrum in recent years I have seen only little reason for optimism. Despite signs of improvement  that assessment is still valid. Particularly the increased violence  of which we receive new reports daily  givescause for alarm. I fear that unless governments which have given their pledge to the Charter work effectively together/ our noble intentions collapse  confrontation prevails over co-operation and violence replaces negotiation.Yet there are signs of promise. During the past year we have witnessed an encouraging improvement in the atmosphere of East-West relations. The ongoing negotiations in Geneva  both bilateral and multilateral  give cause for hope. In the economic field we have also experienced new positive developments which  it is hoped  will lead to the revitalizing of negotiations on international economic co-operation and development.My Government has welcomed with great satisfaction the reactivation of the dialog between the two leading Powers. We particularly welcomed the fact that at their first meeting the leaders of the Soviet Onion and the United States  conscious of their special responsibility for maintaining peace  agreed that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. In a common pledge both leaders stated that they will not seek to achieve military superiority. We hope that these principles will provide a solid basis for a continued dialog resulting in concrete agreements. They have already given new stimulus for a dialog across a broad range of issues  particularly in the domain of disarmament. We hope that meetings at all levels  including the highest level  will remain a regular practice in relations between the leading Powers.In addition to the bilateral negotiations between the two leading Powers  the Conference on Disarmament  with its broad agenda  offers an important multilateral negotiating forum. The banning of chemical weapons  prevention of nuclear war  limitation of nuclear arsenals  and prevention of the arms race  including its extension to new areas  in particular to outer space  remain priorities on the agenda of multilateral disarmament negotiations. Particularly an agreement on acomprehensive test ban would be an important disarmament measure. We appeal for such an agreement and we give our support to all measures  including a moratorium on tests  wMch could lead to such an agreement.In Europe  considerable progress has been made in the framework of the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). A lot has been done and the past CSCE expert meetings and conferences in all three important areas of the Final Act - in security questions  in economic relations and in the humanitarian area - give substantial ground for further co-operation. The outcome of the Stockholm Conference opa>s widening possibilities for increasing mutual confidence among the European nations and thus provides enhanced stability and security in our continent. It also testifies to the continuing commitment of the 35 participating States to the implementation of the provisions of the Final Act. The Vienna follow-up meeting of the CSCE will offer a renewed opportunity to review what has been accomplished and to chart the future course of the CSCE process.Another positive development in recent international co-operation is the successful included special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa last May. The African Governments have shown determination in reviewing their domestic policies and in adjusting their economies to the hard internal and external realities of today's economic environment. The international community endorsed this new orientation by adopting unanimously the African Priority Program for Economic Recovery (APPER). Its full implementation is now an obligation for the international community. For its part Finland has already started to incorporate the APPER program into Finnish development co-operation with Africa. It is important  in our view  that the donor governments also bear in mind the financial needs of the APPER program when decisions on replenishment levels are made in various international financial institutions.The objectives of the APPER program also serve to illustrate the interdependence of different aspects of economic development. The program strengthens  in practical terms  the understanding of the interrelationship between the environment  the use of natural resources and population growth.Awareness on these issues is spreading. In this respect concrete policy measures are being outlined in APPER. They can and should also be applied in other parts of the developing world. And they should be supported and complemented by external resources from industrialized countries. This is highly important especially now  when the implementation of such complex developmental programs requiring difficult measures of economic adjustment is being carried out.In the area of international economic co-operation there are fewer and fewer issues which lend themselves to unilateral action. The open multilateral trading system is of crucial importance to the economic development of all countries and particularly the developing countries. In the view of my Government the decision reached at Punta del Este to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations was of essential importance. It will undoubtedly be conducive to an improved international climate of trade policy. Finland looks towards the negotiations ahead with confidence and expects that the new round will lead to further trade liberalization  to the strengthening of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) system and to a better response in the face of the evolving international economic cooperation and international relations in general.The positive developments in the international economic co-operation which I have just mentioned should form a basis for further progress on pending important international economic issues such as those in the interrelated areas of money  finance  debt and trade. In this connection the role of the United Nations in the economic field should be clarified. Also  the idea of convening a ministerial session of the Economic and Social Council deserves attention.I have spoken about positive signs in the broad area of international relations. They do not change the overall picture  in which human suffering and the use of force are dominant features. The Finnish Government strongly rejects the use of force in international relations in any form whatsoever. This applies to acts by States as well as individuals. Human rights and fundamental freedoms continue to be denied in many parts of the world. It is our common responsibilityto ensure respect for them.Today we are witnessing new forms of international violence  notably terrorism. Front pages of the press repeatedly contain descriptions of attacks by terrorist groups claiming to further a multitude of causes. Terrorist acts against innocent people deserve the strongest condemnation.Effective international action is needed to prevent terrorism. Last year theGeneral Assembly condemned""as criminal  all acts  methods and practices of terrorism  wherever and by whomever committed  including those which jeopardize friendly relations among States and their security""  (resolution 40/61  para. 1) Last December the Security Council unequivocally condemned all acts of hostage-taking and abduction  having already agreed on a common statement on international terrorism in which it condemned ""terrorism in all its forms"". The international community ought to develop new  modern means of controlling jointly the new forms of violence. And equally jointly we must find ways to eradicate gradually what lies behind the violence. In the long run that would be much more effective than merely trying to control violent outbursts resulting from those rootcauses.I cannot fail to take note of the wide-ranging political confrontation and open warfare which haunt parts of Africa and Asia as well as Central America and the Middle East. We shall have an opportunity to discuss these burning issues as this session of the Assembly continues its work. In this statement I should like  however  to deal with two issues: southern Africa and the Middle East. Thecrises in these regions have grown even more critical and increasingly challenge the world community.The situation in southern Africa has been the subject of a number of significant international meetings during the recent months. In South Africa the vast majority of the people are determined to end the inhuman apartheid system and the repression practised by the racist regime. The need for concerted international action to persuade the South African Government to abandon the system of apartheid has become evident. Finland  together with the other Nordic countries  is working to increase economic and other pressure against South Africa. We expect the Security Council to take an early decision to impose effective sanctions against South Africa. The world community has a responsibility to alleviate any economic hardships South Africa is causing its neighbors. We appeal to all countries to increase their economic and humanitarian assistance to the front-line States and co-operation with the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference.The fourteenth special session of the General Assembly on Namibia  which was held last week and at which I presented the Finnish position  amply and accurately demonstrated that the international community does not condone any pretexts to delay Namibian independence on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).The situation in the Middle East remains grave. There is again a risk of a recurrence of more widespread violations. During recent months we have witnessed a number of tragic incidents which have resulted in many victims.Just and lasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved only if Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  together with guarantees of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  form the basis of the settlement. The possibility of convening an international conference for the purpose of reaching acomprehensive settlement of the conflict  with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestinians and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  should be thoroughly examined.The United Nations and its peace-keeping operations play a vital role in creating favorable conditions for a political solution. These operations have proved a useful instrument of crisis management. During the current year the United Nations peace-keeping Force in Lebanon has carried out its duties under constant and growing danger. It operates in a deteriorating situation created by the inability of the parties involved to reach agreement on security arrangements in the area and to come to an understanding of the role of the Force in southern Lebanon. However unsatisfactory the present state of affairs may be  Finland continues to believe in the role of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We are grateful to the Secretary-General and his staff for their unrelenting efforts to redress the situation.The Charter provides an international code of conduct which binds all Member States. The first and foremost task of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security. To fulfill its task this Organization should shoulder its responsibility for collective security as defined in the Charter and make every effort to develop a more just  secure and stable system of different but equal and interdependent nations. The United Nations should assist in resolving conflicts and disputes between nations; it should foster economic and social progress and promote human rights.Times have changed  and the challenges facing the Organization have expanded tremendously. One of the most serious new challenges for the world community is the protection of our common environment. Environmental protection has become more and more a problem of international dimensions. As for my own country  Finland has been active in its own region to promote environmental protection. Examples of the results already achieved are the Convention on Trans-boundary Air Pollution  negotiated under the auspices of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECC)  and the Convention on the Protection of the Baltic Sea. During the follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  to be held soon in Vienna  Finland will make a proposal to convene an expert meeting on the environment.Yet regional co-operation  as important as it is  does not alone meet our needs. The endeavors of the rapidly growing world population to achieve higher and higher levels of material consumption is burdening the global environment more and more with results which  in the worst analysis  might lead to a catastrophe. Mankind has to take this threat seriously. The United Nations should provide us with the practical means to promote international co-operation in this area of primary and vital importance.Together with the other Nordic countries  Finland is systematically examining ways and means of strengthening the Organization. In these efforts  the reports submitted by the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization offer us valuable guidelines. Ours is an Organization of sovereign States  each with  its own legitimate need for security and well-being. Yet it is also an Organization of common responsibility. The United Nations is as strong or as weak as we  the Member States  want it to be.Against the background of our common aspirations and common achievements  the present financial and administrative crisis of the United Nations seems paradoxical. The latest development gives us a reason for serious concern about the Organization's ability to carry out its task. As we know  the financial viability of the United Nations is jeopardized at the moment. A situation like this is most regrettable and cannot be condoned. The financial crisis of the United Nations is detrimental to the Organization's authority and is even an actagainst the Charter.We have to make all efforts to restore the credibility and financial viability of the United Nations. The prerequisite for the reassessment of the financial situation is that all countries pay their past and current dues in accordance with the Charter  in full and without delay.Furthermore  we have to address the question relating to the efficiency of the Organization. During the coming weeks the Assembly will examine the recommendations of the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts. The study conducted by the Group has been called by necessity. It provides  in our opinion  a useful basis for further discussion on longer-term remedial measures in order to promote the efficiency of the United Nations.In my intervention I have emphasized the unique role of the United Nations based upon the Charter. Finland wholeheartedly supports the Secretary-General as he states in his report that the United Nations should become that strong constructive force in world affairs that is vitally needed. The complex problems of an increasingly interdependent world can only be solved with the help of effective multilateral action. This is the role the United Nations should attain and preserve."
"49",2366,"FJI",41,1986," Sir  my delegation joins others in warmly congratulating you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-first session. We also compliment your predecessor  Mr. de Pinies of Spain  on his distinguished leader ship of the fortieth session.The year 1986 has been designated the International Year of Peace. We sincerely hope that the eloquent rhetoric and lofty sentiments so character is tic of recent debates will be translated into genuine and meaningful action. The privileged position of the permanent members of the Security Council imposes on them the primary responsibility for setting the example  In {articular  on the two super-Powers rest the heaviest obligations to the world community. Therefore we greatly welcome the summit meeting of the two leaders due in a few days' time.In the quest for peace and a world free of nuclear weapons  interlocking nuclear-free zones can play a prominent role. To the end the 13 independent countries comprising the South Pacific Forum at their 16th meeting in Rarotonga in July last year adopted the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty.So far ten members of the Forum have signed the treaty  aid four have ratified it. He expect the treaty to cone into force before the end of this year. The treaty will make a tangible contribution to disarmament efforts  to arms control and to the promotion of international peace and security.At the 17th South Pacific Forum meeting  held last month in Suva  Fiji  the members expressed the strong hope that the nuclear-weapon States would acknowledge the concerns and aspirations of the peoples of the region by sickling the Protocols when they were opened to signature. In this regard  the Forum expressed pleasure that some States eligible to sign the Protocols had already indicated that signature would receive prompt and favorable consideration.While the nations of the South Pacific are attempting to ensure that their region remains nuclear-free  we are deeply concerned that  in the face of our long-standing  strong and unanimous opposition  the Government of France defiantly continues its nuclear testing program at Mururoa. How much longer can a country that professes to be a world leader in its respect for international law and obligations continue to act so arrogantly? If  as France maintains  nuclear testing is so vital to the security interests of the Western alliance  perhaps the United States might consider allowing France to use the Nevada test site. On the other hand  if the tests are as safe as claimed  then there is good reason to move testing to its Mediterranean island of Corsica or to mainland France itself.The process of decolonization and the self-determination of dependent peoples has yet to be completed in our region  the South Pacific. At their Suva meeting last month  the 13 independent South Pacific Forum countries reaffirmed""support for the peaceful transition to an independent New Caledonia in accordance with the innate  active rights and aspirations of the indigenous people and in a manner which guarantees the rights and interests of all inhabitants of this multiracial society"". The Forum members agreed to seek the re-inscription of New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. The Harare summit conference of non-aligned countries fully endorsed this call and urged the General Assembly at the forty-first session to act accordingly. X renew that plea and sincerely hope that the joint efforts of the South Pacific Forum Members of the United Nations will receive unanimous support when the matter is brought before the Assembly.In the same spirit  the South Pacific Forum noted that the peoples of the Federated States of Micronesia  the Mar shall Islands. Palau and the Northern Marianas have already exercised their right to self-determination  some of them many years ago. They have requested the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement. Forum members respect their wishes and urge prompt termination of the Trusteeship Agreement over Mi crones ia  in accordance with the Trusteeship Council resolution of 28 May.As our contribution towards maintaining peace and towards achieving an acceptable and lasting solution in the Middle East  Fiji has provided troops for the United Nations peace-keeping operations in Lebanon since 1978. My Government welcomes the decision of States which had formerly withheld payment to begin now paying their assessed contributions to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon but urges them to make good their arrears. We also urge all countries to pay fully and promptly their assessed contributions  as defaulting by any State  and especially by major States  results in a most unfair burden on troop-contributingcountries and particularly on the smaller developing countries. It is to us painfully ironic that  while many large and wealthy nations  for whatever reason  owe the Organization vast sums  the troop-contributing countries are owed more than 3250 million. For my small country  a debt of 318 million is no light burden.We believe that the report of the Group of High-Lev el Intergovernmental Experts on the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations is a valuable basis foe improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Organization. We particularly support the recommendations which aim at streamlining the institutions and structures within the United Nations system. We fully endorse the call for rationalizing the roles and functions of over lapping agencies. In the final analysis  however  it is the political will of Fomenter States which will determine whether the present financial crisis is resolved and the Organization put on a firmer footing.My Government is deeply distressed at the tragic events unfolding in South Africa. We sincerely hope that good sense may yet prevail and the escalating violence brought to an end. We sure in full accord with the measures agreed cm by the Commonwealth and urge the still-reluctant countries to join this initiative.South Africa's continued illegal occupation of Namibia and its persistent defiance of the United Nations plan and Security Council resolution 435 (1978) cannot be tolerated much longer. The international community and the people of Namibia cannot be forced into impotence by the unwillingness of the few to take effective action.We strongly deplore the aggressive actions of States which threaten to undermine the sovereignty and integrity of other nations. Along with many others  my Government's deep concern about the situation in Kampuchea remains unchanged. We endorse again the call for a comprehensive political solution which would secure the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces and enable the Kampuchean people to determine their own destiny through free and fair elections. We believe the eight-point proposal put forward by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea contains all the necessary elements for a just solution.We also reaffirm our Government's support for the widespread call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and the restoration of the genuine independence and sovereignty of the Afghan people.My Government also welcomes the recent resumption of contact between North and South Korea. We fully support the admission of the two Koreas to this Organization  pending their reunification.It is tragic that a solution to the Palestinian problem remains so elusive. Any just and durable settlement must  in our view  incorporate the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland as well as the right to existence and security of all States in the region  including Israel.My Government also fully supports the territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty of Cyprus. In our view  the mission of good offices under the auspices of the Secretary-General appears to offer the best hope for a viable solution to the Cyprus problem.My Government also strongly applauds the Secretary-General and his staff for their strenuous and untiring efforts at mediation in the many trouble-spots around the world. Progress is not easy  but we exhort them not to waver in their valuable peace-keeping role.The problem of drug abuse is one of the most serious of the modern world; afflicting nations large and small  rich and poor. The international community must act speedily and decisively  and in total accord  to eradicate this scourge. We strongly support the holding of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking and hope that firm and effective co-operative international action will result.International terrorism is manifesting itself in more and more horrifying forms. We condemn all acts of systematic violence to achieve political ends  which result in the maiming and killing of innocent people. Greater co-operation among nations must be fostered to stamp it out. At the same time the underlying causes must be urgently addressed.Ever burdening foreign debt  increasing protectionism and depressed commodity prices continue to plague the economies of much of the developing world. while some attention is given bo these problems in the larger regions  the smaller countries  and particularly the small island countries  tend to be overlooked. Most of the smaller Pacific Island States are seriously lacking in natural resources. For all of us the sea represents a vital asset  much of which  because of a lade of technology  expertise and capital  we are unable to exploit adequately. We seek a fair and equitable deal to enable us to tap these resources and thereby acquire the means to give our peoples a better standard of living. To this end  we people of the Pacific believe strongly in self help  but all our efforts will be nullified unless we are given reasonable trading access to developed markets.My delegation assures you  Mr. President  of our full co-operation during your tenure of office  we are hopeful that history will judge the forty-first session of the General Assembly to have been one of the most productive  and as one that achieved far-reaching solutions to the more urgent problems besetting the world and our Organization. "
"50",2413,"FRA",41,1986,"It is a great honor for me to address the Assembly on behalf oFrance.The French Government is pleased  Sir  that the General Assembly is meeting this year under your distinguished guidance. Your election is a tribute to Bangladesh  whose commitment to peace and international co-operation is known to all of us here. It also bears witness to the confidence our delegations have in you  sure in the knowledge that you will carry out your mandate with the authority necessary to direct our work successfully. You can count on the whole-hearted co-operation of the French delegation  which offers you its warmest congratulations and its best wishes for success.It is also a pleasure for me to salute our Secretary-General  whom I was delighted to receive in Paris a short time ago. I am happy to see him restored to health  and to be able to express again  here  the French Government's gratitude for the services he has rendered our Organization  and in particular for the decisive contribution he made to settling the dispute that had arisen between New Zealand and France. I hope he will obtain from all Member States the assurances he has every right to seek in order to continue the mission entrusted to him nearly five years ago  which he has carried out with such competence and skill. The fortieth anniversary of our Organization  while an occasion for celebrating our achievements  also reminded us of the limitations reality imposes on the implementation of the Charter.	^To review the disillusionments and disappointments is in itself a salutary exercise. Today  as the Secretary-General emphasized in his remarkable report  our Organization faces not only the problem of its financial situation  but also the inability of its Members to agree on priorities and tasks. It is my feeling  however  that the general realization of past disarray and inadequacies has  foe the first time  led to a commitment to real reform  as evidenced by the conclusions of the Group of 18.No one disputes the existing shortcomings in co-operation between Members of the United Nations  but this necessary clear-sightedness should not lead us to take a pessimistic view. On the contrary  France considers that only a display of demonstrating realism can give us assurance that we shall be able to resolve the problems of today and those of the future.The San Francisco Charter made the preservation of international peace and security the primary goal of the United Nations. Looked at uncompromisingly and without ideological bias  the world in which we live is seen to fall far short of the expectations of the founders of the United Nations.One of the outstanding features of our age  accentuated by changes in attitudes and by technological progress  is the shrinking of our planet  which is leading to increasing overlapping of problems at the world level. No serious event  however localized  can leave us indifferent any more. Today neither conflicts nor alliances take account of frontiers or distances. They transcend differences of culture and race  without  however  eliminating them. Cn the contrary  in many cases  the internationalization of problems has triggered a backlash  sometimes very extreme  in the form of clannish behavior of every kind.Paradoxically  therefore  while the world is tending to become a single entity  it has not been able to overcome th.; threats and collective challenges confronting it. Conflicts and violations of human rights are increasing  while the cancer of terrorism is spreading. The arms race is continuing  spurred on by technological progress  the benefits of which ought rather to be shared throughout the world. The economic and financial situation of many third world countries remains very critical.In the Middle East  France has long maintained that peace must be based on principles which  for us  are self-evident. Israel's security and right to existence must be acknowledged and guaranteed; the Palestinian people must be permitted to exercise its right to self-determination. Peace presupposes first of all mutual recognition by the parties concerned and the primary responsibility of the parties in the quest for a settlement  which cannot be achieved by outside Powers  although their contribution may be very useful.That being so  there is now talk again of convening a properly prepared conference with the presence of all the parties concerned. He approve of this in principle and are ready to play a full part in helping to find a solution to a conflict that is too serious for the international community to have the right to regard itself as powerless.Among the favorable signs that may be noted is that the idea of the need for dialog is gaining ground  albeit slowly. France has always welcomed indications to that effect.Unfortunately  these rays of hope do not allow us to forget the unending crisis that is tearing Lebanon apart. It has tragic consequences for a people linked to France by age-old ties of every kind  a people France loves and respects.Whatever else may have been said  Lebanon was once a very model of coexistence  tolerance  freedom and culture to the entire world. It would be an irreparable loss if this center of intellectual vitality  whose light shone throughout the Mediterranean world  were to be engulfed in the rising tide of fanaticism and hatred. It is my fervent hope that this battered and ravaged country will one day find the path to reconciliation through the restoration of its independence and territorial integrity.For the past several years  by virtue of its historical ties with Lebanon -but also because the issue far transcends Lebanon itself - France has madeceaseless efforts  at the price of considerable sacrifice  to promote the return to peace longed for by the vast majority of Lebanese. To that end  France decided to participate in international action wh<ch made it possible to limit the chaos in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion. Our Ambassador in Beirut  Louis Delamare  was among the first to pay with his life for his untiring efforts to renew dialog between fraternal enemies. Dozens of French soldiers have been killed in the attempt to permit a return to the rule of law and to restore a minimum of normal life to the civilian population of Beirut.In the south of that suffering country the international community is endeavoring to prevent a new escalation in the fighting and senseless violence. Side by side with other national contingents in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  French soldiers have all too often paid with their lives in a peace mission.But of late the situation has become intolerable. The united Nations Force is no longer merely being caught in sporadic clashes between the enemies it is meant to be keeping apart; it has become the target of methodically prepared attacks which will soon leave it no alternative other than to retrench in order to ensure its own safety.We must note that since its formation in 1978 UNIFIL has been unable to carry out the mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council. That is why last April France drew the attention of the Council to this state of affairs and to the concern it was causing us. The events of the past few weeks have  unfortunately  confirmed our assessment. The sacrifices we have accepted to date give us the right to demand that each of us should shoulder his responsibilities and that the means available to the Force should be commensurate with the mission entrusted to it. We are facing a serious challenge to our Organization  its authority and its ability to carry out peace-keeping operations. That challenge must be met.For sore than six years Iraq and Iran have been tearing each other apart in a war which  because of its intensity and the resources and tremendous losses it has entailed  can no longer be considered simply as a regional conflict. Freedom of navigation has been imperiled on shipping routes of vital importance for the world economy. The dogged prosecution of this absurd war threatens to shatter the equilibrium of a region of strategic importance. Like all other members of the international community  France is aware of and deeply concerned by this situation. We can but express our hope for a reasonable negotiated outcome to this protracted conflict  and we urge that the relevant Security Council resolutions finally be implemented. France supports all efforts to bring an end to this war  in particular the Secretary-General's offers of mediation.Although We have dwelt at length on crises in the Middle East that our Organization has thus far  unfortunately  been powerless to resolve  I have no intention of forgetting all the others which have thwarted the peace efforts of our Organization for many years. These include: Cyprus  where a de facto situation which France does not recognize has been established; Afghanistan and Cambodia  subjects to which I shall return in this statement; the Korean peninsula  where division and tension have persisted for 40 years and where it is our earnest hope to see dialog established between North and South  which is the only way to ease tension and then to resolve the Korean question. We wish the United Nations to be a truly universal body and  hence  for all the Korean people to be represented here. Other crises include the situation in Central America  where I hope that with the active assistance of all the countries in the region a solution nay be found to the current crisis; and Western Sahara  where I hope that the joint efforts of the Secretary-General and of the past and current Chairmen of the Organization of African Unity will make it possible to resolve a conflict involving States friendly to France  a conflict which has already lasted too long.The international community cannot fail to express its indignation at the continuing daily violations of the most basic human rights throughout the world  whether such violations result from the wars raging in several areas or from deliberate policies. No pressure  regardless of its source  and no sophism can ever make us accept such violations. Transcending all ideologies and arguments prompted by expediency  there can be only one concept of human dignity.I am pleased to see that in many States  especially the Philippines and Latin America  the return to democracy has shown that people have never forgotten it.For several years now  with the courage born of determination to defend their independence and dignity  the Afghan and Cambodian peoples have been resisting foreign occupation and the authorities it has imposed on them.In Afghanistan one third of the inhabitants of the country have had to seek refuge outside its borders. The elite of the population has had to leave the country in large numbers  and every day women  children and old people have been paying the price of the acts of war perpetrated against their villages in violation of all humanitarian principles.In Cambodia the Khmer people  a friend of France  is the victim of increasingly oppressive foreign occupation. We are even witnessing a new form of colonization in that country.Were the Afghan and Cambodian peoples to be given back their pride and freedom they would not constitute a threat to anyone in the region any mere than they  have in the past  and certainly not to their powerful neighbors. The invasions of which they are victims must be seen as wars of conquest belonging to another age  and France will continue to say  along with the vast majority of States  that the Soviet Union and Viet Nam must  in their own interest and for the sake of world peace  end their respective ventures in Afghanistan and Cambodia.Speaking on behalf of the Twelve  Britain's Foreign Secretary has just stated once again that the institutionalized racial discrimination that the South African authorities persist in maintaining is unacceptable. The measures announced by Pretoria have so far not touched on essentials  and no one should be surprised that they have failed to check the spiral of violence.While recognizing the complexity of the problems involved  France  together with its partners in the European Community  has decided to put into effect an additional program of sanctions but believes that these arrangements should be supplemented by positive measures. Everything possible must be done to promote genuine dialog  which of course presupposes the freeing of political prisoners.Together with all those who are working to encourage moderation and conciliation in that country  we should like to believe that it is not too late to lay the foundations of a society in which  without exception  the right to dignity of all the communities that have built South Africa is at last recognized.The tragic events in Istanbul  Karachi and Paris have proved once again that terrorism has become the systematic weapon of a war that knows no frontiers and is mostly faceless.Admittedly the phenomenon is not a new one and instances of it are only too numerous. However  I am struck by the recent upsurge of terrorism and the growing number of victims. Here I must mention in particular the French  American and British hostages being held in Lebanon.Unless it wants to delude itself  the international community should recognize that it has not always faced up to the scourge as unflinchingly as it should have. Some would have us believe that it is the only means of expression of oppressed peoples. The odious methods it uses  the slaughter of innocent people in free societies and the continuing blackmail over the lives of hostages make it impossible for us to confuse  even for a moment  those actions with genuine resistance.Certainly no one would deny that the persistence of unresolved conflicts and the injustices they bring in their train is one of the sources of terrorism. But we must also denounce many other causes such as the rising tide of intolerance and fanaticism and the complicity of States that are willing to close their eyes to the activities of terrorist organizations or do not hesitate to use them to their own advantage and even go so far as to encourage them.In a world in which indiscriminate terrorist violence can affect the citizens of all States  there was bound to be a reaction.We are gratified to note that the General Assembly  reflecting that world-wide realization  last year condemned these cowardly and criminal practices and that the Security Council and the Commission on Human Rights have taken a firm stand against the taking of hostages. However  France  which took the initiative in submitting this question to the Commission on Human Rights  wishes to emphasize the need to supplement these texts  whose political significance is evident  with the concrete measures the situation calls for.The determined action required would be made easier if all States were effectively to meet the obligations incumbent upon them under international law and conventions to which they have subscribed.I venture to hope that the appropriate reaction of the international community expressed here will encourage all States to co-operate  particularly in the strengthening of air and maritime security  and convince them of the need to work through all appropriate channels  national and other  to eradicate terrorism.Since the United Nations was founded the Organization and the entire international community have had to face up to the strategic realities of the -nuclear age.France is convinced that nuclear deterrence  which has prevented a direct confrontation between the two super-Powers for the past 40 years  remains anirreplaceable factor for peace and that there is no alternative within human grasp in spite of the rapid progress taking place in advanced technology  progress in which France has equipped itself to play a full part. tIn view of the considerable disproportion in existing arsenals  any progress towards nuclear disarmament must begin with verifiable  progressive and balanced reductions in the entire range of American and Soviet strategic weapons systems. These reductions must be carried out under such conditions that the balance of nuclear deterrence is not called into question.All the speakers here have stressed the importance that progress in the current negotiations in Geneva between the Soviets and theAmericans could have for East-West relations. France has already said many times that it would welcome a priori such prospects as might be opened by a Soviet-American summit meeting this year. It recognizes in particular the political importance that an agreement on a global limitation on intermediate-range weapons systems could have in the world. It must  however  observe that the reduction of those systems would affect only a very small part of the nuclear arsenals of the United states and the Soviet Union.The President of the French Republic recalled in 1983 from this very rostrum the conditions which France has set for its participation in a nuclear disarmament process when the time comes. I should like to repeat here that these conditions will not change and that France will not agree to its forces being take) into account  directly or indirectly  in negotiations to which it is not a party.As long as French security rests on nuclear deterrence  the first requirement f or ray corn try is to maintain the credibility of its strategic forces at the necessary level. For that reason  France has naturally declined to go along with any form of planned obsolescence of its forces while other Powers retain a huge excess nuclear capacity. It will accept neither a quantitative nor a qualitative freeze on its arsenal nor will it halt its nuclear tests. That arsenal does not exceed the level considered indispensable for our security and our independence. The nuclear tests are being carried out in unquestionably safe conditions that have been recognized as such by independent and undisputed experts from the countries of the Pacific to whom France has allowed access to its test site  other States regularly carry out many tests and none of them provides or has provided such guarantees on the international level.With regard to Europe  the problem of security cannot be reduced solely to itsnuclear aspects. What distinguishes our continent from all the others is that thepermanent wound of its division is compounded by an unequal arms build-up of conventional and chemical weapons unmatched elsewhere in the world.Several years ago France proposed that in the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe an approach should be sought that would make it possible  in stages  to bring greater transparency to military activities and hence greater trust throughout our continent before initiating a gradual return to a lower level of the balance of armaments. In that spirit and  I would recall  on the basis of the French proposal  the Conference on disarmament in Europe was convened. It completed its work at Stockholm last week. We are pleased that the first East-West agreement on security to be reached in nearly 10 years came about in that context. This result should enable the follow-up conference of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which will meet shortly in Vienna  to make headway in all fields covered by the Helsinki Final Act - among them  human rights  the free movement of individuals  contacts among people -which  just as much as security and disarmament  affect the progress of East-West relations.In regard to nuclear energy  France  like the rest of the world  was disturbed by the Chernobyl accident. The accident must be judged with due gravity and seriousness. On the other hand  it should not serve as a pretext for those who seek to speculate on fear and irrational sentiment. The analysis recently completed in Vienna by international experts confirms the specific nature of the Soviet reactor; the lessons of the Chernobyl tragedy cannot be transferred as such and applied to Western-type installations.France decided several years ago to base its energy independence on nuclear energy. That goal is well cm the way to being reached today and cannot be brought into question. Conscious of what is at stake  France will naturally work for greater co-operation on safety already under way in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. But I should liKss to make the point here that the power to regulate in such an area must belong quite clearly to those who alone have the responsibility  capability and means to put into operation both the installations themselves and the regulations - in other words  national Governments  in the same spirit  France will continue to help interested countries acquire the benefits of the civilian applications of the atom once there is appropriate international monitoring to guarantee that the fruits of such co-operation are not diverted.France and its partners in the European Space Agency have decided to confront the great challenge of the peaceful exploration of space. We for our part are resolved to prevent a gap from developing in this field between nations that would move ahead for their own advantage and the others  which would be denied the benefits of applications vital for their development: earth observation  meteorological applications  navigation  communications transmission and direct television. France will continue to work to further existing international co-operation and develop the co-operation planned for the years ahead.We are bound to note today that the economic and financial situation of numerous third-world countries  especially the least developed among them  appears to have grown much worse. The situation is especially critical in Africa  and the special session which once again this year the General Assembly fortunately devoted to the problem highlighted the dimensions of the problem.The African corn tries know from experience that the efforts they have courageously decided to undertake will have the resolute and fraternal backing of France. Our commitment stems from the close relations we have with our partners to the north and the south of the Sahara. It also results from our awareness of the exceptional seriousness of the crisis  whose internal and external causes have been analysed with exemplary lucidity by the States concerned. The crisis affects almost the entire continent  which still encompasses two thirds of the world's least-advanced countries. France provides more aid to sub-Saharan Africa than any other country. Its contribution to the development of the continent as a whole has not flagged over these past years. No one should doubt that this will continue in the future.Certain regions in the third world whose economic development has been disastrous are also victims of threats to their security  and I should like to say a few words here about the sadly telling case of Chad. The difficulties and handicaps of every kind that that country's leaders have had to face are widely known. They have once again been compounded by attempts on the part of its neighbor  Libya  at destabilization  by occupation of part of the territory and  lastly  by overt military aggression. The Government of Chad received  when it has so requested  the support of France. The aid we provided  and in particular themilitary assistance  was intended  while deterring Libya from pursuing its offensive activities  to prepare what will doubtless be a long and difficult road towards national reconciliation and reconstruction in Chad.In the case of Chad  as in many other cases  the relationship between underdevelopment and insecurity and  consequently  the level of armaments  has been constantly demonstrated. Some years ago France proposed that this crucial problem as a whole should be the subject of political examination at the United Nations. Following the debates of the experts  it now remains to give concrete substance to this plan  either at the next special session of the General Assembly on disarmament or  if a consensus emerges  at a special conference to be held at an earlier date.I should like  finally  to say a few words about the question of debt. For all too many developing countries debt has now become a dominant concern. The day-to-day effort to meet payments on due dates mobilizes all their energies. It does not permit Governments the freedom necessary to resolve their long-term development problems.Over the past few years  there has been a great deal of consideration of this question. The very volume of such discussion shows that the international community has awakened to the seriousness and  at the same time  the complexity of the situation. Debt  in itself  is the consequence of the distorted development of the international economy which has brought us to the situation in which we find ourselves today.It is for that reason that no one can any longer claim that the issue can be resolved in a purely mechanical manner by granting short-term facilities or through the simplistic application of miracle remedies. If we are to solve the problem in a lasting manner  we must tackle the root causes of the situation and not simply its effects.The world facing a crisis of exceptional gravity  a phase of structuraladaptation in the international economy requiring greater internationalcooperation so that it will be more imaginative  more active and more pragmatic. I am fully aware that not everyone is convinced that this is necessary  but I think that the movement is in the right direction. France  for its part  believes that we must increase international co-operation in three areas. First  there must be increased financing for developing countries to loosen the grip of debt. I should add that there is no instance of a country that has not had to have recourse to substantial external financing during its industrialization phase. This is obvious  and in this area I note some progress  both in thinking and in conduct.Broad agreement is now emerging on the need to expand the role and enhance the intervention capabilities of multilateral development institutions Each of us recognizes that every other kind of financial assistance is also needed  in particular from international commercial banks and from States  in the form of aid for development and commercial credit.With regard to bilateral aid for development  France will again increase its effort in 1987 over 1986  with a view to reaching its goal of 1 per cent of gross national product.Secondly  the remarkable efforts to ensure economic recovery embarked on by developing countries  especially by the most heavily indebted among them  must be continued. Outstanding results"" have already been achieved in the battle against internal and external deficits  in curbing inflation and in implementing bold economic policies that emphasize the long-term interests of nations rather than favor illusory  fragile short-term solutions. It takes courage to set up and implement such policies  and I should like to pay tribute to those who have taken such initiatives.A single statistic will suffice to illustrate the importance of such efforts: the balance-of-payments deficit of non-oil-exporting countries has fallen from $73 billion in 1982 to $29 billion in 1986.Lastly  it is absolutely essential to correct the current disorders in the international economic and financial system. The solution to the debt problem must be based on the resumption of sustained economic growth in the world economy. This should be a key objective of the industrialized countries> which have a primary responsibility in this regard.The progress made in the war against inflation should enable us to continue to lower real interest rates  without which any lasting solution of the debt problem would be illusory  and to continue to move towards greater stability of the international monetary system.The correction of financial imbalances should also be actively sought. It is not a healthy situation when the world's greatest industrial country continues to drain off such a sizable In this context  France welcomes the success of the Punta del Este conference and hopes that the new round of negotiations to be launched will make it possible to liberalize world trade and to strengthen solidarity among nations.Freedom in all its dimensions - political  economic  cultural and religious - is being flouted in too many countries. War and terrorism are spreading insecurity and fear. The dignity of the human person is in jeopardy in every part of the world where hunger  poverty and violence reign.Whatever ideologists may say  the values of dignity and freedom are inscribed in the conscience of all mankind. France  for its part  intends to defend those values wherever it is present in the world  as well as within this Organization  which would be failing in its mission if it resigned itself to compromise or impotence.Off all the challenges I have mentioned  two seem to me of more urgent response than the others.One is terrorism  which would take us back to a time we thought long past if we allowed it a free hand to undermine democratic societies and destroy the basic rules of international life.The other is the critical situation of many third-world countries  particularly the least advanced among then. It is inconceivable that we should allow them to be crushed under the weight of their economic and financial difficulties - inconceivable  inhuman and irresponsible.Over and above the problems encountered by our Organization  even in its day-to-day functioning - problems which I am convinced will be resolved - the wisdom and intelligence so often demonstrated by this Assembly encourages me  in turn  to make a confident appeal to all the Member States.As I said at the beginning of my remarks  the internationalization of problems does not of itself entail international solidarity. In this regard  the development of co-operation at the regional level is an encouraging first step. Everybody knows that France in particular sets great store by intensifying its co-operation with its partners in the European Community.The urgency of the challenges that I have just mentioned compels us to set awareness of the need for this solidarity above our economic differences and political divergences. Let us all  therefore  understand that the dangers confronting mankind are common to us all and that the only response is to be found in solidarity.The PRESIDENT; On behalf of the General Assembly  I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the French Republic for the important statement he has just made."
"51",2528,"GBR",41,1986,"Mr. President  I welcome you to your prestigious office with the same warmth which exists between our two countries - both members of the CeraHonweaifcu. I share with you some knowledge of the English Bar and know that you will show the dedication  wisdom and objectivity which  if I may say so  is the hallmark of our legal profession.I cannot fail at the same time to pay a tribute to your predecessor  who represents a fellow member of the European Community. Ambassador de Pinies has had a distinguished career at the United Nations  crowned by his handling of the fortieth anniversary session  which captured world attention. He did not disappoint the high expectations we all had of him.Nor can I omit to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General and to say how happy I am  how happy we all are  to see him restored to health. His modesty and patience - qualities which once again showed through in his annual report - are an example to us all.I have the honor to address the General Assembly today on behalf of the European Community and its 12 Member States.Forty years ago  on 19 September 1946  Winston Churchill had this to say of Europe:""Over wide areas a vast quivering mass of tormented  hungry  care-worn and bewildered human beings gape at the ruins of their cities and homes and scan the dark horizons for the approach of some new peril  tyranny or terror."" A generation later it is sobering for us in Western Europe to remember those words. They remind us of the full destructive force of what Churchill  in a later speech described as:""Ancient nationalistic feuds and modern ideological factions [which] distract and infuriate the unhappy  hungry populations.""The destructive power of Churchill's ""feuds and factions"" is undiminished  and it is for that reason I wish to dwell for a moment on the more hopeful experience of the European Community. I say this with great humility; for in this century  as often before  we Europeans have feared and distrusted  fought and plundered one another. Yet today 12 free countries of Western Europe can speak to the world with a single voice; and we can do so in the conviction that we shall never attack one another again.The Community is an ambitious undertaking. The decisions we take in our Community can change the laws of all our countries. They touch the life of all our citizens. Of course it sometimes takes us time to agree; but we believe other nations could profit from the same stability and trust which we have built in Europe since 1945. This mutual trust has allowed us to build up our joint political and economic strength. We are determined to go on advancing our interests together. Let there be no doubt: a challenge to one of us is a challenge to all: whether it be to our liberties  interests  rights or well-being; whether it comes from terrorists or drug-dealers  from bullies or from tyrants.Last year my predecessor  Jacques Poos  the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg  spoke here as representative of 10 members of the European Community. It is my privilege to address you on behalf of 12 member States  for the Community has welcomed two new members - Spain and Portugal. Their accession weaves two more strands of European culture and history into one ever-thickening cable. Meanwhile the construction of Europe goes on. We are ratifying new treaty provisions on foreign policy co-operation. And by the end of 1992 we mean to have broken down the barriers that still divide the Community; so that  from Aberdeen to Athens  from Copenhagen to Cadiz  goods  services and capital and  by no means least  people  can move freely between us.Our Community has learns to work together in domestic affairs. It is now the world's single greatest trading bloc.Individually we have made powerful contributions to world affairs: our contribution must and will grow  now that we act together. The principles of the Charter of the United Nations have always been basic to our Community. He believe that our history imposes on us a particular responsibility to work for those principles and to promote in the world the ideal of dialog and peaceful co-operation which has served the member States so well.But Europe  the wider Europe  remains divided. Twenty-five years ago the Berlin wall cast its shadow between East and West. Barbed wire and concrete set neighbors and families apart from each other. These man-made divisions oblige us  as Europeans  to search for reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between nations. Our common history and culture encourage us to believe we can succeed.The accident at Chernobyl  to which the Soviet Foreign Minister has just referred in his own speech  has added a new dimension to exchanges between East and West. Let us hope that the lessons of that accident will be well learned. As Martin Luther King Jr. said  in a different context:""We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.""For us in Europe  as for the rest of the world  better relations between the two super-Powers are of the greatest importance. We warmly welcomed the Geneva summit meeting last November between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev. We share the widespread hope that there will be another summit this year. That prospect has already produced major proposals by both sides. We therefore much regret that the arrest of a respected American journalist in Moscow has cast a cloud over those hopes. We look for its early removal.The Geneva negotiations have as one priority the prevention of an arms race in outer space. The other urgent priority is deep cuts in the strategic and intermediate forces of the United States and the Soviet Union. We believe that the United States  the Soviet Union and Europe can make significant progress towards disarmament without compromising their security. An early agreement on the world-wide elimination of chemical weapons should and must be obtained.Even if the objective of general and complete disarmament can only be gradually achieved  it nonetheless remains our ultimate goal. But agreements will have lasting value only if they are fair  balanced and verifiable. And if confidence is to grow  existing arms control agreements must be respected by all parties. We are approaching a critical period: there is an opportunity for major decisions. Future generations will not forgive failure.Arms control and disarmament negotiations are only part of East-Westrelations. Practical steps are needed to overcome the tension and divisions that lie behind the high level of armaments.That is why the Helsinki Pinal Act is so important. It is fundamental for the health of East-West relations that all the Helsinki commitments should be honored. We look to all the participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) process to do so. At the CSCE follow-up meeting in Vienna  we will press for the sort of steps which ordinary people in our countries can see and understand.The Twelve warmly welcome the successful conclusion of the Stockholm conference last weekend. The agreement that has been reached there is a significant contribution towards reducing the risk of war in Europe and towards establishing greater confidence between East and West. The Twelve  who made a substantial contribution to that result  will seek to build on it both in the field of arms control and  more widely  in the CSCE process.Although Afghanistan and Cambodia are two countries far distant from our own  the outside interventions there symbolize many of the problems we face in East-West relations and in working for greater stability in the world at large. In Afghanistan in particular  some small detachments of Soviet troops may be withdrawn  but over 110 000 Soviet troops will still remain.Tens of thousands of Afghan citizens have been killed as a result of the Soviet occupation. They will not return to life. Four million people remain outside their country  living as refugees. Many of them have been taken in by Pakistan  which has been rewarded by numerous attacks launched across its border from Afghanistan.Speaking for a moment as the Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom  I cannot refrain from observing that it was in this context that the Foreign Minister of theSoviet Union said that ""the time has come to learn to call things by their proper names."" I cannot refrain from expressing my astonishment and dismay that the facts which I have just described - the events which have taken place in the past six years in Afghanistan - were described by the Soviet Foreign Minister as ""a national  democratic revolution"". If that be their view  then it is not a view that can be shared by the rest of the world.Speaking again for the Twelve  the principles we seek are those that must underlie a solution. They have been massively endorsed by the Assembly on many occasions. The Soviet Union should implement those principles  withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan and agree an acceptable timetable without delay. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to resolve the conflict. Only the success of those efforts - and soon - can prevent further suffering.Few parts of the world have suffered more than the Middle Bast from the ancient feuds and modern factions of Churchill's phrase. Our approach is the same: to counsel dialog and co-operation. There are no military answers to the conflict in the Middle East or in North Africa.A just  lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israel dispute can be achieved only through negotiation. We take encouragement from the agreement between Egypt and Israel over Taba. We have made our own views known on many occasion  and we stand by them. An international conference could make a major contribution if the gap between the parties could be narrowed and if they could agree on the principle and nature of such a conference.All parties should clearly and unambiguously accept two principles: the right to existence and security of all States in the area  including Israel  and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and all that that implies.We appeal to the parties concerned - the Arab States  Israel and the Palestinian people - to open the door to peace by recognizing each other's rights.The Twelve are working individually and collectively to help development in the occupied territories. We call on Israel  pending its withdrawal in accordance with Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  scrupulously to fulfill its obligations as the occupying Power and to ease restrictions on political activity and economic development. But such measures must be a prelude to  not a substitute for  true peace negotiations.Six years ago this month  the conflict between Iran and Iraq broke out. It has claimed well over half a million casualties and gravely damaged both countries. It is a source of great concern to their neighbors in the Gulf  with whom we sympathize. We have unreservedly condemned the use of chemical weapons and the escalating attacks by both sides on shipping in the Gulf. The two countries should ask themselves what possible good is served by continuing this conflict. We would deeply deplore any further escalation.It should be accepted equally by both parties that this conflict can only be brought to an end by negotiation. Security Council resolution 582 (1986) forms the best basis for such a negotiated settlement. We urge Iran and Iraq to agree an immediate ceasefire and to seek a peaceful  honorable solution to their differences  co-operating fully with the Secretary-General in the exercise of his good offices.In the Western Sahara  as well  we appeal to the parties to respond positively to the Secretary-General's efforts to find a peaceful solution.The United Nations is doing vital worth the effort to preserve Lebanon's sovereignty  unity independence and territorial integrity. We deplore recentincidents which have put new obstacles in the way of the mission of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We extend our sympathies to the victims. We wish to underline the urgency and importance of taking measures to enable the Force to carry out its mission safely and effectively. The latest events have demonstrated how intolerable the present situation has become.I now turn to the problem of Cyprus  which after too many years remains an important matter of international concern. The island remains tragically divided. The Twelve reaffirm their strong backing for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus  in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions. We stand fully by our previous statements.In particular  we reject any action that purports to establish an independent State within Cyprus. As we have made clear on many occasions  we support the Secretary-General in his mission of good offices for a just and viable solution to the problem. We ask all concerned to co-operate with him and not to take any action that would make his task more difficult.In South Africa  the Twelve have worked to promote the genuine national dialog that is so obviously and urgently needed if there is to be a peaceful solution to the country's problems. South Africa's policies also affect its neighbors. We have forcefully condemned its armed incursions against neighboring countries. There must be no recurrence of those armed raids.The Twelve have repeatedly made clear their revulsion at apartheid  we have demanded that it should be abolished. We utterly reject a philosophy which denies opportunity or liberty to one child yet gives ordinary rights and privileges to another solely on the basis of his or her colour. Such a system breeds hatred and violence. There have been reforms in South Africa  but too few and too slow to stem the surging bitterness and bloodshed in the country. The present state of emergency has brought desolation to the homes of many thousands of people imprisoned without trial and has worsened  not improved  the prospects for peaceful change.Violence will not end apartheid. Instead  conditions must be created in which dialog can begin.  But dialog is impossible while black leaders remain imprisoned or detained and black organizations proscribed. That is why the Twelve have repeatedly called on the South African Government to release unconditionally Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners and to lift the ban on the African National Congress  the Pan African Congress of Azania and other political parties.In September 1985 the European Community countries agreed on a series of measures - some restrictive  some positive - designed to impress on the South African Government the inescapable need for fundamental reform. In June this year  at The Hague  the European Council decided to take additional action. As part of that action  Heads of State and Government of the Twelve asked me to undertake a mission to southern Africa. In the course of two visits to the area ^r July I sought to explain the policies of the Twelve to South Africa's neighbors and to impress upon the South African Government our deep concern and the need for steps to encourage a peaceful negotiated solution.In the absence of any progress in that direction  and having consulted the major Western industrialized countries  the Twelve agreed at Brussels last week toimpose a ban on new investments in South Africa and on the import of iron  steel and gold coins from South Africa. Those measures represent a further step reinforcing the measures we took last year  which included bans on all exports to and imports from South Africa of arms and paramilitary equipment  a ban on oil exports and a ban on all new co-operation in the nuclear field.In addition we are implementing a concerted European program to help the victims of apartheid  both individually and collectively. We are helping those arrested under the state of emergency and we are putting heavy emphasis on programs of training and education for black South Africans. We are also helping South Africa's neighbors  for example over the improvement of transport facilities in the region.We shall keep up our effort in all these areas and do everything we can to promote urgent and peaceful change.Time is short. We appeal to the South African Government to look to the future  to accept that fundamental change is inevitable. That Government clearly understands the demographic and economic challenge. South Africa's white leaders are sowing the wind; unless sincere negotiation begins now  their own children will reap the whirlwind.The South African Government also bears a heavy responsibility in Namibia. Last year it set up a so-called transitional government of national unity. That body has no status whatsoever under the United Nations plan. We cannot accept unilateral moves by South Africa to transfer power in Namibia. We call upon the South African Government to implement the United Nations plan without further delay.Central America is another area where armed force will solve nothing. dialog and peaceful negotiation are the only way forward. A political solution isof the highest importance and it must emerge from the region itself. We support the Contadora peace process  which is a major step in the right direction  but further effort is needed by all concerned to reduce regional tensions. .*t Luxembourg last November we established a political dialog with Central America to underline our active support for that process in the interests of stability and pluralistic democracy. We also signed a co-operation agreement. We reiterate our intention to increase our aid to the region substantially in order to encourage regional co-operation and economic development.On behalf of the United Kingdom I shall be circulating a document  a separate national communication  on the FaIklands.More widely in Latin America  we have been encouraged by the continuing consolidation of democracy in most countries of South America. We hope that this process will continue throughout the region. But problems certainly remain in some countries. We have made plain our particular concern about human rights abuses and the continuation of violence in Chile. The Chilean Government has re imposed a state of siege following the attempted assassination of General Pinochet  we view this development with deep concern and reiterate our hope that the Government will immediately release political prisoners and initiate without delay a dialog with the democratic opposition about a peaceful restoration of democracy.The human rights abuses in Chile and South Africa are by means unique. This Assembly cannot remain indifferent in the face of the systematic violations of individual liberties  of the tyranny  oppression and indiscriminating violence which persist in many countries and of the fact that hunger  disease and lack of opportunity deny the most basic economic and social rights to countless people.On 21 July this year we issued a statement setting out our principles in this field. That was a signal of the high priority we attach to human rights in ourinternational relationships. This Assembly has established clear standards - in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international instruments. We seek the universal observance of those instruments. That is  what our people expect  not just fine words  so we attach particular importance to maintaining and strengthening the mechanisms established by the United Nations for the protection of human rights.The scourge of international terrorism has brought a new precariousness to modern life. It has killed innocent people in airports  shopping arcades and crowded streets. We utterly condemn cowardly attacks like the Karachi hijack and the recent atrocities in Istanbul and Paris  which can do nothing to help the political causes that their perpetrators profess to believe in. Our horror is greater when sovereign States lend their support - moral or material - to the terrorists. This year we have taken certain steps to deter State-supported terrorism  particularly in the case of Libya. No country which supports terrorism can expect to enjoy normal relations with the Twelve. We are determined to do more  and a ministerial meeting of the Twelve will be taking place on 25 September to consider future action. We shall not tolerate such behavior by supposedly responsible Governments.So  too  the problem of drugs demands an urgent collective effort. International drug trafficking is now on a scale that threatens to undermine whole societies. Close international co-operation is required to defeat this evil trade. We shall play our part at the World Conference in Vienna next June - a valuable initiative by the Secretary-General.Economic issues have been central to the development of the European Community. It is now the world's largest trade grouping  accounting for 20 per cent of world trade. We are the world's largest importer  in particular of products from developing countries  amounting to $US 105 billion in 1985. Our320 million citizens are linked to some 400 million people in Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific through our trade and aid agreements with their countries. We are collectively the largest donors of aid in the world. This economic weight gives us certain responsibilities towards the world's trading systems and we take these responsibilities seriously.Since the Second World War  growth in world trade has been stimulated by the progressive dismantling of the tariff barriers that existed between the two world wars. Nevertheless there are strains in the world trading system. Old traditional industries in the Western world have faced massive contraction as comparative advantage has passed to the newly industrialized countries  with traumatic social changes for those involved. Pressures for import controls have grown. They look like easy solutions  but they are not.Protectionism above all penalizes developing countries by reducing access to prime markets in developed countries. In the developed countries themselves  protectionism penalizes consumers by increasing prices and restricting choice and exporters by increasing their production costs. ProtsGfeicnisa is self-defeating. A spiral of retaliatory protectionist measures would have disastrous effects on world trade  particularly for the third world. Let us always remember that trade fosters growth.The contracting parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have just concluded their ministerial meeting at Punt a del Este at which an important agreement has been reached to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Community has worked hard for a successful outcome. Multilateral trade negotiations serve two purposes: to renew the GATT system  bringing it up-to-date with the realities of world trade  and to pursue trade liberalization by allowing countries to make concessions multi later ally that they may find difficult to make bilaterally. If we all share the burden of adjustment  we spread the pain. We are fully committed to this process.You may ask what the Community is doing to give effect to these admirable principles. Let me give two brief examples:First  in the textiles sector  the Community has achieved a. remarkable degree of restructuring. The Community is glad that the new Multi-Fiber Arrangement agreed in July foresees the application of GATT rules to trade in textiles as a final objective and calls for all participants to co-operate in the progressive liberalization of the textile trade. The Community also argued strongly for the particularly favorable treatment that the new Multi-Fiber Agreement gives to theleast developed countries.Second  agriculture is a major political issue  and one that mnst be tackled urgently. There has been a revolution in food production in the last 10 years. New technology has meant new fertilizers  fatter cattle  new types of grain and rice  more efficient storage. India is now exporting food. China is virtually self-sufficient. These are great success stories which serve as an inspiration to those struggling to overcome food shortages.Ironically  more plus more can equal less. Too much food in some countries can aggravate food shortages in others.Expensive producers growing more can cause poorer producers to grow less. The result is a tragic paradox: that even in an age of plenty  famine persists. Meanwhile trade disputes become political conflicts  as countries compete to subsidize their food exports  and dispose of their growing surpluses.We have to address these problems now. While recognizing the importance of agriculture for the well-being of rural communities  the Tokyo Summit agreed on the need ""to redirect policies and adjust the structure of agricultural production in the light of world demand"". The Community is committed to this. Heads of Government agreed at the European Council in The Hague in June that ""a better control of total production must be ensured so that it is better adjusted to the market situation"". This is not the responsibility of one country or group of countries. The problem is world-wide  and we can only deal with it - in the words of the Tokyo declaration - in co-operation with each other. Last week  GATT Ministers agreed to launch a new GATT round  including negotiations on agriculture. We have no more important task than to make this a success. The Tokyo Summit was also an important opportunity to review progress on the debt problem. The annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMP) and World Bank are less than a week away  so I shall be brief.The last year has seen important changes. International recovery may be in its fourth year  but the international economic environment remains unfavorable. Growth is still unevenly distributed throughout the world and growth rates are still lower than we want. Lower interest rates help us all  even if in real terms they are still high by historical standards. Oil price falls help many but severely affect others  and commodity prices generally remain weak. Many debtors have undertakes courageous adjustment programs of the industrializedcountries have reduced the imbalances of the early eighties which aggravated the difficulties facing debtors.The debt burden remains heavy for a number of countries. The Community fully supports the United States initiative for sustained growth  which aims to meet the legitimate aspirations of debtor countries for growth through structural adjustment and economic liberalization with the necessary external financing. Or  in plain language  it recognizes that we sink or swim together. Those who expected instant results misunderstand the initiative and the problem's complexity. But much has been achieved. The World Bank has stepped up its policy-based loans. The IMF and World Bank are working more closely together. And  in recent weeks  they have shown a flexible and imaginative approach to the very difficult problems faced by the oil-producing countries.There has been much criticism that resource flows have declined. This may be so for the banks in the short term: it partly reflects falling short-term demand for loans. But the banks have a crucial role to play in support of the United States initiative. We are confident they will rise to that challenge. For their part the creditor countries are responding to the need to ensure adequate finance for adjustment through rescheduling at the Paris Club-  new export credits; aid program; and support for the international monetary bodies. The Twelve will support a general capital increase for the IBRD at the appropriate time  and they welcome progress towards a 3US 12 billion replenishment  IDA-VIII  to help the poorer countries.One way or another  be it bilaterally  multilaterally or through the institutions of the European Community  we provide one third of the world's official development assistance. We shall maintain and  where appropriate  expandthese flows to meet the commitments we have made individually to targets established by the United Nations.The problems of Africa are particularly acute. As the special session recognized in May  many countries face grave economic problems. But natural disasters such as droughts and man-made disasters such as civil war have made them far worse. We extend particular sympathy to the people of Cameroon who have suffered the appalling natural calamity of Lake Nyos.At the special session on Africa  African countries acknowledged the role they themselves must play. The industrialized countries  including the Twelve  agreed on the importance of increasing official development assistance to Africa  and on improving its quality and effectiveness. We maintain substantial bilateral aid programs and contribute to international and regional development agencies; in addition  we are making a substantial collective contribution through the Lome III Convention and other association and co-operation agreements.Finally  this Organization itself faces a very serious problems how to confront its own financial crisis. A number of countries  over the years  have either delayed payments or withheld contributions. The Twelve collectively provide just under 30 per cent of the United Nations budget. We believe that every State should sect its legal obligations. The Secretary-General has shown courage in proposing certain measures  endorsed by the General Assembly at its resumed session in the Spring  to deal with the short-term problem. But further measures are required. There is a clear need for changes in the system which will produce broader consensus on financial issues and help overcome the reluctance of some Members to meet their financial obligations.We are grateful for the work done by the Group of 18 high-level experts. We shall make a positive and constructive contribution to the discussion of their report. We support the creation of a new mechanism to consider the program and budget  structured so 53 to ensure effective decision-making and to contribute to greater rationalization and efficiency within the system. He are firm in our support for the Charter and for a strong and effective United Nations. Greater budgetary discipline  improved co-ordination  and rigorous adherence to priorities can only strengthen the Organization and ensure its future stability and vigor.As this Session will once again demonstrate  the world faces many grave problems - too many to cover in one speech; and I have not attempted to do so. So I am also circulating today as document A/41/634 a memorandum as a companion piece to this speech  describing our position on a number of other issues to.which we also attach the highest importance.Voltaire once observed that  in India and China  they believe that a prophet will come out of the West  whereas people in Europe expect their sages to come from the East. The lesson of this  perhaps  is that we all have something to learn from each other. The United Nations is a place to listen as much as to speak. And if we do so  perhaps we shall find to our surprise that we can learn from each others' experiences and profit from each others' good will.I have tried to show how our experience of co-operating together in the European Community has shaped our positions on a number of key issues facing this Assembly. I believe those positions  though ambitious in aim  are fair and realistic in practice. It is an approach which we believe fulfills the ideals to which this Organization is committed. In our search and support for freedom  peace  justice  democracy and prosperity for mankind  in offering our friendship to all who wish us well  we shall continue to pursue our duty to other nations  notably to those less fortunate than ourselves. At the same time we shall uphold and defend what we have built together."
"52",2599,"GHA",41,1986,"On behalf of the people and the Government of Ghana  I extend to the President our warmest congratulations on his election to preside over the forty-first session. His election is a tribute to his personal qualities and an honor to his country. To his immediate predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  I offer congratulations on a job well done.A year ago to the day we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. It was an occasion for renewing our faith in the organization and the ideals it stood for. Beneath the many and varied assessments made of the Organization  however  lay one incontrovertible truth - that its continuing relevance as the framework for international co-operation has not beendiminished by time or circumstance.perhaps at no time has that spirit of international co-operation and good willbeen better demonstrated than in the response to Africa's economic crisis duringthe special session in May. Although Africa did not achieve all its objectives the spirit of international co-operation and good will demonstrated at the specialsession was a gain for all.Ghana joins in expressing our gratitude to the international community for theinterest shown in Africa's economic recovery Program. What is urgently requirednow is that the expressions of good will be reduced to firm commitments to raisethe necessary resources for the program's success. In an increasinglyinterdependent world  the rest of humanity will not long remain spared Africa'smisfortunes. We therefore renew Africa's appeal to all  especially our partners inthe developed world  to translate their friendly understanding of our problems intopractical support. Africa's problems are many and deep-seated. There is no doubt about Africa's resolve to accept the challenges now facing the continent. But  while Africa's recovery is largely dependent on its own efforts  the fact remains that meaningful progress hinges on the international economic environment.Indeed  how can Africa make basic structural reforms in the face of the current wide fluctuations in commodity prices  the deterioration in the terms of trade  the decline in real terms of official development assistance  unstable exchange rates  high interest rates  protectionism  the heavy debt burden and a host of other unfavorable economic conditions which adversely affect our economic fortunes? it is a fact that  contrary to all reason  the world economic environment facilitates a far greater influx of resources from the developing countries to the developed countries than vice versa. Those factors contribute substantially to the aggravation of our continent's problems.It follows  therefore  that a meaningful solution of the nagging socio-economic problems of Africa - indeed  of the third world generally - call for a greater political will on the part of the international community  particularly the industrialized West  to address the root causes. So far that will has not been demonstrated. Initiatives taken by the developing countries to halt the decline in commodity prices and bring some stability to their export earnings have not received the support of some major industrialized countries. Thus  theestablishment of an integrated program for commodities and its common fund today remains a forlorn hope.If the developing countries expand their productive base  as is being advocated  it is unlikely that world demand will outstrip the increased supply and thus exert upward pressure on commodity prices. In all probability the increased supply will only depress prices. And  in any case  would there be increased access of the increased output to the markets of the industrialized countries? On presentperformance  the answer is likely to be ""No'.Debt repayment and servicing have put a great strain on the meager financialresources of the developing countries  including my own. It is estimated that in 1985 alone the net interest paid in external debt servicing by developing countries amounted to $4 billion. In recent years the debt service ratio has risen to unacceptable levels. Many countries have come to realize that they cannot cope with it without imposing intolerable sacrifices on their people  with serious implications for political stability. Unilateral ceilings on the percentage of export earnings that should be devoted to debt servicing have therefore been imposed by some countries  and unless there is greater understanding from creditorsthat practice is bound to grow.The deepening debt problem requires realistic and concerted international action. The repeated acts of rescheduling and the building up of arrears will  in the long run  only hinder development. Rescheduling creates a climate of uncertainty  while arrears can also lead to the halting of loan commitments and hamper the formulation of adjustment programs that can bring relief.in the international monetary area  problems of liquidity and a stable exchange rate regime remain. Special drawing rights (SDRs)  if they had been allowed to develop to their full potential  would have put decision-making in international liquidity creation into the multilateral context where it properly belongs. The position today is that the national currencies of a few countries continue to serve as reserve currencies. It is nearly 10 years since the last issue of SDRs was made  and they are shrinking as a percentage of total non-gold reserves. Yet during that period the need for access to international liquidity by many developing countries has never been greater. Coupled with the problem of international liquidity creation and allocation is the uncertainty in international financial transactions engendered by wide fluctuations in the floating exchange-rate system.When developing countries call for an international conference on money and finance  debt or trade  it must be understood that they do not seek confrontation. Rather  they seek an opportunity for a genuine and democratic dialog to find solutions to the complex problems afflicting the world today. They seek to mold international institutions in a way that will promote the well-being of all countries  what they cannot accept is prescriptions by a few countries through mechanisms on which they have no representation and in which their interests and concerns are given only perfunctory consideration.Although the world economy has in the last few years shown signs of recovery  serious imbalances in the international economic environment persist. For most of the developing countries  economic recovery in the past three decades has remained a pipe dream. But in an increasingly interdependent world lack of progress in one part has the inevitable effect of slowing down the dynamism of the other. The economic recovery of the developed countries  therefore  is likely to be short-lived if economic growth is not encouraged and induced in the developing countries.For those reasons  Ghana welcomes the emphasis which has been given lately to adjustment through growth. Past policies of demand management have caused considerable social hardship  particularly to vulnerable segments of the population  in countries pursuing structural adjustment. When we have made our best efforts  followed adjustment policy prescriptions to the letter and ended up creating more misery than we set out to alleviate  we are bound to raise fundamental questions about the system and its supporting mechanisms for restoring equilibrium - not an equilibrium based on the old unjust order  but one that gives all countries an equal opportunity to realize their full potential for economic and social development. The widespread recognition of the need to pursue growth-oriented policies must be accompanied by a corresponding recognition that the unfavorable external economic environment should be changed. In short  a new international economic order is called for. I wish to turn now to political Batters. The General Assembly's declaration of 1986 as the International Year of Peace presupposes that Member States would adhere strictly to their Charter obligations and resort to peaceful means in settling disputes. The year 1986 is fast drawing to a close but  unfortunately  the vision of a world at peace is far from reality. This is true both in the settlement of outstanding regional conflicts  which in the year have shown no signs of diminishing  and in the management of regrettable bilateral conflicts  in which force rather than peaceful negotiations have been the order of the day.Striking cases in point are South Africa's frequent incursions into the front-line States of Lesotho and Swaziland  and the recent barbaric bombarding of civilian targets in Zambia  Zimbabwe and Botswana  calculated to terrorize those countries to withdraw support for the liberation movements in South Africa and Namibia and to increase the racist regime's domination of those countries. South Africa is constantly in the news now and high on the agenda of several international meetings because the racist Pretoria regime has opted for the use of violence and terrorism upon those in southern Africa who legitimately protest against the continued practice of apartheid.The overwhelming majority of the international community favors the isolation of South Africa economically  politically and socially. The choice has been made above all others because it is the only peaceful means available to check the unhappy turn of events in that country from further deterioration and to put an end apartheid. Regrettably  there are certain Governments  including the United Kingdom  the United States  the Federal Republic of Germany  Portugal and Japan  which by their policies appear to support the racist regime. The Governments of these countries continue to oppose meaningful sanctions because they claim sanctions would hurt' the blacks in South Africa and the neighboring States. The fact of the matter is that the burden of apartheid is far greater than the economic deprivation they will suffer with sanctions.The liberation movements  which articulate the aspirations of the oppressed people of South Africa and the front-line States themselves  have openly advocated the imposition of sanctions and have declared their readiness to make sac if ices now to free themselves from the constant threat and application of violence by the racist Pretoria regime. It is sheer hypocrisy  in the circumstances  to oppose sanctions because of the effect this will have on the peoples of southern Africa.We have also been told that sanctions will not work  and insincere references have been made to historical parallels  such as that of what was then Rhodesia after Unilateral Declaration  of Independence. If sanctions do not work  why impose them on Poland  Libya  Cuba  Nicaragua and others? These claims overlook the gaping dissimilarities in the Rhodesian and South African situations and betray an obvious intent not to make sanctions work. We all know how the effectiveness of sanctions against Rhodesia was undermined by the Western world. The truth of the matter is that opposition to sanctions is based on fear of loss of material interests and on solidarity with persons of a common racial origin.Mandatory sanctions can work if they are comprehensive in scope and sincerely applied. They will work if we place humanity before narrow selfish benefits. They will work if we stop placing the employment of a few thousand workers before the fundamental human rights of millions of deprived blacks in South Africa.The apartheid system no longer has a place in this world. It must be dismantled now. We appeal once again to the racist regime in South Africa to free Nelson Mandela  Zaphena Mothopeng and all other political prisoners  and to initiate negotiations with the legitimate leaders of the black majority with a view to sharing power democratically with all South Africans  irrespective of race  color or creed.The question of the independence of Namibia continues to pose a serious challenge to the international community. It is unacceptable that South Africa still occupies Namibia 20 years after the General Assembly terminated its Mandate and assumed direct administration of the Territory. This fact in itself reflects a serious weakness of the United Nations which we should help to remedy. The best South Africa offered in terms of co-operation with the United Nations was when it participated in the pre-implementation talks held in Geneva early in 1981. But those talks failed to achieve any concrete results because of South Africa's arrogance and prevarication. Since then the Namibian independence issue has been deadlocked owing in part to the introduction by the Reagan administration of its so-called ""constructive engagement"" and ""linkage"" theories. These extraneous elements have played well into the hands of South Africa. The net result is that Namibia's independence plan  authored and sponsored by the Western Contact Group  and accepted unanimously by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978)  has remained unimplemented eight years after its adoption.The Namibian question is a decolonization issue and cannot therefore be linked with the domestic affairs of an independent country. The people and the Government of Angola have the legitimate right to make whatever practical arrangements they may think fit for the defence of their country  arrangements necessitated by South Africa's aggression and interference in their internal affairs. We therefore totally reject any attempt to link Namibia's independence with the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and we reiterate Ghana's support for the conclusions of the special session of the General Assembly on Namibia  which has just ended  and particularly  foe measures relating to the isolation of South Africa economically and politically  and for the immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).There are other hotbeds of tension on the African continent which deserve the attention of this session. With regard to Western Sahara  it is a matter of regret that what should have been a straightforward issue of applying the principle of self-determination to the inhabitants of that territory has degenerated into a war involving Morocco  which has itself in the past been a victim of colonialism. We reiterate our support for the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic and for the right of the Republic to sovereign existence  we call upon Morocco once again to enter into direct negotiations with the Polisario Front in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity and of the United Nations General Assembly  on the matter.In Chad  there seems to be relative calm now. But behind this facade is an uneasy situation that can no longer be tolerated  particularly at this crucial time when the people of Chad need to husband their limited resources to combat the effects of prolonged drought and the serious damage caused to their crops by pests. We remain convinced that the need for a lasting solution of the Chadian problem lies in national reconciliation. We therefore urge all the internal parties and the people of Chad to bury their differences and to seek a solution to their problem on the basis of dialog.In the Middle East we have continued to witness an unfortunate cycle of violence  particularly in Lebanon. The spectacle of an Arab turning on a brother Arab is most disturbing indeed and we wonder when the incessant tragedy will end. The grisly killings and the destruction of property in Lebanon should disturb the conscience of all those who believe in peace  brotherhood and progress. Over the past eight years Ghana has been involved in the international effort to assist the Government of Lebanon to maintain law and order and to preserve its territorial integrity. We shall continue to do so. However  we hope that all the factions involved in the continuing violence will assist in bringing peace to that country and in preserving its independence and territorial integrity.The situation in Lebanon is generally linked to the precarious question of the Middle East. We in Ghana continue to emphasize today  as we did last year  that the Palestine question is at the core of the Middle East problem. Lasting peace in that subregion will continue to elude us as long as justice is denied to the Palestinian people  """"nus peace will come only when Israel and its supporters listen to logic and reason. The display of military muscle will not promote peace in that area. On the contrary  such actions increase tension. Lasting peace can be achieved only on the basis of dialog among all the parties  includingespecially the Palestinians under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization.The insistence on pre-conditions and the attempt to make scapegoats of Libya and other countries of the subregion for terrorism is counter-productive. In this regard  Ghana deplores fresh threats of the use of force again Libya. Terrorism in the Middle East has its roots in the Palestinian question and its eradication can come about when there is full recognition of the rights of Palestinians to a homeland.I must  however  emphasize Ghana's opposition to and abhorrence of blind terrorism.The Cyprus situation also continues to be a natter of concern to the Government of Ghana. The recent incident resulting from the closure of border points by the Turkish Cypriots once again demonstrates the need for restraint by both parties. We again appeal for tolerance and flexibility  and we support the Secretary-General's mediation efforts. Ghana  for its part  will continue to support a unified and independent Cyprus free from external interference and is in favor of the settlement of communal differences through peaceful dialog.I new turn to the fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq. That war  now in its eighth year  is a matter of deep concern to the Government of Ghana  not merely because of the indescribable human carnage involved  but also because of the enormous resources being wasted by the two combatants - resources that could have been used to provide for the pressing needs of their peoples.we once again appeal to the friendly countries of Iran and Iraq to end the war and to resolve to settle their differences by peaceful means. We deplore the initiation and continuance of the war as being in violation of the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Charter of the United Nations and condemn the violation of international law by the use of chemical weapons  the inhuman treatment of prisoners and the indiscriminate bombardment of civilian targets.The situation in Central America has taken a turn for the worse as the result of the recent decision by the United States Administration to make available to the rebel forces fighting the Nicaraguan Government weapons and logistic support worth 8100 million. We say in a constructive spirit to our American friends that theirdecision is ill-advised and contrary to international law. It will only intensify conflict in the area.That decision  together with the assistance being given to the Savimbi bandits  poses a serious threat to the independence and territorial integrity of countries of the third world. It is a new dimension in the attempt to undermine the right of peoples of the third world to self-determination. Such a cynical disregard of the rights of others and of international law constitutes a great threat to international peace and security.We remain convinced that any attempt to pressure Nicaragua to abandon its search for a suitable form of government on the basis of the country's peculiar historical experience and culture will only result in conflict. The International Court of Justice itself has in recent decisions upheld the sovereign right of the Nicaraguan people freely to choose their own political  economic and social systems and has rejected as illegal any pressure on Nicaragua intended to subvert the popular aspirations of the people of that country.Ghana therefore endorses the Contactor a process as the only realistic way of finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the most serious conflict now raging in Central America. We urge all parties to enter into serious dialog within the Contadora framework.Ghana's commitment to the principle of self-determination demands that we not gloss over the ongoing developments in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. It is a natter of deep regret that in spite of the Secretary-General's mediation efforts  the problem of Afghanistan has not been resolved  nor is an end to the Kampuchean conflict in sight. In our view  the people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea must be left to determine their own future  free of foreign interference and occupation forces.We note with satisfaction the announcement by the Soviet Union of the withdrawal of some of its troops from Afghanistan and we hope that this process will be hastened and embrace all foreign forces on the territory. We also hope that this will be the case in regard to Kampuchea. We call on all parties involved in those conflicts to respect the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to agree to negotiate an end to those conflicts.The Korean problem also remains unresolved. That problem should  in our view  be solved through peaceful dialog by the Koreans themselves  without outside interference. We are pleased to note that steps have been taken in that direction and we hope that both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea will make a serious effort towards reunification.I now turn to the question of disarmament  which remains high on the agenda of all peace-loving peoples of the world. The specter of nuclear annihilation continues to threaten us all. This unhappy state of affairs is largely the result of the continuing deep mistrust and suspicion between the two super-Powers and their military allies. Contrary to reason  the belief that peace can be secured through strength lives on.New heights are being scaled in the arms race  and not even outer space will be spared. Enormous resources  which could make a difference between affluence and poverty for the under-privileged peoples of this world  are being spent. For how long can we continue along this path? Every one of us must assist in the momentous task of bringing the super-Powers to the negotiating table for complete disarmament in the interest of the survival of the human race. Recent events make us more hopeful of progress - not least  the current moves to put arras control talks bade on trade.If the Organization is to discharge its varied and heavy responsibilities effectively  it must have the necessary financial support. Unfortunately  the United Nations is undergoing a serious financial crisis owing principally to the withholding of funds by certain Member States for one reason or another. We see the present financial crisis as basically political in nature and  in a sense  areflection of the loss of faith in the multilateral system by some influential Members as the result of the fact that the United Nations system is no longer liable to manipulation by them.Both the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UN23C0) and the United Nations may be in need of some re form in regard to operating machinery  but the answer to that problem is not to undermine their existence. We certainly deplore any attempt capriciously to weaken these organizations or threaten their usefulness to developing countries or to turn them to the selfish advantage of the rich and powerful  in other words  we pledge to uphold the sacred principles of the Charter and the United Nations system  we call on all Member States  particularly the founding and influential Members of the United Nations  to fulfill their pledge to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.In conclusion  I wish to reassure the Assembly of my Government's commitment to the United Nations system and its ideals. The United Nations may not have been able to solve all our problems  but we do not think it has been endowed with the power required for that. However  it remains a shining example of what mankind can achieve through international co-operation  we have a duty to ensure that this unique experiment in human co-operation survives and continues to contribute to the creation of a happy tomorrow for generations to come. That should be the heritage that this generation leaves to posterity."
"53",2645,"GIN",41,1986," Please allow me  like preceding speakers  to extend to you  His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury  on behalf of the people of Guinea and of General Lansana Conte  Head of the Military Committee for National Recovery  President of the Republic and Head of State  our warm congratulations upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-first session. I am convinced that his mastery of international issues  his wisdom and his outstanding personal qualities constitute a guarantee that our deliberations will be successful.I should like also to extend my whole-hearted congratulations and appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  who so competently and diligently guided the proceedings of the fortieth session.My delegation would like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for the perseverance and foresight he has demonstrated in defense of the cardinal principles of the United Nations Charter  always with the object of giving the Organization the impact commensurate with the noble aspirations of the international community. His annual report this year objectively describes the current situation of our Organization.The political and economic evolution of the present-day world certainly does not inspire optimism. On the contrary  in spite of legal instruments developed by Member States to make their relations sounder in an atmosphere of harmony and sincere co-operation  we are witnessing a multiplication of hotbeds of tension  acts of aggression  an unbridled arms race and mistrust in international relations. In the economic field  a rising tide of protectionism  injustice in trade and a worsening of the foreign debt of the developing countries all threaten international solidarity and hinder the development of the third-world countries.The system of collective security established by the Charter is constantly obstructed  since the normal functioning of the Security Council  the organ that has the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  requires in the first place a minimum of trust among the great Powers. Rare are the issues on which the Council succeeds in reaching a decision; and when it does succeed it is not able to implement its own decisions. This is the tragic case with Namibia and also with the Middle East.Furthermore  while it was created in order to prevent conflicts and to stop tensions from mounting  the United Nations is no longer able to alleviate the consequences of those conflicts  being unable to tackle their causes because of theparalysis of the Security Council. Thus Africa  Asia and Latin America have today become the distressing arena of tension and rivalry in the contemporary world  prompting many States to arm themselves even beyond their means and thus heightening insecurity throughout the world. In fact  behind a facade of international gatherings and in spite of a degree of consultations never before seen in history  the community of which we form part seems engaged in a retrenchment towards isolated national entities.The United Nations is confronted with an unprecedented political and financial crisis which makes it more difficult for it to carry out correctly the tasks ■ entrusted to it and which narrows its field of action. It is time  here as in other areas  for the international community to assume its responsibilities with a view to ensuring respect for the Charter. Therefore genuine political will is required on the part of all  in order to bring about positive changes which may inspire greater trust in international relations.I should like now to turn my attention to a few specific problems to which my country  the Republic of Guinea  attaches great importance.Indeed  Guinea is convinced that the policy of detente will remain devoid of real significance if it is limited in its geographical bounds and its scope. Peaceful relations between the East and the West are certainly a necessary condition for international peace and security but they are not enough unless complemented by peaceful relations in the rest of the world.For that reason  on the African continent  the obduracy of the Pretoria Government in carrying out its policy of racial repression  in spite of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council  constitutes an affront to our Organization. In the case of South Africa we are faced with a unique paradox. The only regime in the present-day world which is Fascist in inspiration  it benefits nevertheless  almost unconditionally  from the support of certain countries which at the same time proclaim themselves indefatigable guarantors of respect for and promotion of human rights and democratic principles.It is because of the multinational firms and the support of certain countries that the Pretoria racists have been able since 1948 to maintain that anachronistic system of apartheid. We are convinced that a combination of internal and external pressure through the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions  under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  remains the only way to make it possible for a democratic and multiracial society to be established peacefully in South Africa.The Republic of Guinea  while strongly condemning the repeated acts of aggression by the hateful Pretoria regime against the neighboring and front-line States  once again expresses its unconditional support for and solidarity with the struggle of the people of South Africa under the guidance of its different national liberation movements. We request the unconditional liberation of Nelson Mandela and all other political detainees.As far as Namibia is concerned  resolution 435 (1978) of the Security Council remains the sole framework for the settlement of the Namibian question. It is up to the United Nations to ensure that it is fully and unconditionally implemented and thus to prevent all attempts to distort the process of decolonizing the territory. In this respect it is important to recall that Namibia is no sense a question of East-West relations  as some try to have us believe. It is purely and simply a question of decolonization  in which the international community has a great responsibility. Bearing this situation in mind  the Republic of Guinea will continue to give and strengthen its support for the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people  in its national liberation struggle.We also believe that that independence must in no way be linked to a prior withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola  which is  as far as we are concerned  a question of national sovereignty.In addition to southern Africa  there are many other focal points of tension on the African continent. In connection with Western Sahara  only the organization of a referendum on self-determination for the Sahraoui peoples  in accordance with the resolution of the eighteenth session of the summit conference of the Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and resolution 1514 (XV) of the General Assembly  could make it possible for a definitive solution to be found to the crisis. In this connection  my delegation appreciates the efforts made by the OAU and the Secretariat of our Organization  which have mediated between the different parties to the conflict.With respect to Chad  the Government of the Republic of Guinea believes that the withdrawal of all foreign troops and non-interference in the internal affairs of that country constitute a prerequisite for the establishment of a climate of peace  harmony and reconciliation among our Chad brothers. We commend all the efforts made by the Government of Chad in this noble effort at reconciliation under OAU auspices.As for the Horn of Africa  the talks that have been undertaken between Somalia and Ethiopia allow a measure of optimism that peace may be established in the sub-region. While Guinea encourages such initiatives  it feels that peace will be lasting only if the States of the sub-region overcome their differences in the higher interests of their respective peoples.Given the injustices suffered by the Palestinian people  the Republic of Guinea reaffirms its staunch support for that martyred people in its struggle for recognition and the exercise of its right to existence and national identity under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  its sole and legitimate representative. We support the appeal made for the urgent convening of an international conference on the Middle East  with the effective participation of all parties concerned and  especially  that of the PLO.The conflict between Iran and Iraq remains of concern to the international community and especially the Member States of the Islamic Conference. As a member of that organization and of the Islamic Peace Committee  the Republic of Guinea sincerely hopes that the parties to the conflict will demonstrate goodwill so as to put an end to that fratricidal war.In connection with the question of Cyprus  my country  while it hopes for the restoration of a climate of understanding and harmony in Cyprus  continues to gives its complete support to the positive action of our Organization for a just and lasting solution.The situation prevailing in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea constitutes a source of concern to the international community. The Republic of Guinea  faithful to the guiding principles of non-alignment  the Organization of African Unity  and the United Nations Charter  opposes all foreign interference in the internal affairs of those two States  which should be allowed in full freedom to determine the political system of their choice.In this respect  we believe that the eight-point document prepared by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea may constitute a basis of negotiations for a peaceful  just and lasting solution to the problem of Kampuchea.In connection with Korea  my delegation hopes that an atmosphere of brotherhood and understanding will be established in that country in which the people  who have suffered division and mistrust for a long time  have accomplished notable progress towards reunification. The people of Guinea and its Government welcome the many initiatives taken to ensure the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea  as well as the transformation of the Korean Peninsula into a nuclear-free  peaceful zone.Likewise  in Central America the peaceful settlement of conflicts should go side by side with regional guarantees for security with respect to the sovereignty of States. May the Contadora and support groups be assured of the support and esteem of the people of Guinea for their efforts towards the restoration of peace and socio-economic development in the region.I wish at this time to touch on economic issues which are of more concern than ever before. We deplore the fact that efforts of the international community to structure more equitable relations between the developed and the developing countries have not been more successful. In fact  forced to curb their development efforts because of the combined effects of the decline in the prices of exported goods and the increases in the cost of imported industrialized goods  most of the developing countries have recorded a considerable reduction in per capita income  and some of them are on the brink of economic bankruptcy  with disastrous consequences on the economic and social progress of their population.The factors that have made their situation worse and led to a standstill and even a considerable decrease in production are now familiar to all. They are primarily a drop in the real value of public aid to development  monetary instability  fluctuation of exchange rates  a high interest rate  a steady deterioration in the terms of trade  and a virtual disintegration of the multilateral trade system  strict lending policies on the part of financial institutions  the heavy debt and debt servicing burden  as well as protectionism on the part of the developed countries.The North-South dialog has become bogged down and has reached a dead end in all forums of the United Nations system. Some countries have even pitted some organs of the system against others  as though deliberations on international trade  industrialization  finances - for example  in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) - were encroaching on the competence of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (GATT) or the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  while in feet the activities of all these organizations are complementary and closely interrelated.Such an attitude reflects a challenge by many countries to multilateralism and their relegation of the fundamental problems of underdevelopment; to second place in their concerns.It is because of the distressing situation which our continent faces that  in May  the special session to consider the critical economic situation of our continent was held. It gave rise to great hope for our peoples and Governments  and provided an appropriate framework to further sensitize world public opinion on the problems confronting Africa.We urgently appeal to the entire international conn unity to make the contribution requested of it to ensure effective implementation of the priority economic recovery program for 1986 to 1990 that the peoples and the Governments of Africa are committed to carrying out.The demands of development in our various nations make it more than ever necessary to commit ourselves to resumption of the North-South dialog and global negotiations and the promotion of South-South co-operation  especially in the fields of science  technology and technological expertise  so as to encourage the kind of dialog that will ensure for our States collective self-reliance and harmonious  balanced  interdependent development.I should like to express my Government's appreciation to the international community and international institutions  from which the Republic of Guinea has had active support in the implementation of its economic and institutional recovery program.Another equally disturbing subject is that of disarmament and international security. Astronomical sums which could be used for economic purposes are used each year for the production of new  more sophisticated and more destructive weapons at a time when millions of human beings throughout the world are dying of hunger  disease and malnutrition. It is essential that the nuclear Powers begin genuine negotiations in an atmosphere of complete trust with a view to achieving general and complete disarmament  and that outer space is exploited for peaceful purposes only.With this position in mind  my country encourages and desires more contacts and negotiations among the nuclear Powers to promote detente in international relations  especially between East and West.Furthermore  my country believes that  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations  Africa must be kept outside the arms race.It is the fervent hope of the Republic of Guinea that the future of human beings in a more calm international atmosphere  free of any nuclear threat  will be guaranteed. In the course of its 40 years of existence the United Nations has done effective work to reaffirm the purposes and principles of the Charter. The role and importance of the Organization in an international atmosphere of conflict have been sufficiently demonstrated. That is why we believe that it is more necessary than ever before to strengthen the role of our Organization to enable it to be both more effective and operational.The democratic order which we cannot renounce and which is based on the equality of all sovereign States finds its ideal expression in the multilateral system. It is in this conviction that Guinea reaffirms its support for the United Nations as an instrument in the service of the higher interests of mankind as represented by a world of peace and progress in which man develops in freedom and justice."
"54",2684,"GMB",41,1986,"It is gratifying to see at the helm of this important - indeed  crucial - session a statesman of Mr. Choudhury's qualities and abilities. Far-reaching decisions are expected of this forty-first session  and we shall require all his skill and experience to guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion.I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to his able predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  who presided with distinction over the proceedings of the fortieth session.Twelve short months ago  as this family of nations gathered to commemorate the founding of our Organization  we.reviewed with justified pride the achievements of four decades of multilateral co-operation in the common quest for world peace  human dignity  and the social and economic advancement of all peoples. He agreed then that the United Nations  despite its imperfections  remained both the repository of the collective aspirations of mankind for a better world and theinstitution best equipped to achieve those goals  to which we renewed our solemn commitment. That commitment is now being put to the test.The international environment has undergone a revolutionary transformation during the 40 years that the United Nations has been in existence. Technological innovations have effectively reduced the size of our planet to that of a global village in which we have all become neighbors - dependent  each upon the other  for the very essentials of our existence.By the same token  however  we are all equally endangered by the ever-present threat of a nuclear apocalypse inherent in the spiraling a.'ms race. Regional conflicts  the current volatility of the international economy and the progressive degradation of the environment are other major issues of no less common concern. Never  therefore  has there been a greater need for concerted international action to address global problems.Yet the institutional machinery indispensable for such multilateral efforts is now displaying signs of a strain so severe as to call into question its continued viability. A variety of factors are at work here. Among these  we may identify the familiar Quadragenarian problem of middle-age spread  the inability of the Organization's structures and procedures to adapt to the changing demand of a dynamic international environment  and the dramatic shortfall in resources that now threatens to compromise the day-to-day operations of the United Nations.A number of steps have been taken in response to this state of affairs. In April  the Secretary-General announced a package of administrative measures aimed at reducing short-term operational costs. This was a timely initiative  which provided the breathing space needed to devise a longer-term response to the present crisis.We have now received and had an opportunity to study the report of the Group of 18  established to review the financial and administrative functioning of the United Nations  My Government considers that the Group is to be commended for the excellent work it has accomplished in the face of severe time constraints. We have noted and can in principle support its consensus recommendations aimed at enhancing the cost-effectiveness and over-all efficiency of the Organization's operations.We also note however  that on the fundamental questions of Program and budget  consensus has eluded the Group* This was perhaps to be expected given the widely divergent views of Member States on these matters. Responsibility for resolving those outstanding issues now rests with this Assembly  as the competent authority. In view of the clear consensus that has already emerged on the need to reform existing structures and procedures  the delegation of the Gambia is confident that a constructive and foe ward-looking solution is within reach.I do not believe  however  that this Assembly can content itself merely with keeping the United Nations afloat. Rather  if the Organization is to fulfill its vital role in today's complex international environment  we must address the underlying causes of the present malaise.To a very large extent  these are political in character. Indeed  one of the most basic problems facing the United Nations is the increasing tendency for Member States - particularly the more powerful  of whom better might be expected - simply to ignore their obligations under the Charter in pursuit of unilateral solutions to such international problems as concern them.That tendency has seriously undermined the authority of the United Nations  provoking a crisis of confidence in the Organization's ability to discharge its responsibilities. The result has been a vicious circle  in which the area of influence of the United Nations has been progressively narrowed. That trend must be arrested without further delay and the authority of the Organization reasserted so as to give it the chance of performing the task for which it was created.There is no more pressing issue before this Assembly than the appalling. situation prevailing in South Africa  where the brutal repression of the black majority has now reached an unprecedented level of savagery. The Gambia unreservedly condemns the barbarous practice of apartheid  which so completely denies the values and ideals upon which this Organization is founded and which has been rightly and repeatedly condemned as a crime against humanity.The black population/ meanwhile  has refused to be cowed into submission  but has intensified its valiant resistance against apartheid. I should like in this regard to pay a tribute to the heroic liberation struggle  in which all sectors of the oppressed population have been mobilized under the dynamic leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (K*C). It is this mass resistance to apartheid that has prompted the so-called reform re-assures out of which the racist regime and its apologists have sought to make so much capital.The real purpose of those maneuvers  however  has been to buy time in order further to entrench the status quo. This has been made brutally clear by the savage campaign of repression unleashed under cover of the protracted state of emergency. Another measure of the real nature of Pretoria's intentions has been the wanton acts of aggression  subversion and destabilization perpetrated against front-line and neighboring States. We condemn these repeated breaches of international peace and security.Its military might notwithstanding  however  the apartheid laager is doomed. History and justice are on the side of the oppressed masses. Freedom will come to South Africa; the only question is at what price. If a veritable bloodbath is to be averted  prompt coercive action is needed to bring Mr. Botha and his cohorts to the negotiating table.Although the authentic representatives of the majority population have themselves endorsed the almost universal call for sanctions  the imposition of such measures has thus far been prevented by a minority view within the Security Council. The argument advanced is that the most harmful effects of such action would be felt by the victims of apartheid. However well intentioned suchsentiments sight be  they constitute a major obstacle in the search foe a peaceful settlement and must be desisted from. However  we have noted and indeed welcomed recent positive developments in this regard.Another burning issue that cries out for solution is the continued illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa. This is a particularly brazen outrage  given the fact that since 1966 the United Nations has constituted the sole legal Administering Authority for the Territory. A comprehensive plan for the Territory's independence sponsored by the Western contact group and endorsed by both Pretoria and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  toe representative of the Namibian people  has been on toe table since 1978. Yet the racist regime whose capacity for duplicity is seemingly infinite  has invented one pretext after another to delay its withdrawal. It has imposed a puppet interim administration and Namibia's independence is now a hostage to the totally extraneous issue of the Cuban presence in Angola. This attempt at linkage has been condemned by no less important an organ than the Security Council.The long colonial nightmare of the Namibian people is now nearing the conclusion cf its 102nd year. This is not a matter regarding tAich the United Nations can afford complacency any longer. Rather  it is the very sort of challenge to the Organization's authority that has given rise to the crisis of confidence to which I addressed myself earlier. The situation  moreover  is precisely toe kind of contingency for which the provisions of Chapter VII were designed. Those provisions must not be allowed to remain a dead letter  but should be invoked forthwith so as to enable the Namibian people to exercise freely  fully and without delay its inalienable right to self-determination. In addition to the situation in southern Africa  a number of other regional conflicts are of concern to ray Government. The Middle East  once a cradle of civilization  now constitutes a hotbed of persistent tension. It will  alas  remain so as long as the issue at the heart of the Arab-Israeli dispute is not addressed substantively. I am referring to the continued denial by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independent statehood. I wish  therefore  to reiterate ray Government *s support for an international conference on the Middle East  to be convened under United Nations auspices with the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the authentic representative of the Palestinian people.With regard to the Iran-Iraq conflict  which has just entered its seventh year  I cannot but express deep regret that this painful and wasteful war continues to claim more lives and property despite the repeated appeals for the cessation of hostilities. It must be noted  however  that as far as the Islamic Peace Committee is concerned it will spare no effort in its quest for a just and honorable peace.His Excellency Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara  President of the Republic of the Gambia and current Chairman of the Islamic Peace Committee  has said:""Peace-seekers must never be discouraged  despite the attendant difficulties and frustrations.""It is in this context that we shall continue to seek a just and peaceful settlement of this unfortunate war.In the same vein  I have every reason to believe that it is through persuasion  perseverance and patience that the noble goals of the Islamic ummah will be achieved. Let us therefore hope and pray that Allah will bless these efforts with success.My Government is equally concerned over the situations prevailing  respectively  in Kampuchea end Afghanistan where the sacred right of self-determination has for a number of years bean ground under the iron heel of a foreign occupying Power. We therefore renew the repeated calls of this and other bodies for the prompt withdrawal of foreign troops as a prelude to the holding of free and fair elections.Meanwhile  on the Korean peninsula the painful reality of partition continues to represent a major source of tension. We are convinced that the road to the reunification of this ancient people is through bilateral negotiations based on a frank and sincere dialog. We also believe that the principle of the universality of the Organization's membership should be applied to the Korean people  with a view to permitting its early admission.I now turn to the subject of international economic relations - an issue of no less importance to my Government. It is indeed paradoxical that  in spite of the significant improvements in the economies of industrialized countries during the first part of the decade  international economic relations have been characterized by uncertainty and lack of confidence in the prospects for sustained growth and recovery in the developing countries. The vigorous upsurge in the major industrialized countries during the period led many to believe that confidence and buoyancy in international trade would be restored. Nevertheless  efforts aimed at generating growth and recovery in the majority of developing countries have been abortive  owing largely to a lack of political will and commitment on the part of industrialized countries.In the area of commodities  incentives for investment and production in the developing countries have diminished significantly in the wake of protectionist measures  resulting in a substantial loss of export earnings  mounting indebtedness and acute balance-of-payments problems. Against this background  I find it regrettable that  in spite of the efforts made to create mechanisms within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in favour of developing countries  industrialized countries have remained reluctant to reverse the negative trends in respect of trade in commodities  vigorous efforts have also been made to establish a Common Fund for Commodities  but some major industrialized countries have so far failed to ratify the agreement.It is therefore imperative to undertake concerted international action to establish an open multilateral trading system consistent with the commitment made at GATT in 1982 and at the sixth session of UNCTAD. In this spirit  we welcome the launching of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations  agreed on at Uruguay  as it is our firm belief that a new round will reverse current adverse trends and provide a stimulus to the liberalization of international trade. We also look forward eagerly to the meeting next year of the seventh session of UNCTAD  which we hope will address the critical areas of multilateral trade  particularly in the light of the special needs of developing countries in Africa.Only a few months ago  at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly  the international community addressed itself to the critical economic situation in Africa and  in a historic demonstration of solidarity with the African continent  agreed unanimously to launch a United Nations Program of action to complement the bold initiatives undertaken by African nations  within the framework of the African Priority Program for Economic Recovery (APPER). The latter represents the collective wisdom of African Heads of State or Government and their commitment to undertake radical economic and administrative policy reforms to meet the major challenges facing African countries.There can be no doubt that the special session succeeded in sensitizing the international community to some of the most daunting challenges facing the African continent in the twentieth century. However  the effectiveness and sustainability of the Program adopted will be determined by the concrete measures which the international community undertakes  consistent with the aspirations of African countries  it calls for the full participation of all countries  within the context of bilateral and multilateral institutions. It also calls for vigorous and sustained efforts on the part of the international community to stimulate development processes in African countries. In this regard  it is imperative to ensure that the eighth replenishment of the International Development Association and the fifth replenishment of the African Development Fund are effected speedily and at levels commensurate with the requirements for supporting recovery and development in Africa.Against the background of a global economic crisis and within the context of the Gambia's precarious economic circumstances  my Government has launched an economic recovery Program which centers on increasing agricultural productivity and expanding growth and employment in other productive sector  such as fisheries  energy and tourism  as well as reforms within the public sector. It also entails the improvement of the performance of the public enterprises  the rehabilitation of the financial sector and the improvement of the public investment Program. The ultimate aim of this comprehensive economic reform Program is to boost the economy and reverse the downward trend in economic growth and development. The adjustment Program adopted by the Gambian Government addresses both the need to improve the productive capacity of the economy through alleviating existing supply constraints and the need to pursue prudent demand management policies on a sustained basis in order to overcome present internal and external imbalances.It wist be emphasized that there is growing international interdependence in which mutuality of interest is the common factor. It is inevitable  therefore  that new economic arrangements and relationships need to be forced to consolidate the kind of interdependence between the industrialized and developing countries that is based on the sharing of responsibilities and rewards. This situation can materialize only if international trade evolves in such a manner that the reward for production in developing countries is equal at least in real terms to incomes for the same output in industrialized countries.The new relationship will also mean that in addition to obtaining fair prices the developing countries will take a greater share in the manufacturing and processing of goods for export. We should never lose sight of the fact that the long-term gains of the rich nations also depend on the economic performance of the poor countries. Trade in this case is the most effective avenue to sustained development. Of course  we also need aid  but the ultimate objective in giving aid is in fact to eliminate the need for aid itself.The desired change in the existing economic system cannot be achieved without access to technology and the reallocation and transfer of manufacturing industries to developing countries. To transfer and adapt appropriate technology to the needs of our predominantly rural societies  international agencies and friendly Governments should support research efforts by and with developing countries.Concrete results would be achieved if there were a massive and concrete transfer of technological know-how in the area of agriculture and food production. Food self-sufficiency could then be the basis of development  as indeed was the case in the developed countries  where improved agricultural methods and practices predated the development of industrialization.Finally  the fact that we in the South have opted for collective self-reliance instead of complete dependence on the volatile expectations of the North-South dialog is in itself a new order. This horizontal South-South dialog needs to be promoted  strengthened and widened  if we are to survive in our North-South dialog. The widening of our base necessarily encompasses all developing countries  not only because of our common aspirations but also because together we form a most formidable economic entity in terms of natural and human resources."
"55",2724,"GNB",41,1986,"First of all  I should like to tell you  Sir  how pleased my delegation is to see you presiding over the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly and to congratulate you most warmly on your unanimous election to that important post.In choosing you  the international community paid a well-deserved tribute to your country  Bangladesh  and demonstrated its great appreciation for your outstanding qualities as a seasoned diplomat and as a defender of the principles and purposes of our Organization. You may be assured of the support and total co-operation of my country in your discharge of your difficult and lofty task.We also extend our congratulations to your predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  who guided the work of the fortieth session of the General Assembly with a competence equaled only by his rich experience in the United Nations and his perfect knowledge of international affairs.In the past year the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar   has admirably discharged his many responsibilities. We congratulate him warmly and urge him to continue the courageous  bold action to which we have become accustomed since the beginning of his term of office. His report on the work of the Organization clearly reflects his determination to work towards solving the serious problems facing the world  through universal respect for the values which underpin the work of the United Nations and through observance for the principles and norms that govern relations among States.The danger of widespread confrontation that could bring about the extinction of mankind long ago left the realm of fiction. It is rather a tragic aspect of our daily lives. In fact  never in the history of mankind and of international relations has the question of the maintenance of international peace and security been so urgent and vital as it is today. The declaration by the United Nations of the International Year of Peace bears witness to the special urgency of this question on the threshold of the twenty-first century. This situation is diverting the attention of the international community from the true stakes*  development and international co-operation.At a time when the world economy is in turmoil and the majority of countriesare engulfed in an unprecedented economic recession which hampers any true possibility for economic and social progress  the arms race continues to break alarming new records both in terms of the enormous quantities of material and technological resources it absorbs and in terms of the increased quantity and destructive capability of the highly sophisticated weapons to which it gives rise.In this context the urgent implementation of meaningful disarmament measures cannot be considered a purely moral issue  but rather as a necessity on which the future of mankind depends. A new summit conference between the United States ofAmerica and the Soviet Union could contribute to true international detente and to conditions conducive to a climate of trust and dialog between the two super-Powers> this could footer the process of general and complete disarmament.The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations gave us the opportunity to consider the Organizational  accomplishments  difficulties and operations and to make a critical evaluation of them. It demonstrated the readiness of all Member States to work towards the continued strengthening of the tole of the United Nations and of its efforts for peace  security and development.The present delicate and decisive stage in the life of the United Nations gives rise to grave concern because of the threat to the very existence of the Organization. Joint measures must be taken as a matter of urgency to reverse the negative trends and give new momentum to the activities of the United Nations. If such measures are correctly applied  they can only strengthen the vitality of the Organization and better equip it to overcome the present crisis.Yet that approach does not absolve us from the need to assess the situation and act prudently and objectively. We must avoid initiatives which could weaken the Organization's capacity to act and its role as an exemplary instrument of multilateralism and international co-operation.The financial situation must be improved  and we must make the necessary changes and adaptations both in the structure and operations of the United Nations machine. We must rationalize procedures in order to make the best of the human  material and technical potential available to the Organization  for the Organization's ability to adapt and adjust itself to the realities of the day is among its prime attributes  which explains the Organization's ability to have withstood the tribulations of history during its forty years of existence while Preserving the very essence of its universal and universalist vocation. The United Nations has thus been able to withstand the vicissitudes of its history.The General Assembly is once again to consider the same gamut of questions  of conflicts and of crises it has considered in past sessions. Very little progress has been made in the settlement of the main problem facing the international community.The world economic situation shows no sign of recovery  and the gap between developed and developing countries continues to widen  to the great detriment of the latter group. The real chances for economic growth by developing countries -particularly the least developed countries - are growing worse. As their indebtedness increases  their purchasing power decreases and their exports are declining both in quantity and in value.The countries of the third world are faced with a growing disparity between their socio-economic development and their ability to respond satisfactorily to its needs. This exacerbates the already difficult conditions in which development efforts are undertaken  often at the cost of enormous sacrifices on the part of their peoples.The problem of indebtedness - particularly the level of debt servicing - is an unbearable burden for the economies of the developing countries. If it is not lightened  that burden will without doubt crush those economies  which  in the long term  would have repercussions for the developed countries themselves.It is clear that under such circumstances the perpetuation of certain factors - such as deteriorating terms of trade  protectionism  declining multilateralism  decreasing commodity prices  high interest rates  and increased insolvency of debtor countries - cannot serve to promote a new trend in international economic  relations  especially since global negotiations on development issues remain a pious wish.It is important in this context that special attention be given in the framework of the United Nations to the related matters of currency  finance  trade  indebtedness and development. We hope that the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will provide a suitable forum for promoting joint action to launch a program of world recovery.The special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa was undoubtedly a milestone in the history of North-South relations. It will prove to have demonstrated the advantages of regional dialog in the quest for solutions to common problems of development.In addition  that special session was the best opportunity for the international community to demonstrate its genuine solidarity. None the less  the measures adopted there require appropriate follow up so that the endogenous efforts of the African countries can be given the needed international support for the implementation of the program of Action adopted at the conclusion of that important session.As I have said  the same range of questions remains of concern to the international community. The agenda of this session in fact reflects the repetitive nature of the deliberations in the General Assembly at the same time as it indicates how little progress has been achieved in eliminating the tension and conflicts that jeopardize world peace and stability.Many reasons or pretexts are often adduced to justify the perpetuation of certain crises or the emergence of new conflicts. The real cause of the existence of these crises is non-respect for the principles contained in the Charter and rules of conduct that are internationally accepted and stem from the status of membership in the united Nations.As representatives know  no problem can be resolved in a lasting way by following automatic responses. The will of all the parties concerned to find an equitable solution to a given problem is always necessary and constitutes an essential element in the planning and development of adequate responses. That is why neither declarations of intent devoid of practical content  nor radical stands based on dogmatism and open confrontation  can make it easier to find the desired solutions in a world where reason must prevail over force.We believe that if every Member of the united Nations were to respect fully the principles and norms solemnly undertaken and if all Members were firmly committed to defending the Charter objectives there would be no insoluble problems permanent tension or inevitable conflicts. There would be neither interference in matters within the sovereign jurisdiction of States nor attempts at domination  destabilization  aggression and occupation. The South African people would not be suffering from the odious system of apartheid  and Namibia would be independent. The States neighboring on South Africa would not be victims of constant acts of aggression and destabilization and  above all  those acts would not go unpunished  as is now the case.Chad would be free from foreign interference and national reconciliation would already be a reality.The Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PIO)   would have recovered its inalienable rights to independence and the establishment of its own State. Israel's policy of aggression and occupation against the Arab States of the region would have already received a well-deserved response from the international community.If the principles of the Charter and international legality were respected  as I was saying  Lebanon and Cyprus would not see their national independence and territorial integrity threatened. The fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq could have been avoided and peace in the Mediterranean and Gulf regions could have been strengthened.In Central America every State  in sovereignty and without foreign interference  would be exercising its right to choose its own political and economic systems  and the commendable efforts and initiatives of the Contadora Group would today have the support of all the States of the region  thus contributing to the establishment of a lasting peace in that part of the world.South Asia would not be an arena of the dangerous conflicts and tension that exist there at present  and the Khmer and Afghan peoples would be living in peace. The Korean people would be able  in harmony and independence  to meet its aspirations for the peaceful reunification of its homeland and fully play its role within the international community.The peoples of the Western Sahara and East Timor would at last take their rightful place in the community of free and independent nations; and the peoples oE other territories still under foreign domination would also be masters of their own destiny.The mission of peace and good-offices undertaken by the Secretary-General in the quest for peaceful and negotiated solutions to the many problems of the present day would also be given real and sincere support by the parties concerned and the rest of the international community.In that connection  as concerns Western Sahara  the action undertaken by the United Nations Secretary-General  together with the President of Senegal  Mr . Abdou Diouf  seems bo have provided some encouragement in the process of finding a definitive solution to the conflict prevailing in that part of Africa. Me encourage the continuation of that action and are convinced that the present Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  Mr. Denis Sassou N'Guesso  will spare no effort in that direction.The convening this year of the International Conference on Sanctions Against Racist South Africa  the International Conference on the Immediate Independence of Namibia and the fourteenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to the question of Namibia demonstrate how concerned the international community is at the explosive situation in southern Africa.There is undoubtedly some unanimity in recognizing in apartheid the fundamental cause of the tension  instability and conflicts in that tormented region of the African continent. None the less  it is regrettable that the same is not the case in respect of compelling  by the application of vigorous measures  the racist South African regime to put an end to its policy of apartheid. The hesitant attitude of certain countries  towards that policy  together with the absence of concerted and effective action at the international level  has in fact given reassurances to the South African Government in its bellicose behavior.Constant incursions by South African forces into front-line States  in particular Angola and Mozambique  and Pretoria's obstinate refusal to comply with United Nations resolutions and decisions on the independence of Namibia - Security Council resolution 435 (1978) in particular - are the clearest demonstration of the lack of will on the part of the South African regime to accept a peaceful settlement to the problems that it has itself created in southern Africa.We are pleased to note the progress registered in the struggle of the patriotic forces against apartheid and the occupation of Namibia  the struggle of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in particular. The inter national community is duty bound to intensify its moral  political  diplomatic and material support needed in order to achieve the complete liberation of southern Africa from racism and colonial domination.The complex problems of an increasingly interdependent world can be resolved only through effective multilateral action. This assertion by the Secretary-General  contained in his most recent report  indicates in our view the priority task incumbent upon the international community in the period before the next millennium*  in other words  to strengthen the basis of multilateralism  through the strengthening of the United Nations in particular  and to found co-operation among States on universal respect for the norms of international law. The Non-Aligned Movement firmly underscored that need and in the important documents adopted at Harare indicated ways and means of meeting it.The precarious nature of the international political and economic situation impels us to adopt an approach in keeping with the imperatives of the growing interdependence and interaction of the contemporary world.We are confident that mankind  united for better or for worse in the dialectic of human existence and inspired by the valuable lessons of an era rich in sublime moments but also in tragic events  will cross the threshold of the twenty-first century with wisdom and assurance."
"56",2763,"GNQ",41,1986,"I am honored and proud to express  on behalf of His ExcellencyMr. Cbiang Nguema Mbasogo  President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  our warm congratulations to Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury of Bangladesh on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-first session. His election to that important post is seen by the people of Equatorial Guinea as recognition of his personal qualities and accomplishments and as a well-deserved tribute to the role and prestige of Bangladesh  his country  in international affairs.As is traditional  I congratulate his predecessor. Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  on the able and experienced manner in which he presided over the General Assembly at its forty-first session and at the special session on the critical economic situation of our continent  Africa. His impartiality and firm dedication commanded the admiration and praise of the whole international community.I wish also to express the appreciation of the Government and people of Equatorial Guinea of the constant efforts in the sphere of international relationsmade by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in favor of peace; his role as mediator in the dispute between New Zealand and France; and his role in the separate negotiations between the parties to the Western Sahara dispute to establish a cease-fire and organize a referendum there  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African unity and the United Nations.When we proclaimed 1986 the International Year of Peace  we were guided by the conviction that the promotion of international peace and security required a serious commitment by States to take resolute action in favor of the non-use of force  the solution of disputes by peaceful means  non-interference in the internal affairs of others  disarmament  decolonization and the elimination of all forms of discrimination. Similarly  the promotion of peace involves a collective  sustained effort to promote development. Tb that end  there have been many public events throughout the world  which have made it possible to sensitize world public opinion to the urgent need for thought and for systematic  innovative action to achieve the goals set by the United Nations. But we must recognize that the international scene is still  as in past years  giving cause for concern  owing to the persistence of many hotbeds of tension  the worsening of certain conflicts  the widening of differences between the rich and poor nations and the continuation of the unchecked arms race.Equatorial Guinea reiterates its appeal to the international community to try once again to see that the dialog between the super-Powers prospers and that the forums for understanding intensify their work. We harbor the hope that the desirable strengthening of a climate of dialog and greater trust in international relations will lead in a relatively short time to a drastic reduction of nuclear arsenals  a complete ban on chemical weapons  the halting of the arms race and significant advances in conventional disarmament. We are encouraged that following a period of alienation and uncertainty we now see a prospect of understanding between the great Powers.The international economic situation remains a source of concern and gives rise to uncertainties. This has serious consequences for the future. The growth of production in world trade has slowed considerably. The developing countries in particular are still confronting exceptionally difficult circumstances. The machinery of international co-operation  which could have helped to mitigate these problems  has to a great extent become ineffective. The developing countries are urged to undertake drastic adjustments in the unfavorable international economic system. Their efforts are obstructed by a sharpening of protectionist barriers> a sharp economic decline and an ever more intolerable debt burden. International trade  which has been an important instrument for development in the past and an effective channel to guarantee the mutual benefit of all nations  has been blocked  mainly by the growing trend towards protectionism. These adverse factors  together with a grave shrinking of financial flows  an alarming increase in the debt-servicing burden and monetary instability have led to the ironic phenomenon of the reverse transfer of resources from the developing countries to the developed.The international economic system remains characterized by structural imbalances and therefore it is the economically weak countries that have to bear the weight of world-wide economic setbacks and are the ones that suffer the most. Their vulnerable economies are subjected to downward adjustments  which has a critical effect on their development process.It is in that context that the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is considering the start of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations in Punta del Este  Uruguay  as the beginning of concerted efforts to reverse the trend of erosion in the international trade system. The new round should also give us an opportunity to make international trade more free.Five months ago  here in the United Nations  a special session of the General Assembly was held on the critical economic situation in Africa. That was the first occasion in the history of our Organization when a session of that type had been held for the exclusive consideration of the problems of a given region: our continent. The special session made it possible to discuss and examine in detail the level and scope of the economic crisis which is afflicting our continent. The adoption of the United Nations Program of Action for the Economic Recovery and Development of Africa for the coming five years is a symbol of firm political support by the international community to Africa in its adjustment and development efforts within the framework of its Priority Program for Economic Recovery 1986-1990. None the less  in spite of the fact that that special session commanded an encouraging consensus in adopting a Program of Action  that unanimous support was not immediately followed by concrete financing offers. We hope that the international community will make efforts to mobilize resources and set that recovery Program under way.As we have stated from this rostrum on many occasions  the Government of Equatorial Guinea  on the basis of changes that took place in the country in August 1979  has successfully carried out the difficult but noble task of restoring  in accordance with our basic laws  the executive  legislative and judicial powers. It has achieved considerable progress in the social and political spheres. The peace and tranquility prevailing in the country bear witness to that.Unfortunately  and despite the efforts the Government is unceasingly making  the economic situation in my country  which is only a consequence of the situation inherited from an earlier period and the widespread world crisis  still has many obstacles to overcome  since Equatorial Guinea  as a devastated  underdevelopedand least developed country  immediately feels the harmful effects of that world crisis. Nevertheless  in the context of the work done by my Government to create a solid basis for sound economic recovery  for the rehabilitation and development of the country  negotiations at the level of our subregion in Central Africa have been carried out successfully  with the result that Equatorial Guinea has joined the Economic and Customs Union of the Central African States. Likewise  the President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has signed the treaty of admission for our country as a member of the Bank of the Central African states. We believe that with this process our national efforts join together with those of the subregion in our shared struggle against the underdevelopment  hunger and poverty which afflict our populations. It is in the framework of this effort to rehabilitate and develop in my country that I take the opportunity to express my Government's gratitude for the aid and support that friendly countries and international organizations have always given to the Republic of Equatorial Guinea since 3 August 1979; and  given the long road ahead of us  we are confident and hopeful that that assistance will be broadened and diversified  on the basis of resolution 38/224 adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 1983.As we are holding this forty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations the economic situation of the overwhelming majority of States Members of this great family is becoming increasingly critical and solutions to emerge from the crisis are ever more distant  since the imbalance now characterizing international relations still persists. If some improvements are recorded in the political  social and cultural spheres  the influence of ideological blocs and so-called strategic interests and the selective protection of human rights based on criteria that do not take into account the specific characteristics of countries and peoples  prompts us to draw the overall conclusionthat negotiations aimed at redressing imbalances and unfairness are in a state of stagnation. The Summit Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity held at Lagos in 1980  the New Delhi Declaration of the Non-Aligned Movement dated 1983  the intense activities of the Group of 77  the proposals by the 11 Latin American countries for the solution of the foreign-debt problem - to mention just a few - are initiatives that should meet with a response from the developed countries in order to co-operate in such a way as to make it possible for a fair exchange to take place between North and South  because it must be accepted that the growth and stability of the North are related to the speedy development of the South. The worsening of the international economic crisis emphasizes the urgent need to apply in relations among States the principles of the United Nations Charter  bearing in mind the interdependence of trade. The constant increase in the balance-of-payment deficits of the underdeveloped countries and the increase in their foreign debt must lead to fair prices being paid for the raw materials they produce  as well as to the establishment of appropriate measures to make it possible not only for the rich to be further enriched but also for the economic conditions of poor countries to improve considerably.We hope that the resolutions and recommendations of an economic nature which will be adopted at this session of the General Assembly will not only confirm the need for the objectives of the poorer countries to be met but also lead to a practical and positive reaction which will guarantee that such a contribution will be made. At the same time  the international financial organizations should contribute  as an example  to the attainment of those objectives. In keeping with the constant efforts of the Government of Equatorial Guinea to democratize the country  the House of People's Representatives  at its regular session from 10 to 17 April 1985  adopted an agreement requesting that the Government create and institutionalize of a political organization. In implementation of the plan of action of the Economical and Social Council of the United Nations  in accordance with resolutions 1982/36  1983/35  1984/36 and 1984/51  on 4 July 1986 it adopted Law No. 7/1986 on political parties in our country. Since the adoption by referendum  on 15 August 1982  of a new Constitution clearly establishing the system of separation of powers  the process of democratization in Equatorial Guinea that began on 3 August 1979 has remained incomplete because so far our country has lacked any political organization capable of assuming the functions reserved by political science to a country's political party.Although it does not prohibit a Western system of pluralism  the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  like other African countries of the region with which we are waging a joint struggle to achieve development in accordance with our political  economic and socio-cultural characteristics  must  until our experience and level of development warrant the contrary  adopt a political organization within a unified system.My delegation is deeply concerned at the wave of terrorist attacks throughout the world in recent years. It is regrettable that such acts should persist in spite of the efforts made by the international community to prevent them. Terrorism affects human lives  without distinction as to nationality or race  threatens relations of friendship and co-operation between States and jeopardizes international peace and security. Equatorial Guinea is firmly convinced that terrorism has no legal justification and that it can never be acceptable.Another major threat to mankind is the existence of the drug problem. The danger caused by the unlawful use of drugs is giving rise to ever greater alarm. We must unite our efforts and do everything in our power to reduce and eventually eradicate the threat which this scourge poses to our families and peoples. My delegation expresses its profound concern at the growing danger of the unlawful use of and illicit traffic in drugs. At the national level our country is exerting tireless efforts and adopting firm and effective measures to root out this evil.We believe that were it not for the racist regime established in South Africa that country's multiracial population would have found channels of understanding and peaceful coexistence within an atmosphere of equality. Realism and sincere commitment to human rights demand that the still-reluctant Western Powers join the international community in applying the measures needed to eradicate all traces of the abhorrent policy of apartheid. Prom 16 to 20 June  the international community took a unanimous stand on the situation in southern Africa. The Security Council must now adopt mandatory resolutions reflecting the will of the vast majority of the world's countries  thereby fulfilling the basic and historic responsibility for international peace and security vested in it by the United Nations Charter.Our Organization must define a Program of assistance to the front-line countries and to the brave constants of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAFO) in keeping with the international community's duty to those fighting for their freedom.Equatorial Guinea reiterates its position that South Africa's presence in Namibia  being illegal  must be ended. We reaffirm our support for SWAPO and repeat that conditions and situations unrelated to the ^territory of Namibia must not be allowed to affect or delay Namibia's accession to independence.The Republic of Equatorial Guinea hopes that the wisdom and spirit of African solidarity will make it possible for the various Governments that control thecontinent's destiny to preserve the Organization of African Unity (OAU) from attempts to destroy it.Equatorial Guinea expresses the hope that  within the Security Council  a preparatory committee will be set up to carry out the preliminary work for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East. Nevertheless  it is also necessary and appropriate for the parties to the Israeli-Lebanese conflict  as rational human beings  to attempt to put an end to that tragic situation through dialog and negotiation in a spirit free of pride and passion and on the basis of realism  in keeping with the right of the Palestinian people to create their own State in the region  the right of Israel to exist within legal and secure borders and the right of Lebanon to regain its sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence.Since the outbreak of the war between Iran and Iraq  sister countries fated to live for ever in close proximity  Equatorial Guinea has urged them to put an end to that senseless fratricide. We urge all the peoples of the world to seek ways of persuading the warring parties to reach a peaceful settlement.One Member of our Organization  Kampuchea  is new the arena of violence because of the presence of foreign forces on its soil. We reaffirm our solidarity and support for the proposal that guarantees the return of all the Kampuchean refugees now in neighboring countries and a peaceful solution that can ensure respect for the national independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity not only of Kampuchea but of all the countries of the region.We are extremely concerned at the tense situation in Central America and urge all the parties involved to use dialog to find peaceful solutions to their disputes. We encourage the efforts of the Contadora Group to find a peaceful  equitable solution to the conflict in Central America  a region with which Equatorial Guinea has cultural and historical ties. We hope that the initiatives of the Contadora Group will lead to an overall solution of the problem and restore peace and security to that region.In Afghanistan there have been no signs of preservation of that country's sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence notwithstanding the international community's insistence that only the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan can guarantee the Afghan people their inalienable right to self-determination and to choose the economic and political system most conducive to their interests  free from foreign interference or influence. The efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to find a peaceful solution that will facilitate the return of the Afghan refugees to their homeland should therefore be supported in order to establish guidelines for the restoration of peace and tranquility in Afghanistan  as well as in neighboring countries that are also victims of the situation new prevailing in the region of South-West Asia.The tragedy of Cyprus has persisted for many years and there appears to be no shortage of intermediaries or settlement plans. Although all sorts of alternatives have been advanced  the proposal to resolve the Cyprus problem at an international conference sponsored by the United Nations remains stubbornly shelved.The Mediterranean must not be allowed to become a trouble spot where the bludgeon of neo-globalism is brandished  a bludgeon sometimes used without thought of the consequences  as in many cases with which we are familiar.We support the unification of the Korean Peninsula and invite the leaders of the respective Governments to create conditions conducive to the resumption of negotiations  which we hope will lead to a successful conclusion for the entire Korean people. Third countries should work to achieve that peaceful reunification  so that Korea can take its rightful place in the concert of nations.Since 1945 mankind has felt the need to unite in international co-operation designed to save future generations from the scourge of war  and we believe there is a need to reaffirm and strictly observe the principles set forth in our Organization's Charter.This world is for all of us  and we can hardly find another like it in some other part of the universe. It is man who makes life enjoyable. But how can that same man rob his fellow man of what cannot be given as a gift? I am referring to life  that indescribable treasure that the frantic arms race is threatening with extinction. To protect lives that cannot exceed 130 years - the lives of human beings - we are embarking on unthinkable and inhuman practices that threaten the future of coming generations. Let us be reasonable with that future."
"57",2809,"GRC",41,1986,"I should like  at the outset. Sir  to offer you my delegation's warmest congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly. Although our two countries are geographically far apart they nevertheless maintain close ties and sincere friendship. Your wide experience is the best guarantee that you will successfully deal with difficulties which might arise and that you will guide the work of this Assembly in the most effective way.The Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom  speaking on behalf of the 12 member States of the European Community  has presented the Community's position on various important international issues. Greece  obviously  fully shares these views. I shall therefore confine my statement to my Government's position on major world issues as well as on those which are of particular interest to Greece. A more detailed presentation of the Greek views is included in the text of my statement.Last year we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of our Organization. Much was heard cm that occasion of the ability of the United Nations to contribute effectively in dealing with the multiple problems facing our world today. At the same time all speakers stated their intention to contribute effectively to that purpose. Unfortunately  the festive atmosphere was marred by the fact that the Member States were not able to agree on the text of a common declaration. It is a matter of regret that national considerations proved to be stronger than the effort to reaffirm the purposes and principles of this Organization.This year we are observing another significant occasion  namely  the twenty-fifth anniversary of the creation of the Nan-Aligned Movement  which since its foundation has played a significant role on the international scene. The Prime Minister of Greece  in his congratulatory message to the new Chairman of the Movement  Prime Minister Mugabe of Zimbabwe  stated: ""Greece particularly appreciates the role of the Non-Aligned Movement in international affairs and acknowledges its important contribution to the strengthening of world peace  stability and development and to the promotion of international detente."" It was a pleasure and an honor for my Government to be asked to participate as a guest  for the first time  in such an important world event as the Harare Summit Conference. That invitation reflects the excellent relations we enjoy with the members of the Non-Aligned Movement  relations we wish to promote even further.During the year that has elapsed no significant development was marked on the major issues our Organization is dealing with. We have observed with pleasure  however  that the two super-Powers have broadened the areas of their dialog with the prospect that these contacts may culminate in a high-level meeting whose realization and success we all wish for. We are fully aware that peace on earth depends to a large extent cm the quality of the relations between the two super-Powers.International security and disarmament constitute two major goals of our foreign policy. In a spirit of collective responsibility for world peace  the Greek Prime Minister  Mr. Papandreou  together with the leaders of the States which participate in the initiative of the Six  has continued the efforts for nuclear disarmament. The Declaration of Mexico recently adopted in Ixtapa  calling again upon the two super-Powers to cease nuclear tests as well as the production and development of all nuclear weapons and to avoid their deployment in space  reflects the agonizing concern of our peoples cm the eventuality of a nuclear holocaust.As far as nuclear weapons are concerned Greece supports their gradual and mutual reduction by both alliances  to the lowest possible level. The complete abolition of nuclear weapons remains for us the immutable ultimate goal.  the question of a balanced reduction of conventional arms should be dealt with. In the search for principles which could strengthen international security we should not lose sight of the close relationship between nuclear and conventional weapons. We believe that on these issues viable agreements could be readied  the implementation of which could be monitored through an effective verification system. May I at this point welcome the positive outcome of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  which we hope will contribute to diminishing the danger of war between the two blocs.I should like also to stress that the Greek Government attaches great importance to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.The improvement of the political atmosphere  both regionally and internationally  the renunciation of violence as a means to resolve differences and the development of a wide sense of security are  of course  prerequisites for the abolition of arms systems  particularly those of nuclear weapons.It would be remiss of me if I did not refer  at this point  to the consequences of disarmament on economic development  particularly in a world with limited natural resources.My Government is equally interested in promoting the idea of the creation of nuclear-free zones. We have consistently supported the proposal to make the Balkans a zone free of nuclear and chemical weapons.At this point I should like to refer to the concern of the Greek Government arising from the growing proliferation and use of chemical weapons  in contravention of existing international rules. We believe that the international community should set amongst its priorities a complete ban on the production and use of chemical weapons as well as the destruction of existing stockpiles.It is only natural that ray Government attaches particular importance to the sensitive area o£ the Mediterranean. Greece  a Mediterranean country with an ancient tradition  considers developments in the Mediterranean as critical  not only for international relations but more specifically for reasons pertaining to its own security. We have therefore sincerely and consistently supported all genuine efforts to promote peace in the area  not only for the benefit of the Mediterranean peoples but also for the sake of world stability. We look fx ward to seeing the Mediterranean become an area of peace  friendship and co-operation among its peoples.Within the context of problems of wider significance which transcend the limits of regional relationships  the case of human rights and fundamental freedoms should be stressed  as well as the need to promote social  economic and cultural rights. We are unswervingly convinced that strict compliance with the international rules adopted in this respect is an obligation of States  not merely an option.The Greek Government has also repeatedly declared its commitment to the improvement of the status of women  aiming at the total eradication of discrimination based on sex  at the national  regional and international levels. We therefore attach particular importance to the implementation of the strategies adopted at the Nairobi Conference.Let me now turn to the problem of terrorism  which has become a present-day drama. My country is situated in a geographical region where international problems have remained unresolved for decades  creating a psychology of desperation. Greece has been particularly afflicted by acts of terrorism  despite its efforts  within its means  to prevent then. We have repeatedly and unequivocally condemned terrorism and adhere to international treaties aimed at combating it. The peace-loving Greek people abhor actions which can harm innocent people. The consensus achieved in the United Nations with the adoption of General Assembly resolution 40/61 should be used to this effect. I would also like at this point to stress that one should not combat terrorism with illegal acts. Otherwise we alter into a vicious circle leading to a dangerous escalation.There are  unfortunately  a number of subjects with which our Organization has repeatedly dealt  without any progress towards their resolution.The situation in southern Africa remains explosive  with unforeseen consequences for peace  security and the stability in the area. Its prolongation entails broader repercussions on international relations.Greece watches with particular interest developments in the area  not wily because of the overall impact of the problem  but also because a sizable Greek community lives in South Africa.The recent grave deterioration of the situation in South Africa  together with the failure of the well-known mediation efforts of the missions of the Commonwealth and the European Community render prospects highly unfavorable. There is obviously no intention on the part of the South African Government to abolish the abhorrent apartheid system  which Greece has repeatedly  consistently and firmly condemned.I would also like to strongly condemn once again the military interventions of South Africa against its neighboring countries. Greece expresses its unequivocal solidarity with the front-line States  which should receive full international support in order successfully to cope with the threat against them.Unfortunately  the problem of Namibia is also in a complete deadlock. South Africa continues the illegal occupation of the Territory and refuses to proceed to the immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia  which we consider as the sole internationally accepted basis for a peaceful solution of the problem.My Government follows with great attention the developments in the region of the Middle East. Last year  from this very rostrum  I stressed the principles guiding our policy with respect to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Allow me to reiterate them  since it has not been possible  during this past year  to promote the peace process effectively despite a degree of movement.The withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the Arab territories occupied in 1967 is the basic prerequisite for the peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem. This occupation has been repeatedly deplored by the international community through numerous resolutions of the United Nations  which  unfortunately  have not been implemented. We support the fundamental and inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination   including their right to create their own State. At the same time we fully support the right of Israel to exist within secure  internationally recognized borders. We believe that it is only through negotiations that a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement of the dispute can be reached. These negotiations should therefore start without further delay  with the participation of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) which  as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  has a significant role to play in the peace process.an international conference could offer much to this effect. It is  however  difficult to imagine how such a process could start in a climate marked by tension and efforts to impose faits accomplis. As in the case of Cyprus  we reject the policy of faits accomplis and of unilateral measures  as well as any attempts at altering the demographic and geographical conditions in the occupied territories. Such actions are contrary to international law and undermine the prospects for peace. For reasons related to the religious tradition  we attach particular importance to the status of Jerusalem.In Lebanon  the recurrence of the crisis and the repeated acts of violence take us farther away from the goal to which all interested parties  as well as those who exercise influence  naturally aspire0  that is to say  to the re-establishment of the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon. We also call upon all parties to assist the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  so that it can fulfill the highly important task for which it has been established.The war between Iran and Iraq has now been going on for six years  bringing destruction to both sides. My country  because of its friendly relations with both parties  calls upon them to demonstrate a conciliatory spirit so that hostilities might cease and negotiations start within the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.The situation in Central America continues  unfortunately  to remain tense. Greece is not the only country which has stressed that the problems of the area  problems deep-rooted in the past  cannot be dealt with  let alone be solved  except through peaceful procedures. My Government sincerely regrets that despite the help offered by the Group of Support  the Contadora process has not yet produced the expected results. We still hope that it might do so and continue to fully support it.The courageous efforts of many Latin American governments to find a solution to the long-lasting problems of their countries should be particularly praised. We wish that the democratization process in those South American countries which still lack democratic institutions will be expedited. We are therefore irritated by the recent deterioration in Chile of an already intolerable situation of suppression of political freedoms and human rights. We condemn the barbarous methods of the military dictatorship and express our solidarity with the people of Chile.Greece  as I have already mentioned  has consistently condemned all cases of invasion and occupation of countries by third Powers  as well as the policy of fa its accomplis. we adopt the same position regarding the situation which persists in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  bringing great hardship to the peoples of those countries. We firmly consider that the foreign troops which are in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea should withdraw fully  as soon as possible  according to the resolutions of the United Nations.The area of the Balkans is  for obvious reasons  one of vital interest forGreece. A long tradition determines the constants in the relations between the Balkan countries. Therefore  my Government has undertaken all efforts in order to improve relations with our neighboring countries as well as the overall political climate in the Balkans. We have noted with satisfaction that our endeavors have yielded positive results in all cases save one. Though self-evident  it is worthwhile stressing once again that where mutual respect exist:  where the claims are raised  where established sovereign rights are not questioned  then all peoples  even those which in the past were split by long-standing and deep differences  can easily find the road to co-operation and friendship.In my speech I touched upon certain major international issues. Allow me now to expand on the question of Cyprus. It is of the utmost concern to my Government  not only because it is a major international problem  but also for historical  national and cultural reasons  since 80 per cent of the island's population are Cypriot citizens of Greek origin who share the Hellenic heritage.Furthermore  apart from its special relationship with the Republic of Cyprus  my country is also one of its guarantor Powers. Therefore  our interest in developments in Cyprus  and more particularly in the illegal presence of the Turkish army there  is particularly strong.The question of Cyprus is one of those rare international problems on which the world community has expressed itself practically unanimously  not only on how it should be resolved but also on what specific arrangements should be included in any solution  I would refer  indicatively  to General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX)  Security Council resolution 365 (1974) and paragraph 7 of General Assembly resolution 37/253  according to which:""The General Assembly ... considers the withdrawal of all occupation forces from the Republic of Cyprus as an essential basis for a speedy and mutually acceptable solution of the problem of Cyprus"". That statement is crystal clear and unambiguous. The question of Cyprus is a problem arising from invasion and continuing military occupation. Therefore  the withdrawal of the Turkish troops constitutes a necessary prerequisite for any solution. I would point out that very recently the summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Harare reiterated that all foreign troops and Turkish settlers  who already number more than 60 000  should leave Cyprus as an unconditional pre-condition of a solution.We are firmly convinced that a just and viable solution of the Cyprus question presupposes the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from the territory of the Republic of Cyprus before any new constitution enters into force. Such a solution should also provide for a system of international guarantees  non-military in character  which should preclude the possibility of unilateral intervention  so that the security of the people of Cyprus in its entirety is effectively assured.I shall not elaborate on the details of the latest initiative of the Secretary-General  both because that falls within the competence of the President of Cyprus and because the facts are more or less well known to all. I should simply like to stress that the draft framework agreement presented by the Secretary-General covers exhaustively all the constitutional aspects of the problem  practically to the sole benefit of the Turkish side. At the same time  the questions of the withdrawal of foreign troops  guarantees and the so-called three freedoms  that is to say  the main elements of the Cyprus problem  subjects of vital interest to the Greek Cypriots  are relegated to vague and uncertain future procedures. Let me point out in this respect that the Turkish side has cynically declared that under any solution part of the Turkish Army would remain in Cyprus and that Ankara would insist upon a system of guarantees which would give it the right to unilateral military intervention. It is therefore obvious that the framework agreement is one-sided and incomplete. It is inconceivable that one could evaluate  let alone make comments on  that draft without first hearing  officially  the position of the Turkish side on the questions of the withdrawal of the Turkish troops  the guarantees  the three freedoms and the Turkish settlers. In view of that situation. President Kyprianou submitted his well-known proposals of 10 June  whose substance is that these pending points should be discussed as a matter of priority before he would be able to take any position whatsoever regarding the draft framework agreement.My Government fully and strongly supports this position taken by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus  which is entirely rational  constructive and fair. We believe that these proposals of the President of the Republic of Cyprus include all the elements which would guarantee progress without prejudice to the vital interests of any side.Any overview of international affairs would be incomplete without a reference to economic problems.In 1986 a number of important developments took place on the international economic scene. They ranged from the fall in the price of oil and lower interest rates to changes in perceptions with regard to the formulation of the economic policy at a global level.Within the framework of international efforts to resolve the external debt problem of developing countries we have consistently supported the significant initiative undertaken in 1985 at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We follow with keen interest the evolution of the issue. None the less we are concerned by the slow pace of progress.I should also like to refer to the question of world trade: Its development  the reduction of protectionism and joint entrepreneurial activity constitute one of the most secure means of rapprochement and understanding between States with different points of view and political systems. I hope that the recent Ministerial Conference at Punta del Este  where the spirit of compromise prevailed  will mark the starting point of a difficult process for the progressive resolution of the complex and multidimensional problem of the liberation of international trade.The international community is called upon to eliminate the persistent imbalances in the world economy through effective multilateral co-operation. The recent special session of the General Assembly on Africa  at a moment when the role of the United Nations is being reviewed  proved once more the importance of international co-operation.Another recent pertinent example of the value of international co-operation within the framework of the United Nations is the Treaty on the Law of the Sea  which was signed in 1982. Greece  as a maritime nation  expresses the hope that it will soon enter into force.During the past year our Organization has been tried by a serious  ongoing economic crisis. This cannot be attributed to a single cause. It is the result of many factors and must be dealt with effectively and substantively to avoid more serious difficulties in the future.Greece actively follows efforts for greater rationalization and streamlining of the finances of the Organization. He have studied with great interest the conclusions and recommendations of the Group of 18 governmental experts. I think we all agree that the Group carried out its task effectively and that its recommendations should be studied with particular attention.Our thanks should also be directed to the Secretary-General  who  with his usual zeal and devotion bo his mission  has worked untiringly in order to deal with the crisis. I should like to express my Government's pleasure at Mr. Perez de Cuellar's complete recovery.It is only natural that we feel frustrated  since for many years the major international problems have continued to appear on the Organization's agenda without any substantial progress being made towards their solution. This disappointment  however  is counterbalanced to a certain extent by the realization that those issues are being discussed by the international community  which we hope will  as time goes by  become all the more conscious of the importance of those issues for humanity's peace  progress and prosperity  all of which are mankind's everlasting wish and eternal aim."
"58",2850,"GRD",41,1986," Permit me. Sir  on behalf of my delegation  to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session and to affirm my Government's confidence in your ability to direct the affairs of this session to constructive and productive conclusions. I would also like to pay a tribute to the fruitful efforts of your predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  and for the impartial  flexible and skillful manner in which he presided over the fortieth session. It is a great joy at this session to see the Secretary-General in his customary position  restored to health and refreshed.I am happy to report continuing progress in my country's political and economic recovery. During the past year we have witnessed the birth of social and political organizations and unrestrained activity in our society. This  of course  speaks well for the democratic society we are endeavoring to restore and to maintain. Our efforts at economic construction  while making steady progress  continue to be restrained by structural and other difficulties. My pe°Pl«'s aspiration to sustained political and social stability is clearly dependent on the success of our economic programs. In this context  I wish to renew our appeal to the international community for additional assistance to complement our domestic efforts at economic revitalization through fiscal and budgetary reform.My delegation recalls the many articulate voices that gave eloquent expression to the principles of the Charter during the session commemorating the fortieth anniversary of our Organization. As we continue the forty-first session  it is my country's hope that the spirit of good will and the utterances of good intentions which characterized the last session will be carried over into the present session and be translated into united and decisive action.Hi tit this in mind  as representatives debate the stubborn issues facing the international community  Many of which seem to appear perennially on the General Assembly's agenda  let us remember that there are many similarities in our apparent diversity and that there are many more issues that unite us than divide us. what better time than this  the International Year of Peace  can there be for Member States to make a fresh start  a new beginning  in the pursuit of a true and lasting peace? In this regard the super-Powers have a solemn duty and heavy responsibility to lead the way in the search for peace in a resolute and sincere manner. First have peace in your heart and then you will be able to give peace to others  in the pursuit of peace we should walk and not be tired  we should run and not be exhausted.The United Nations  in terms of geography  demography  political philosophy  language  culture and attitude  is a microcosm and  as such  has the obligation and the moral authority to plead the cause of peace in this the International Year of Peace  which the General Assembly proclaimed during its commemorative session.The threat of nuclear destruction  which has the effect of making mankind an endangered species  hangs over us as the sword of Damocles. There must he no illusion that huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons offer any valid potential for the attainment and maintenance of international peace. Indeed  the prospects for such peace will be enhance only when nuclear disarmament becomes a fundamental policy concern on the agendas of the super-Powers and the other States now unwittingly engaged in nuclear proliferation. We therefore reiterate the appeal of the international community to those Powers to spare no effort in the quest for a peaceful resolution of all their differences  especially their nuclear rivalry on land  on the sea and in outer space. Too much money is being spent annually developing and perfecting methods of mass destruction. We call upon the Powers concerned to use at least a part of the money currently spent thus to assist in financing the development programs of the underdeveloped countries of the Caribbean  Africa  Asia and the Pacific  and in providing jobs and other opportunities for their underprivileged citizens. I submit that this can be a very significant contribution to world peace  progress and stability. My Government has taken note of apparently positive developments in recent months in disarmament and related negotiations and in East-West relations  and is heartened by them. However  the fact that little significant progress has been made increases our anxiety and compels us to urge - nay  demand - qr eater efforts towards nuclear disarmament and arms reduction. Such efforts must be aimed also at lowering suspicion  building mutual confidence and enlarging the prospect of international peace and security. The Government of Grenada is convinced that educational and cultural exchange affords the easiest  simplest and least expensive method of further international peace. The opportunities available in this area should be fully and rapidly expanded for the common good of mankind. We call upon all States  especially those with different political systems and those with other disputes  to encourage the use of the universal vehicle of culture and to promote bonds of friendship and co-operation among all the peoples of the world.It is generally agreed among members of the international community that the odious  cruel  inhuman and degrading practice of apartheid is unacceptable and indefensible. It is systematized and institutionalized racism and injustice  and has no place in civilized society. It must therefore be dismantled now. There is  however  disagreement as to the strategy and methodology for achieving this  but Grenada supports all efforts and measures designed to assist in attaining that goal. In that context  we join in the demand for the immediate  unconditional release from custody of Nelson Mandela  the distinguished black South African leader  and all the other political prisoners now languishing in South African gaols  and for immediate and meaningful national dialog.The liberation and democratization of South African society is a solemn responsibility of all nations big and small  and we must take concerted action to achieve it without further delay. Grenada believes also that the time has come when we must resort to comprehensive mandatory sanctions in our fight against apartheid  despite the costs inherent in that strategy. I wish to recognize the sterling contribution being made by the Governments and the peoples of the front-line States in the struggle against apartheid and to congratulate them on their heroism in the face of overwhelming odds. How long will the intransigence of the South African Government be allowed to continue  and how long will its inhumanity to the black man be tolerated? The inalienable right of all peoples to independence and self-determination must not bo denied the black majority in South Africa and Namibia  and must not be compromised.I have the permission of my Prime Minister to refer to his fortieth-anniversary statement to the Assembly on IS October W85  when he said  inter alia  that""to satisfy the Charter's high hopes for humanity the United Nations must come to grips with some fundamental realities. Although the world may never bo fully free from instances of injustice  it must certainly be recognized that there can be no lasting peace where injustice is institutionalized. There must  therefore  be ... united action to rid South Africa of the scourge of apartheid and minority rule  and to bring independence to Namibia."" (A/40/PV.35  p. 48-50)For the purpose of clarification and for the avoidance of doubt  I wish to restate and reaffirm ray Government's position on the questions of South Africa and Namibia; Grenada remains unequivocally opposed to the principle of apartheid as a system of government. Grenada remains committed to the international demand for self-determination and independence for the peoples of South Africa and Namibia under majority rule. Grenada remains committed to the dismantling of the apartheid system of government being practiced in South Africa. Grenada will to the extent possible  and consistent with its own policies  support any move or action by the international community designed to bring about the dismantling of apartheid and the achievement of majority rule in South Africa. Grenada believes that comprehensive mandatory sanctions are one of the few effective means of persuasionstill available to the international community and that these should be imposed without delay. Grenada supports the call for the immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners now being held in South Africa's prisons. Grenada will support any resolution or motion calling for the imposition of sanctions or any other measures  provided that such resolution or action is presented in clear and unambiguous terms and deals specifically with the subject matter.In our hemisphere the continued escalation of tension in Central America constitutes a grave threat to international peace and security. The United Nations must therefore monitor the situation and assist in ensuring that it is not allowed to get out of control. Grenada believes that a political solution is the surest way of bringing peace to the region and calls upon all the parties concerned to work for a negotiated settlement of all issues within the framework proposed by the Con tad or a Group.In the Middle East  the Arab-Israeli conflict  the Iran-Iraq war  and the many ancillary issues which inflame and exacerbate passion constitute a grave threat to international peace and security and must be resolved peaceably and equitably through honest bilateral and multilateral means  with the assistance of the international community. The continuing plight of the Bahai community of the region is also a cause for concern  and we must begin to give serious consideration to it.The recent special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa is a cogent example of the value of collective action in dealing with issues of global concern  and the lessons learn therefrom should be used in our efforts to regulate international economic relations and establish measures and guidelines for redressing existing imbalances in favor of a more equitable redistribution of the available economic factors.It is clear that the debt crisis which threatens to undermine economic and social structures in developing countries also has disturbing effects in the financial and governmental circles of the developed world. The dimensions of global economic interdependence should be a potent reminder to the developed countries that they cannot be insulated from the effects of persistent poverty.hunger and negative growth in developing countries. The multilateral system must therefore be utilized in our endeavor to find solutions for these crises.In the same way  our resolve to establish a new system of trade rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade must be pursued vigorously. Adjustment through growth and development depends  among other things  on the terms under which we import and export. It also depends on the productive capacity of our economies and on the adoption of appropriate and responsive policies by international financial institutions. Grenada anticipates and will work towards fundamental reforms in these areas of high priority.The unique factors and problems which characterize small island developing States have been well documented and laid before the international community. Important among these is the inherent  multidimensional issue of vulnerability. Indeed  the economic and political survival of these States turns on the extent to which structural and other factors which constitute that threat are mitigated by endogenous development efforts complemented by special programs of assistance and co-operation. My Government wishes to appeal for greater understanding of the plight of small island developing States and calls for imaginative schemes by United Nations specialized agencies  other multilateral institutions  and donor countries to assist this disadvantaged group of States.Another area of global interest and concern is the illicit trafficking in drugs and dangerous substances which  like a plague  is spreading over the face of the earth and eroding society  endangering the lives of our young people  upon whom the future lies. Concomitant with the craze for those dangerous substances is a proportionate rise in the level of violence  which is fast becoming a seamy subculture in many societies.The escalation of international terrorism  too  gives cause for much concern-  the terrorists grow bolder every day  striking almost at will  bringing terror anddeath to innocent  unsuspecting people everywhere. The peace and security of the world are in danger  and the international community must act swiftly to check and contain this evil and ultimately to defeat and destroy it.The battle against this twin menace is likely to be costly and demanding  and no single nation can on its own undertake it successfully. There is therefore a need for close co-operation among all countries in the development of practical mechanisms for sharing information  for security  and for meeting the costs that will be involved. This august body must take the lead in co-ordinating our efforts and providing the umbrella under which we can all make our contributions towards the final victory.My delegation is convinced that by pursuing the aforementioned consideration  among others  which have a common denominator for all concerned  we can avoid contentious and adversarial postures which impede progress and hinder consensus and unanimity. Indeed  there are many similarities in our apparent diversities. There is much more that unites us than that divides us. The onus is upon us in this exalted forum to identify and accentuate our similarities  while we try honestly and candidly to come to grips with our apparent dissimilarities. International co-operation in a spirit of brotherhood and in an atmosphere of secure and lasting peace is the highest demand of our time  and we must do everything to achieve it."
"59",2897,"GTM",41,1986,"As is the custom among my fellow Guatemalans  I should like to begin by introducing myself. I am Venicio Cerezo  the legitimate representative of the people of Guatemala  a politician  a simple Guatemalan  with all the characteristics found in our indigenous Ladino culture.We are relatively quiet and observant as were our indigenous ancestors  a trait consistent with our varied and mountainous landscape. We are dreamers  reserved by nature - the result of a past of suffering and difficulties. We are patient and indefatigable workers as a result of our magical confidence in a better future. We are stoical in the face of criticism and are always ready to overcome difficulties.But we are firm  convinced of final success  thanks to our love for our land and our historical convictions. We have worked many years to find a non-violent path  a broadening of the political base that would allow the people of Guatemala to elect freely a Government that would be at its service - one chosen by it  which would begin a serious effort to establish a united and participatory democratic society.From the start  we behaved with absolute sincerity and honesty and with total objectivity. Here the surprises began  some of which seemed incomprehensible and others most surprising. An attempt was made to assassinate me for behaving in the way I have just outlined. Several such attempts were made  and I must recognize that even now  I am not sure why none of these was successful - possibly because of a bit of foresight  some luck and much protection from God.But perhaps what surprised me most was the lack of confidence on the part of some democratic countries as that our eventual success  and this naturally had another consequence  which from a political view made things more difficult - that is  we found virtually no concrete support for our search for democracy.This attitude was such that when we managed to succeed  many people were astonished. Eight months later  some still insist that this is all a farce  at the bottom of which lies an agreement between this politician speaking to you and those who were accused of oppressing the people of Guatemala. I understand this feeling of surprise. Those not familiar with the inner strength of Guatemalans do not realize what we are capable of. Even within Guatemala  there are still small elite sectors that refuse to recognize the deep changes taking place.By the grace of God  all that is happening is true. We are living through a true process of democratization. For the first time in 42 years  the President is a politician - a lawyer by profession  a liberal - who reached the presidency with the support of the people and of a party made up of the urban middle class  farm workers and the indigenous people  with the help of neither traditional private entrepreneurs nor the army nor the United States.Of course  this is surprising and almost exceptional in light of our recent history  particularly because the path was peaceful rather than violent. It was not an armed revolution  but rather a popular mobilization at the national level  giving the current President a mandate unprecedented in the political history of the country.But who is the hero of this Guatemalan story that I am now recounting? The true heroes of this story are the people of Guatemala  who knew - as always - how to surpass the expectations of those who would judge them in the light of other realities.Among all the choices available  the various sectors of our society - a society separated by brutal economic differences  divided for cultural and racial reasons  polarized by war and the policy of confrontation and oppressed by electoral fraud and repression  corruption and the inefficiency of elite groups -opted  decided  chose the electoral process  non-violence and participation as a means of deciding its destiny. And  in contrast to similar communities within the region  each sector contributed to the birth of this mere intent to establish a democracy.The people won the right to exercise their sovereignty; the inevitable pundits misjudged the people's capabilities and strength  and scorned their ability to make decisions  but none the less the people decided and voted upon  and now support  not a party or a man  but a democratic process.That is why  when he chose dialog among Guatemalans as a method of government  the President was aligning himself with the poor and the middle class; but he is aware that ultimately the array and the traditional business sectors were able to accept the will of the people.The admission that the people  not the governing elite  is the leading actor in our attempt to implement democracy is a surprising but fundamental premise of any analysis of our situation. Despite all predictions  it was the indigenous people  the illiterate  the farmers  the workers and the middle class that became involved en mass in the election. Contrary to the predictions of the analysts  people were conscientious they opted for change; they committed themselves to democracy; they put aside their frustrations; they overcame their pain at the death of their dear ones; and they embarked upon the building of their own destiny.Among the middle- and lower-income sectors  there was more participation  while in the higher economic groups there was more non-participation and disillusionment. But in general it was established beyond question that we want democracy: a democracy for the illiterate and the peasants; for the middle and professional classes; for the rich and the military; a democracy of our own choosing  and one we hope that all will respect  accept and support.We Guatemalans are tired of suffering; we now live in hope. We consider that we have made our share of sacrifices and that we have the right to continue on our road with serenity  prudence  minimal sacrifice and minimal hatred. But the task is enormous  and that is the story I wish to tell.We found Guatemala in a disastrous state; all the numerical indexes  relating to areas such as hunger  illiteracy and unemployment  were negative. I shall not rehearse the statistics  for I do not wish here to stress our ills or to feel sorry for ourselves in a display of a sort of collective masochism. We know the figures; they are in our files  and they show us what it is we must resolve. But the most complicated and difficult thing to face is that we found a society bereft of institutions  all sectors having lost faith in processes and institutions as a means of settling disputes and making decisions. The middle- and lower-income groups were compelled therefore to repress their most fervent hopes  and the leading elite in all sectors of society had fallen into anarchy or corruption and had become opportunistic.This could have led Guatemala into open war  with unpredictable consequences  but that did not happen. We found the way to peace through democratic participation. It is only fitting that I should acknowledge  first  the people of Guatemala in the middle- and lower-income groups who  despite repression and attempts to cause disillusionment  persisted in their hard  lengthy search for democracy and succeeded in creating conditions for broadening the political base  which was the beginning of this process. I acknowledge also the political leaders of various parties who interpreted correctly the aspirations of the people  rejecting the opportunism of the ruling elite and rejecting the hopelessness caused by repression. I acknowledge  in particular  my party  the Guatemalan Christian Democratic Party  which  even during the worst moments  remained hopeful and kept the way open for a successful conclusion. More than 300 of our democratic comrades gave their lives for democratic change and set an example for the preservation of faith.I acknowledge the new breed of array officers who  in 1982 and 1983  determined to break out of the existing order and contribute to creating the conditions for a political process  avoiding the mistakes of other autocratic Governments of our region which  in their intransigence  led their peoples into constant confrontation.By opting for the poor  for peace and for democracy  the Catholic Church helped maintain hope; it acted wisely in helping the lower-income groups  where it has great influence  in making its choices.In economic sectors known to be traditionalist and conservative  there were leaders who were able to arouse interest in the desirability of a democratic outcome and to initiate a discussion of an option that had been thought to have been rejected.I must  of course  acknowledge the organized popular groups  co-operatives and trade unions. Despite having been among the principal victims  in the main they opted for peaceful participation  interested only in the establishment of a new pluralistic society.Now we must rebuild Guatemala. The facts I have just outlined show why we Guatemalans can say that the decision to rebuild Guatemala through democracy was a collective decision by an entire people  not the work of a successful group of revolutionaries or of a single political party. The task goes beyond the short term. It goes beyond the elections. The basic objective is to replace the repressed and anarchistic society we found with a free  pluralistic  institutionally orderly society  with a view to the welfare of all.In the early period of my administration I am faced with the task of leading the national reconstruction effort; the first problem confronting the nation is the natural impatience of some leading sectors of the country. We have many questions to answer. What should the pace of change be? Whom should change affect? Inwhose favor should it work? in order to answer those and other questions we have decided to use our imagination; we must find our own answers  because today traditional models are in crisis.We have decided on a long-term plan not limited to my presidential term: I am temporarily the leader of the process  but I have decided to co-operate as just another citizen with whoever might be elected by the people later in this great national effort for the benefit of future generations.We want a well organized  participatory society that will serve national interests  not just those of one sector  group or union. We want a society operating and structured to serve the human being - man or woman  indigenous or mestizo - creating appropriate conditions for their fulfillment as individuals.We are serious in our aspirations to such a wonderful society. We are determined to build it; thus far we have overcome all obstacles  and I see no reason why we should not continue to do so. We want a society in which our past will not be the basis for complaints and weeping - we are tired of that - or for shame - for it is  after all  our past - but will rather help us build our own identity and our own future.We want a society in which right and the law prevail; where dissent is possible; where peace will result from awareness of the ability to use institutional machinery rather than force to settle disputes; where natural and human resources will serve the needs of all  not of the few. In essence  we want a democratic society: one not conceived of as a mere instrument for meeting petty interests but one which will provide a way of seeking perfection in human relations.We must redefine democracy. In so doing  we can clearly see that the President of Guatemala has not been elected to preside over a tragedy; rather  he has been elected to be a leader of a people that- wants to be the master of its own destiny.I am here to tell the General Assembly that we have started on the long road that will take us to change. For we believe that changes are a consequence and not the beginning of a process. Therefore  we are undertaking these changes vigorously  step by step  but prudently and patiently.We do not want to take a step backwards; we do not want regression. In rejecting the urgent demands of those who are impatient  those who are opportunists  those who cannot transcend their pain  we are asking our people and the peoples of the world to help us carry our cross - not in order to crucify us but  rather  to bring glory to our efforts  to contribute to the surge of a humanity of light that projects and does not destroy.I ask everyone here to give us credit for our hopes and not to judge us by what we have suffered - because  I repeat  we Guatemalans have already paid the price of suffering.Aware of the decision taken by the Guatemalans  I proposed the method of reaching agreement to determine the strategies and processes of change. This means  as Professor Aristides Calvani said  ""achieving the greatest degree of agreement within disagreement"". It means working to find agreements  points that bring us together  not those that emphasize our differences. It means rejecting traditional dichotomies and learning to live together and to accept each other as we are. It means promoting multiple and diverse ways of thinking.From the outset I saw the difficulty of implementing that method when some intellectuals insisted that agreement through dialog was impossible - as though the world had once and for all rejected the possibilities of reaching agreement.It is true that coming to an agreement requires an act of humanity on the part of leaders; they must admit that they do not possess absolute truth. It requires that the opportunism of the moment be abandoned and replaced by permanent and historical values  it takes courage not to expect immediate recognition but to wait for history to speak. In short  what is required is a sense of strength and the conviction of one's own ideas  so that one is not afraid of confronting the ideas of others. History has consistently shown that reason is not on one side alone  and that human beings do not often want to learn the lessons of history.Personally  I am convinced that our national leaders will be capable of solving this dilemma in favor of long-term interests and not short-term opportunities; of placing the interests of the nation over personal interests  of history over the immediate. And I am absolutely sure that the people will know how to choose - that is  those committed to the interests of all the people and not to their own personal interests.But  in the final analysis  the effort to which we must devote our imagination is towards the promotion of some ideas that are new to our country. In practice  we are trying to combine strategies and techniques that will be useful to the attainment of our objectives. These objectives were laid down in the ""National Plan"" approved by the people in December 1985  when we were elected to govern  in exercise of their legitimate sovereignty. They have already been described in my statement. The strategies to achieve the objectives have been synthesized in three main short-term and medium-term policies. In the spirit of agreement through dialog and of the democracy we wish to build  these policies reject traditional dichotomies  because we do not want to fall into polarization and confrontation; they reject definitions in the framework of an economic model because no such model can be adapted to our reality.Our premise is that technology is only an instrument at the service of political decisions. We believe that man does not live for the economy but  rather  that the economy should be used for the benefit of man. We refuse to reduce the conflicts of the world and of modern society to a mere dilemma of good versus bad men  or to East-West confrontation. We prefer to opt for values and not for positions  and therefor e for pluralistic democracies and not for authoritarian regimes  whatever the type. That is the basis of our three policies.First  there is the social policy  in order to institutionalize democracy.  In this field  the action of the Government is basically aimed at creating the institutional mechanisms to resolve conflicts and at promoting conditions in which Guatemalans can exercise their constitutional rights with no limitations other than those established by law. It is in this field that we have been most severely criticized internationally  but it is certainly the field in which we have had thegreatest success nationally.Constant activity by trade unions and farm workers  constant claims by some organized sectors  and constant criticism - sometimes even harsh criticism - from those in the opposition: all this is the best proof of the fact that participation is open to and safe for all in Guatemala  a nation where not long ago the mere fact of not conforming was a sufficient cause for repression.Also in this field  things that up to now would have been hard to believe are becoming a constant practice in the exercise of rights: recourse to habeas corpus for cases that have occurred during the period of this Government  with positive results; the existence of organizations that engage in constant militant action demanding that persons allegedly kidnapped in the past be produced. (Actually  they have not been any more successful than those alleging threats by Government officials.) All this has taken place without any political party or peoples'organization being able to claim the commission of any repressive acts or the physical disappearance  torture or kidnapping of any of their members.Of course  in Guatemala  like anywhere else in the world  the Government cannot prevent or foresee criminal actions by common delinquents  terrorists or extreme-right organizations; but it has taken the decision to act vigorously against any group or organization of whatever kind that commits illegal acts. Nowadays  suspects are tried in court.In this connection  we are trying to establish standards for social action*  first  the Government guarantees the exercise of constitutional rights  providing security to those who exercise them within the law. Secondly  in the case of acts that might violate a constitutional right  citizens may have recourse to the Supreme Court or to the Constitutional Court to request redress from acts of the Government. Thirdly  all political  social  trade union or human rights organizations must abide by the law and the Constitution. Fourthly  the Government will exercise its full power to punish those who transgress legal and constitutional limits. So far  aware of the phase we are going through  we have exercised prudence and flexibility in that regard. It should be pointed out that to this day all the social or labor conflicts which have required the presence of the Government or of the President have been solved by means of agreement through dialog  without any need to use force  and within the limits of the law.I wish to say a few words about the guerilla activities.In Guatemala  subversive acts still occur sporadically in certain isolated areas in the north and north-east of the country. At present  these are confined to terrorist acts  which claim victims for no purpose and do harm to remote villages of indigenous farm workers. It would seem as if an attempt is being made to inflict undeserved tribulations on these workers  adding violence to their traditional problems of economic  social and political neglect and making it evenmore difficult and costly for them to meet their most urgent needs. For our part  in confronting the guerilla activities we have adopted an attitude of legitimate defense of a process that belongs to the people. We have acted with comprehension and with caution  but also with firmness. Some guerilla leaders have been prosecuted  but we have also pardoned those who have voluntarily -urned themselves in  coming down from the mountains as more and more of them in remote places learn about the process of opening a broad political base.It is true that many people who in the past had been involved in subversion -mainly farm workers - had committed such acts because they had thought there was no other way for them to participate. But with the success in broadening the political base  and with their conviction that they had been deceived with false promises on all sides  they abandoned the theory that armed struggle was the only way to solve the national problems. It is indeed unfortunate that the orthodox  methodological rigidity of a defeated movement still causes suffering among some groups in small pockets of the rural population.In practice  this fruitless struggle can only be an obstacle to the development of the regions that formerly were the objects of violence. The democratic Government will have to divert some resources  which  instead of being used to meet urgent needs  will have to be used to give protection and security to those who are forced to become involved in a lost cause  a meaningless cause. As was wisely said to me by a democratic farm-hand ""... by what authority does a man who calls himself a revolutionary leader -simply because he is wearing an olive-green uniform - label as a mistake the popular decision and oppose it with weapons? People chose democracy and the guerrillas lost the battle. The least they can do is to accept the will of the people.""On behalf of the Government of the Republic  as a representative of the people I personally invite those groups still fighting against the Government to review their position  analyze the circumstances and take into account the will of the people and become integrated into the institutional  political process of the country - a country that is peacefully trying to establish a pluralistic and participatory democracy.There is room for all in Guatemala  for we have gone from the search for national security in the past to the doctrine of stability at present. At the root of the problem of stability is the conceptual error that in practice insurgency is an objective in itself  forgetting that the ultimate objective is the well-being of the population. Dogmatic attitudes turn the method into the objective or become a way of life.This same conceptual error had led our Army to consider national security as an objective in itself. This has now changed. As part of the doctrinal changes beginning in our country we have clearly established that national security is not in itself an objective to be pursued but  rather  an instrument in the service of stability which  together with development  will allow for a social state that will bring about the common good and well-being. Thus  security and development are instruments in the service of stability - and that is a prerequisite for well-being. The doctrine now underpinning the thinking of the Government ofGuatemala is ""national stability"" for democracy and development - and we have set aside the doctrine of national security.With regard to economic policy  we have had to face disorder  corruption  flight of capital  speculation  devaluation of our currency and unemployment and underemployment  hand in hand with the traditional burdens of extremely low salaries  concentration of production means  and tax evasion. Our incipient democracy must then deal with the economic problems while taking into account the firm decision of a people aware of its responsibility and contributing to the country  not with their own personal interests in mind  but in the full application of its democratic calling. The Government  as the representative of the people  launched a plan of economic reorganization whereby it seeks to stabilize our currency  provide the inputs necessary for production and open up new credit sources to bring about a balance among those financial decisions that impose certain economic conditions on the upper and middle-class sectors of the population  for the benefit of the neediest.The effects of the reorganization plan have been positive  but acceptance by consensus through agreement by means of dialog by which ""the highest possible degree of agreement within disagreement"" is reached is perhaps the most important accomplishment so far. The success of such a dialog can be seen in the few socio-economic conflicts this Government has had to face. The economic reorganization program has already produced some achievements and has laid the basis for restoring the people's confidence in their institutions  without there being any need to resort to violence in order to create a new model for social contracts. The obvious results of this new state of awareness are peace and the economic dynamics that have put national production at the service of all Guatemalans.But we must also go from international isolation to the policy of active neutrality. The polarization  confrontation and intolerance that resulted in a tragedy in Guatemala also led the country to isolation  which was viewed with indifference by some previous administrations and which in the long run caused very serious political  financial and commercial repercussions. Our country lost credibility in the international community. External sources of financing became severely restricted  and our trade  political and diplomatic relations were also affected.Governments in the late 1970s and early 1980s adopted a defensive attitude. The negative image projected by those Governments resulted in a distorted view of our procedures  attitudes and values.I do not deny the seriousness of that situation and the harshness of the confrontation; but exaggerated accounts reached such a point that the true state of affairs could no longer be ascertained  even by those of us who observed the tragedy at first hand. There was a convulsion to distort the facts by those who lived through them and those who passed judgment on them.In any case  one thing is certain: violence became the common denominator. We lived in an atmosphere of violence  and it had a bearing on each and everyone. Nevertheless - and probably because of our Utopian culture  our ancestral humanism  and our religious upbringing - instead of violence becoming a generalized way of life  it led us systematically and permanently to reject authoritarian governments and violence itself as political instruments. This rejection of tragedy  of the imposition of force and confrontation  was the basis for the people's support for democracy  for non-violence in internal affairs and for our search for peace externally.The people of Guatemala long for peace; that is why they support the path of agreement through dialog as the working method of the new democratic Government and of active neutrality in regional affairs. Underlying Guatemalan society is the determination to break with the past and optimistically seek a future that will temper the attitude of all Guatemalan political and social sectors for many years to come and convince the electorate. Hence the Government's decision not to dig up the past. Owing to the difficult fight  many groups involved in the confrontation would otherwise be affected and  instead of creating conditions for a harmonious and institutionalized democracy  we would be creating conditions for new confrontations.But because history cannot be denied  something must be done to strengthen the judicial system  to make it a legal and peaceful instrument for ensuring the application of justice. The Government - the Executive - will face the historical truth: the Supreme Court  the tribunals  the desire for justice. In such a climate  there is very little chance for success for organized groups seeking revenge through the avenue of justice or pressing charges. They are the vestiges of the pain inflicted by the tragedy  but they belong to the past and cannot contribute anything to the future.In the international sphere  particularly with reference to our Central American area  this rejection of violence  this desire for peace by the Guatemalan people  constitutes the basis for our rejection of confrontation among fraternal countries; it has led to our persisting in the search for negotiated  diplomatic solutions  as well as for a permanent instrument of dialog to reach agreements and accords.Hence we proclaim our active neutrality; we unwaveringly support Contadora's efforts; and at a meeting of Presidents that took place in Guatemala  in thevillage of Esquipulas we have proposed the creation of a Central American Parliament.I am aware that it is necessary for me to be specific about our position on certain international issues and our activities on the international scene.We wish to see international relations without ideological complexes. One of the basic principles of our political stand is ideological pluralism  we maintain that societies and peoples have a right to their own ideological convictions and to foster the social model they consider most appropriate. We believe that pluralism in a democratic society is the basis for peace. Hence our stand on active neutrality is not necessarily ideological neutrality.We are in favor of democracy in the world and we affirm the right of peoples to participate openly in building their own future. We do not believe in authoritarian governments of any kind  because we do no recognize the right of any one group  party or ruling elite to put constraints on popular sovereignty. At the same time  we are not loath to maintain relations with any Government that legitimately represents its people  whatever its ideology. We require mutual respect in our relations and energetically reject any physical aggression against our territory; however  we also commit ourselves not to carry out any act of aggression against any other country  except in exercise of the right to legitimate defense.We proclaim the need for mutual respect. In the interrelated world in which we live today  international organizations issue value judgments on the activities of member countries. On the other hand  on the modern international scene there is no President or Head of Government in the world who does not have to consider daily  to a greater or lesser extent  protests  criticisms  petitions or support from all sorts of groups.Nevertheless  the Democratic Government of Guatemala is not bothered by comments or even criticism which other Governments might voice about its actions as such. He only ask them to be willing to listen to us and discuss our objections; we ask that our realities be respected and that the facts be judged objectively  we have a country with doors open to visitors; we want our true situation to be looked at closely but dispassionately  and any suggestions or contributions aimed at improving our Government's activities will always be welcome. In other words  we ask to be treated with respect and not with contempt because of our past or our sufferings.What we reject is direct aggression by one country against another; during its history. Central America has been the victim of overt or covert military aggressions  we reject that possibility. I should say that aggressions have come in the past from countries of different ideologies. In the face of aggression that could lead to conflict between nations  we propose the alternative of diplomacy and political methods.Hence our active neutrality; we do not justify or explain regional wars which only produce destruction or death  nor do we accept the existence of any international or ideological right to provoke confrontations between sister States. We Guatemalans affirm that violence  even when labeled ""revolutionary""  is new at this historical moment an obstacle to Central American development because funds are allocated for weapons rather than to meet our needs.We have asserted our neutrality with regard to the differences that might exist among the Central American countries and  at the same time  our energetic  diplomatic and political participation in the search for an understanding and in the mechanisms for integration and our firm support for democratic and pluralistic peace movements. Therefore  confronted with the Nicaraguan problem  we sympathize with the opposing parties which are involved in a peaceful struggle for a broadening of the political base  and  without taking sides in the existing armed conflict  we believe that the reasons for the struggle will diminish as the political atmosphere becomes more open  without ideological prejudices  with pluralistic attitudes and unconditional respect for the social and political sectors of the opposition.In this effort  no doubt  the two super—Powers have played a very important role and bear a tremendous historic responsibility. The world has become affected by a constant rivalry between them  causing at times through their presence internal conflicts and international confrontations. Sometimes  it must be admitted  it has been cm the initiative of both and sometimes at the request of national political groups  but in both cases the consequences have been the same.In the case of Latin America and especially Central America  we shall always have to take the United States into consideration in one way or another  but the overt or covert influence of the Soviet Union has given some national political confrontations the characteristics of international conflicts  thus risking their becoming part of the so-called East-West confrontation. We wish to avoid this possibility  and we maintain that we reject war aid armed confrontations because the strategic position of Central America makes it vulnerable to involvement in them. The regional Governments thus also must shoulder the tremendous responsibility for causing or preventing a holocaust which may occur if we do not act with caution in the face of the historical juncture in which we are living. The time has come for a break with orthodoxy  rejecting alignments which might lead to conflicts and establishing new priorities: the national interest first  followed by the regional interest and the international interest in that order.Therefore  on behalf of the men and women of out countries  who are tired of violence and despair  who are anxious to have political stability so as to achieve development  I dare to ask the super-Powers to end their competition over our territories and to discuss how best they can help us. We welcome all those who wish to contribute to the consolidation of democracy in our nations and thus to enable our people and not computers to determine our destiny.I firmly believe that the developed countries of Europe and the Orient can play a very special role in this drama to achieve moderation in dealing with conflicts and to support human development on the basis of democracy and pluralism  because in the event of a world conflagration both the countries of those regions and ours would share the dubious honor of risking the destruction of our hopes for a better life.Speaking as the President of Guatemala and on behalf of all my people  I am aware of the historic importance of the times in which we are living and I place rays elf at the disposal of all the nations of the world  so that  with the good will of a magical country full of history and hope  we may contribute to the birth of an enlightened humanity and to the achievement of that Utopia the search for which after the Second World War led to the creation of this wonderful Organizations the consolidation of peace."
"60",2942,"GUY",41,1986,"I speak from this rostrum as the representative of one of the many small countries which constitute the majority of the membership of this Organization. I speak on behalf of Guyana  whose people jealously guard their independence. The Guyanese people believe in their right to fashion their own society free from outside interference and to order their international conduct in accordance with their own interests. Above all  the Guyanese people recognize that international relations should be based cm the rule of law. That is why Guyana is fully committed to the United Nations system  its imperfections notwithstanding.One year ago we undertook an intense self-examination during the observance of the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations. The outcome of the deliberations then fell short of the expectations of a majority of us. The occasion none the less provided an opportunity for Member States to recommit themselves to fulfilling the purposes and principles of the Charter and to strengthening the capacity of this Organization to be more effective in today's wor Id.We should examine at this Assembly the extent to which we have been faithful to the re-commitments which those ceremonies stimulated and the objectives which they recalled.Even as that occasion was being celebrated  the Organization was confronted with a challenge that pertained to its viability and future. I refer to the severe financial crisis which necessitated special consideration by the General Assembly. Its roots are widely recognized and lie essentially in certain attitudes of Member States towards their obligations flowing from the Charter.Our collective response to that crisis has been a frank examination of the administrative and financial efficiency of the Organization. The Group of High-Level Inter-Governmental Experts has put forward a set of recommendations for administrative and financial reform which merit the most careful study.Guyana hopes that the decisions on this issue will be fully responsive to the economic and social needs of the developing countries and will preserve the democratic character of decision-making in the Assembly.But the crisis facing the United Nations goes beyond administrative and financial issues. For the United Nations is  in the words of the Charter  the Organization of the peoples of the world. It represents and embodies their common aspirations no less than their differences; and it is required to function in the context of the constantly growing complexities of international relations.Differences are inevitable  but they must not be made into impediments. It is therefore only to the extent that our Organization is seen and utilized as a forum for accommodating and harmonizing conflicting viewpoints that its Charter is truly being employed in the service of international understanding and international peace.Sadly  it has not always been so used in the past. Even now there are veiled attempts to maneuver the Organization into the pursuit of narrow national interests.In no other area is the need to harmonize differences more urgent and crucial than in that of disarmament  particularly in its nuclear aspect. It is a source of profound concern that on this issue  where the safety of the entire planet is so manifestly at stake  undue pre-eminence is given to ideological considerations  and not enough deference is paid to the heavy responsibilities towards humankind which the awesome nuclear arsenals impose on the nuclear Powers  especially the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. What is worse  screens of one kind or another are erected behind which to pursue the further refinement of nuclear weapons.Guyana is happy  to note  however  that despite these negative tendencies the goal of nuclear disarmament has not been obscured and that initiatives in respect of its attainment are being proposed and pursued.In this context Guyana considers the moratorium on nuclear testing declared by the Soviet Union - and subsequently renewed - to be a positive indication of a desire to reduce the threat of nuclear war. Likewise  the successful outcome of the Stockholm Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a source of some optimism. In addition  Guyana notes with satisfaction that bilateral exchanges between the two super-Powers have intensified during the past year and that negotiations are going on in Geneva.Member States have made a solemn commitment in our Charter to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors.Inspired by these considerations and his deep commitment to global peace  the President of the Republic of Guyana  Comrade Hugh Desmond Hoyte  made a plea on behalf of the entire human race when  at the recently concluded Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  he proposed that a message be sent to the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States. That message urged  among other things:""That they use their best efforts to reduce the prevailing tension and to promote a climate of confidence in the world ...""Naturally  therefore  Guyana hopes that the Iceland Summit will be a major point of reference on the road to disarmament and that thereafter the momentum will be maintained in a single-minded manner and lead to substantial achievements.There is no doubt that our efforts in the field of disarmament have engendered a measure of optimism. The international community must bring the same approach to the creation of an environment which would facilitate solutions to problems in various areas of the world.The main impediments have been the intrusion of external interests into the search for solutions to some of these problems. This is so whether we refer to the continued division imposed on the Korean people  the dispossession of the Palestinians  the attempt to dismember Lebanon  or the violation of the territorial integrity of Cyprus and the frustration of its unity. Guyana's position on all these issues is well known. We call for an end to outside interference  for the full mobilization of the energies of the international community to assist the affected nations and peoples  and for full support to the Secretary-General in his efforts to bring lasting peace to these troubled areas. The international community also needs to be vigilant against any erosion of the gains achieved by the Secretary-General in his attempt to bring about a negotiated political solution in respect of Afghanistan. Guyana nourishes the hope that those negotiations will soon reach a conclusive stage based on the sovereign interests of the parties directly concerned. Similarly  all efforts should be intensified to bring an end to the unfortunate war between Iraq and Iran.My own region - Latin America and the Caribbean - has a long-established tradition of opposition to intervention and interference in the internal affairs of States. That does not mean  however  that the region has been free of conflict. Yet  within recent times  there has been a discernible trend in favor of autonomous development and a movement away from confrontation towards co-operation and integration. We see evidence of that development in the Caribbean  where  despite some negative influences stemming from the external environment  innovative steps are being taken to promote and enhance economic and political co-operation.Throughout the region  States have been demonstrating their determination to advance the integration process through more intense bilateral and subregional arrangements. The Latin American Economic System (LAES) will later this month hold consultations aimed at strengthening the economic and political relations of its member States. Within the Organization of American States (OAS)  the principle of universal membership has recorded a notable advance with the recent proposals for the reform of the organizations charter. These tendencies demonstrate a political disposition on the part of Latin America and the Caribbean to work collectively for the solution of their manifold problems and for the protection and promotion of their political and economic interests.Consistent with this attitude  the Governments and peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean are desirous of negotiated solutions to the political problems of Central America. They have therefore been solidly in support of the Contadora process  which is designed to find a regional solution to a regional problem. Unhappily  appreciation for that approach is not shared by all those who are   recognized as having an interest in the resolution of this crisis.It is all but universally recognized that a solution to the problems of Central America lies in the espousal of negotiation and dialog and the abandonment of policies of intimidation  coercion and destabilization. The Assembly must give unequivocal support and encouragement to the work of the Contadora States and the Lima Support Group. All States should co-operate actively with the efforts of those countries to ensure the advance of the peace process and should refrain from actions or attitudes that hamper that process.Guyana supports the Government and people of Nicaragua in their efforts to protect their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and encourages dialog between the parties in El Salvador.In reviewing these situations of conflict and tension  we note that some give ground for sober encouragement  where will and determination were present  results - however limited - were recorded. In the quest for a world free of apartheid  however  we find some Members of the Organization most equivocal in their support for the radical solutions the situation demands. This attitude is most disturbing  for apartheid is the greatest moral issue ever faced by mankind. It is a situation in which millions of black people are brutalized from birth  corralled in a slave society and wantonly exploited to swell many a coffer.Let there be no illusion about the dismantling of apartheid. The people of South Africa have long recognized that this is their responsibility to discharge. Nelson Mandela voiced the conviction of his people when he said  more than two decades ago:""It is first and foremost by our own struggle and sacrifice inside South Africa itself that victory over white domination and apartheid can be won."" South Africa is a land ruled by the gun - one in which  as Mandela observed  ""all opportunities for peaceful agitation and struggle have been closed."" It was so then  two decades ago. It is worse now.White supremacy in South Africa was created by violence and is maintained by violence. The people of South Africa have no option but to rely increasingly on armed struggle in their efforts to recover their freedom. Increased international pressure on the Pretoria regime will  however  help to reduce the cost of that struggle for the masses in South Africa. The same phenomenon is at work in respect of Namibia. The United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia is being stymied by the obstinacy of the South African racists and the introduction of irrelevant and extraneous matters such as linkage into the freedom process.Turning to the state of the world economy  there is good reason to be apprehensive. While low interest rates and the decline in inflation are hopeful signs that are still with us  the expectation that they would stimulate the world economy has not been fulfilled. Instead  we continue to be confronted with sluggish growth in world trade and the knowledge that the international economy will advance more slowly than predicted at the start of the year because of the disappointing economic performance of major industrial countries. Thus  the promising levels of economic activity achieved in 1984 have not been maintained  and the anticipated recovery is yet to be realized.The low contributions of the economies of developing countries to the recovery process derives from a lack of effort on their part but from their incapacity to promote self-sustained growth and development. Little if any regard is paid to that fact  and the prices of primary commodities have been artificially depressed tosuch an extent that they are today lower than at any time previously. The story is very much the same where protectionist and other trade-distorting devices have been applied unceasingly against the exports of developing countries.The loss in income resulting from the inaccessibility of the markets of developed countries to those exports has badly hurt growth and development. The crisis of debt and development is yet another constraining factor. Co-responsibility in the resolution of the debt problem is widely acknowledged  yet the burden of adjustment still rests heavily on the shoulders of the developing countries.The present economic system  in ignoring the developing countries  inhibits recovery and is a sore reminder of the unequal relations between the North and the South. With the persistence of such deterrents to economic activity and prosperity  the challenge faced in dealing with the world economic situation is of particularly pressing concern. Without positive action  the prospects for all countries - developed and developing - remain uncertain.We should refocus attention on the policy initiatives required to attain strong and sustained growth and to create balance and equity between North and South. The reversal of the present trend of net transfers from the developing to the developed world and of a decline in financial flows from the developed to the developing countries would make a positive contribution to the realization of those objectives. There are also other goals to be pursued  including stability in exchange rates and a lowering of real interest rates.Several opportunities could prove advantageous if grasped. The new round of multilateral trade negotiations recently launched in Uruguay gives the North a chance to make good on its promise to liberalize and extend world trade for the benefit of all countries. There is also the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  scheduled to be held next year.For this to be successful  however  there has to be a manifestation of changed attitudes on the part of the developed countries on such issues as commodity and other related problems  including that which affects the revenue of commodity producers. Similarly  the decision of the Assembly to address the issue of the external debt crisis and development specifically can be a critical step towards finding a comprehensive and lasting solution to that problem.However  in order to be consistent with the objective of fostering concurrent co-operative action to strengthen the relationship between trade and other economic policies  the developed and developing countries should also consider ways to improve the functioning of the international monetary system.Meanwhile  the countries of the South are determined to strengthen co-operation among themselves. New initiatives have recently been taken  and there is already evidence of the further development of complementaries between their economies. The Assembly should give greater encouragement to that process.I wish to welcome a development of a not entirely different kind. That is the intensification of international co-operation to eradicate the scourge of drugs. This acknowledges that the interdependence between producers  traffickers and consumers is so real and complex that only a truly international effort can cope effectively with a problem that has assumed global proportions. Laws exist to deal with this problem  but an increase in their severity would not be a sufficient deterrent and cure  for an assault on drug abuse must embrace economic considerations.Viewed from a certain perspective  some illegal drugs fall into the category of primary commodities produced by developing countries. Peasant farmers certainly see it in that light and  in a general situation of hopelessly depressed primary commodities  the operations of the market place have so far given a comparative advantage to the cultivation of illegal drugs. The attack on dampening production must therefore be concerted  but it must also involve correlative international arrangements to enable farmers in developing countries to receive fair and equitable returns for their legitimate primary produce  such as sugar. We must create comprehensive disincentives for the production of illegal drugs and increase the incentives for the cultivation of crops which sustain health.Similarly  at the other end of the spectrum - consumption - there is need for accelerated national action to reduce demand. The greatest irony would be for the producing developing countries to take firm action within their territories to lower and eliminate levels of production  only to witness an increase in the productive capacity of the greater consuming countries. The drug problem  in all its dimensions  requires resolute and determined international co-operation. In this regard  the countries of the Caribbean Community have for some time new recognized the dangers which this plague holds for the fabric of their societies and the need for concerted action among themselves and for further co-operation within the international community.Guyana therefore heartily endorses the efforts of the United Nations  especially those of the Secretary-General  to combat drug abuse and illegal trafficking. In particular  we call for maximum support for the convening next year of a world conference to deal with all aspects of the drug question.In spite of the hopes and expectations which the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations encouraged  hostile criticisms of the Organization have persisted. As the Secretary-General observed  with such customary insight  in his annual report.Persistent  tendentious criticism of the United Nations by relatively small groups has affected confidence in the effectiveness  if not the goals  of the Organization."" (A/41/1  p. 17) Those of us who wish to optimize the use of the Organization in favor of peace and development must work resolutely against those critics whose objective is to diminish the influence of the Organization or  worse still  to work for its destruction.In this regard  among the most forthright defenders and advocates of a strong family of international organizations has been the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Through its relentless insistence on respect for independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  the strengthening of international co-operation on the basis of the sovereign equality of States  an end to relations of domination and exploitation and on the peaceful settlement of disputes  that Movement constitutes a positive factor in international relations. Support for the United Nations and respect for decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council have been a cornerstone of our Movement.Even more heartening to Guyana than the support of Governments and movements for the United Nations is the expression of confidence in the Organization by ordinary peoples and groups around the world. A recently published survey reached the following interesting conclusions*  first  among those who expressed an opinion  more than 55 per cent in the United Kingdom and the United States  and almost two thirds in France and Germany  said that the United Nations was doing a good job or a very good job. Secondly  58 per cent of the French  73 per cent of the Germans  79 per cent of the British  86 per cent of the Americans and Japanese clearly said ""No"" to the provocative question: ""Would the world be better off without the united Nations?"" Thirdly  women are more favorable to the United Nations than men and  lastly  Americans below the age of 40 appreciate the United Nations more than the older generation.One of the clear conclusions that emerged is that  among the countries polled  whatever may be the views of their media and their Governments  the majority of their peoples believe in the efficacy of the United Nations. The tasks facing the Organization are not easy  but their fulfillment is compelling  in this respect  we praise the work done by Mr. Jaime de Pinies of Spain  President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. Your own unanimous election  Mr. President  and our knowledge of your wide experience and consummate skills instill us with the confidence that you will be equal to the enormous demands of your office."
"61",2986,"HND",41,1986,"I wish first  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-first session. Your election  which is an honor to your country and to you  is a recognition of your personal and professional qualities and constitutes a clear expression of the international community's confidence that you will guide the Assembly's work to success.I am also happy  sir  to express my Government's particular satisfaction over the excellent way in which your predecessor  Mr. Don Jaime de Pinies  presided over the Assembly's work last year. Our warmest fraternal greetings go to such an illustrious citizen of Spain  a country to which  foe obvious reasons  we Hondurans feel very close ties.I wish also to express ray Government's appreciation of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the excellent work he is doing in his important post. I am pleased to see him fully recovered from the health problems that he had a few months ago.On 27 January this year  Mr. Jose Azcona assumed the presidency of the Republic of Honduras  as a result of the majority will of the Honduran people freely expressed in elections held on 24 November 1985. Although such an event would be regarded as normal elsewhere  because it happens regularly  it has special significance for us  as it was a reaffirmation of the democratic system of government that our people has chosen  and was a big step in the creation of the necessary political climate to improve its general living conditions.In a region such as Central America  where taking power by violent or irregular means has been the rule for parts of our independent existence  the interruption of that dramatic tradition of coups d'etat  guerrilla bands and electoral fraud means the elimination of one of the causes of the regional crisis. That is why the coming to power of regimes clearly on the basis of a popular mandate freely expressed at the polls  as has been the case with Honduras  Costa Rica  El Salvador and Guatemala  constitutes the best augury for peacefully overcoming economic  social and cultural underdevelopment. The Government of Honduras has as its fundamental economic and political objectives on the one hand the improvement of the quality of life * its population and on the other the consolidation and development of democracy.It is true that our problems  like those of other countries of the region  are caused  inter alia  by economic backwardness  the existence of socially underprivileged and the lack of pluralistic democratic political development. In order to achieve our objectives  Honduras requires not only dynamic honest and efficient public and private action  but also a climate of peace and security that will make possible a process of development in freedom and with justice.Just as we have learned how to elect our authorities by means of referendums and to solve our internal problems through dialog  so we wish to see at the international level the settlement of existing differences by the peaceful means of settling disputes which exist in law. Thus  with the Republic of El Salvador  with which for a long time we have had a border dispute  we have concluded two important treaties this year: one aimed at finalizing the demarcation line agreed upon in 1980  and the other containing the commitment to submit the dispute jointly to the International Court of Justice.The President of the Republic  Jose Azcona Hoyo  while addressing the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador during his recent official visit to that sister country  stated the following:""The commitment made by Honduras and El Salvador to resort to the International Court of Justice will put an end to our border disputes and thereby to the friction and disagreement they have caused between our two countries.""Thus we are moving towards a definitive solution of the land  island and maritime dispute  in the knowledge that recourse to peaceful means of settling disputes between States is a considerable contribution to the maintenance of peace and harmony in the American continent. My Government was convinced of this when signing the Treaty on the delimitation of maritime borders with the Republic of Colombia. This Treaty  after ratification by both States  will open new avenues of cooperation and understanding.In contrast to that constructive attitude  the Government of Nicaragua has attempted to disavow and reject that Treaty  alleging that it violates alleged Nicaraguan rights of sovereignty in the areas concerned. Honduras  in its note of reply  has declared that Nicaragua's claim is unjustified and unacceptable  and has proposed the continuance of talks with a view to a final fixing of the maritime border between the two countries on the basis of the line traditionally established and observed by them.The United Nations system offers a praiseworthy model for the improvement of international co-operation. My Government has taken note with interest of the Secretary-General's report on the situation in Central America and is pleased that the attention of the international community has been drawn to the critical economic situation in the area  as is evidenced in the decline of savings and investments by over 40 per cent between 1978 and 1985  the deterioration in the terns of trade of approximately 50 per cent and a fall of 25 per cent in the value of exports. As the report points out  the United Nations has stepped up its co-operation efforts in Central America and has devoted almost 3100 million per year to the region.I am pleased to note the efficiency with which the United Nations Development Program has been working in Honduras. By country is uniquely situated in terms of co-operation for development  because the resources allotted to it have been increased through projects financed under cost-sharing arrangements between Honduras and friendly countries.I also wish to mention the efforts made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) whose agency has taken care of 121 900 Central American refugees  of whom 46 000 have been recorded in Honduras  thus making Honduras one of the two countries with the largest number of refugees in Latin America and the Caribbean.My Government  recognizing with appreciation the efforts of the UNHCR to alleviate these problems  makes a new appeal to all nations of the world to share the heavy burden that is borne by the Republic of Honduras. This affects our economy and our society  and the democratic Government of President Jose Azcona has initiated a new dialog with the multilateral agencies which support economic and social development and humanitarian support. My Government believes that technical  financial and humanitarian co-operation  both international and multilateral  especially that related to the United Nations system  constitutes an important contribution to national development. In this regard  we commend the additional efforts  which are also referred to in the Secretary-General's report  made by the United Nations Development Program  the United Nations Children's Find  the united Nations Fund for Population Activities  the United Nations High Commissioner foe Refugees and other organs of the system to support the efforts of Honduras nationally mid regionally.My Government remains convinced that the question of Korea must be resolved peacefully through dialog and negotiation between South Korea and North Korea. We wish to reaffirm our conviction that the purposes of the United Nations make it essential that all nations that wish to do so aid have assumed the obligations embodied in the Charter form part of our Organization.With regard to Kampuchea  my Government supports the resolutions of the General Assembly calling for the withdrawal of the occupation forces  the restoration and maintenance of Kampuchea's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and the affirmation of the right of its people to determine its own future without foreign interference.On the situation in the Middle East  Honduras is aware of the need to resort to negotiation as the main instrument in a peaceful settlement of the conflict  and views with satisfaction efforts by the State of Israel and the Arab Republic of Egypt to promote peace in that region.Furthermore  my Government deplores the armed intervention in Afghanistan; it urges all States to respect the sovereignty  territorial integrity  political independence  and non-alignment of that country; and restates the need for an immediate  unconditional and total withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.With regard to the unfortunate conflict in the South Pacific between two countries with which we have the friendliest of relations  strengthened by our common democratic ideals  Honduras must express its wish that the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom will do their best to settle their differences peacefully  definitively  and in accordance with justice.Turning to the political process in the Philippines  the Honduran Government welcomes the fact that the country has been able to return to the path of democracy. This auspicious event will allow the Philippines to realize its hopes for development in peace and freedom.It is also a matter of particular satisfaction for ray Government to note the forthcoming meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachov  since in a world thrown into turmoil by confrontation  it is an encouraging sign along the road to world peace.Until 1978  Central American nations had been showing marked economic growth. Although the period 1973 to 1978 witnessed an increase in the price of their main imports  the countries of the area were able to sort out their difficulties owing to an improvement in the international price of their export commodities and the inflow of external capital. Things changed drastically beginning in 1979  a year when a recession began  aggravated by the weakening of the world economy marked by a decline in production and exports  an increase in oil prices  and interest rates  a fall in private investment  and the accompanying factors of increased unemployment and intensification of political and social conflict in some countries of the region.As a natural consequence. Central American countries have had to endure high fiscal and balance-of-payments deficits and a serious foreign currency shortage. The latter not only had an impact on trade with third countries  but it also had a negative effect on regional trade.Internally  our countries have been forced to adopt severe measures designed to reduce the fiscal deficit through cuts in current expenditure and capital investment  tax adjustments  the elimination of subsidies to staple commodities  increases in public service charges and wage-freeze policies. These measures  which call for serious social sacrifices  naturally result in tensions which in turn aggravate the political and social crisis. According to data from the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA)  for 1980  64 per cent of Central Americans were living in poverty.Today  some of the negative factors which led to the crisis have abated. Nevertheless  the negative impact of the last six-year period will affect our peoples for many years  especially if the international structural factors which seriously limit our development persist.When signing the Charter of the United Nations  Member countries reaffirmed their:""faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the humanperson"" I feel that this session offers the right opportunity for all nations to recommit themselves to the observance of human rights.My Government condemns all acts which violate the freedom and dignity of the individual. It is a pleasure for me to announce in this forum that last March I had the honor  as the representative of my Government  to sign the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Torture  in the knowledge that respect for human rights is not a gracious concession by a State but rather a legal and moral obligation.All mankind is increasingly appalled by terrorism which continues to plunge into mourning the homes of innocent victims irrespective of age  race  sex or religion  and endangers the life of passengers on aircraft and ships. Moreover  we also note that diplomats and officials of international organizations are  with increasing frequency  the target of terrorist attacks.Terrorism threatens life  without discrimination  and constitutes a factor which has a negative impact on international co-existence. As stated by the President of my country:""There is no reason  nor can there be any  to justify man falling as low as to engage in this  the most dastardly and cruel form of violence."" and he adds:""The time has come for anti-terrorist conventions to cease being a dead letter and for the democratic countries to pool their efforts to ensure that the international community does not allow these criminal fanatics to act with impunity.""Among the many important items to be considered by this Assembly we have once again the item on ""The situation in Central America: threats to international peace and security and peace initiatives."" As a country in the region  Honduras wishes to state its views on the item. It is urgent to make an effort to understand the course of the Central American crisis and analyze the obstacles on the way to peace. Such an effort implies setting aside prejudices  preconceived notions and rash alignments in order to allow for thoughtful and productive analysis. Only in that manner will we be able to avoid greater confusion with regard to the Central American situation and foster the hope of finding a negotiated and peaceful solution.Central America has been molded by special circumstances arising out of its unique geography and history  which have made true interdependence necessary. Central America has its roots in the colonial past and in its history of federation  which led to very similar conditions of political instability  economic backwardness and dependence on others  all of which have given rise to dangerous social tensions. Beginning in 1979 internal strife brought about by social unrest in certain countries became instruments in East-Wost confrontation. Democratic hopes were dashed by the imposition of new dictatorial practices and systems which denied the right of peoples to self-determination. The struggle for national liberation in a Central American country resulted in its total alignment with the Soviet bloc. The economic plan announced  which was to bring its people out of poverty  was distorted in order to establish and consolidate a real war-machine with hegemonistic and expansionist designs.These facts  which sum up the recent history of that country  have brought cm insecurity  mistrust and tension in the entire area. Likewise  the contradiction between the democratic aspirations of the Nicaraguan people and the implementation of oppressive internal measures  solely to serve foreign interests  have increased the social divisions in that country. It has brought about a stream of refugees and of persons who have been persecuted for political reasons  all fleeing toneighboring countries  and a simultaneous emergence of Hicaraguan armed opposition  which is trying to get back on the original path of that popular rebellion.Mrs. Violeta de Chamorro - a member of the first junta of the Government for National Reconstruction in 1979 and the widow of Nicaraguan journalist Pedro Joaquin Chamorro  who was murdered - has denounced before the conscience of the world the fact that the Government of that country systematically represses all statements against the regime and that the Sandinist movement has turned all of Nicaragua into a vast concentration camp.The internal armed conflict in Nicaragua has had catastrophic effects in neighboring com tries. On the economic level it has brought about a deterioration in intra-regional trade  the flight of capital  and a decline in private foreign investment. On the political level  campaigns to discredit neighboring countries have been undertaken and social unrest has been encouraged. As regards security  encouragement has been given to subversive movements in the form of training  supplies  shelter  and communication and information facilities*  and the surrounding territories have been harassed by acts ranging from minor border incidents to bombings and massive artillery raids  such as the one carried out in my country in March this year.Likewise  under the leadership and with the advice of its political and military allies  the Sandinista government has developed an arms build-up without precedence or parallel in the Central American region and has imposed a strong militarization of its society to the detriment of the security of the other countries. it is well known that Nicaragua has received thousands of tons of weapons valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. As a country directly affected because of its geographical location  Honduras has stated that Nicaraguans should.through internal dialog  establish a pluralistic national reconciliation regime  breaking its political and military ties to the Soviet bloc  since these seriously disturb inter-Central American and international relations. Here we should recall resolution 1514 (XV)  adopted by this Assembly in 1960  which affirms the right of all peoples to choose the type of government which best suits them and declares that this should be done through democratic procedures  impartially applied  and based upon universal adult suffrage. Obviously  this resolution can be applied only if every State guarantees the full exercise of democracy internally.The Government of Honduras is aware of the fact that the best guarantee of its national sovereignty and independence rests with the faith of its people in a democratic way of life. Thus the true foundations of its security are the existence of a state of law  respect for the freedom and dignity of the individual  free and periodic elections and an improvement in the economic  social and cultural living conditions of Hondurans. On the other hand  as a peace-loving State Honduras bases its security mainly on international law - both universal and regional American law - as regards peace and legitimate collective self-defence. One of the basic tenets in this connection is that acts of aggression against one American State constitute acts of aggression against all other American States.It is precisely because the Organization of American States (OAS) constitutes a regional organization within the United Nations that Honduras wishes to refer to the peaceful settlement and collective security mechanisms of the hemisphere  both as a member of the OAS and as a member of the United Nations  in full agreement with the Charter adopted at San Francisco.Unfortunately  threats to peace and security in Central America persist. There are Governments bent on an unbridled arms race and unwarranted military development which refuse dialog for purposes of national reconciliation and which represent a threat and challenge to international peace and security. Foe these reasons  the Government of Honduras  in the exercise of its sovereignty and in compliance with the constitutional obligation to defend its people and territory with no less right than that enjoyed by other nations represented in this Assembly  has sought to establish a special relationship of security with the United States of America and other democratic Governments  a situation which we find essential until the present political and military situation in Central America changes.The Government of Honduras has participated actively in and supported collective negotiations cm establishing peace  and  with a high sense of responsibility  in the efforts made under the auspices of the Contadora Group.Ow 6 June this year  the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the countries of the Contadora Group presented to their Central American counterparts a draft Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America. As was stated at that time  the mediation role on substantive aspects of the document had come to an end  but the Contadora Group remained available to co-operate in negotiation of the operative aspects of the Act.It is the view of the Government of Honduras that the proposed Act was not adopted by the Central American States because it did not offer adequate guarantees concerning security democratization and national reconciliation. In the sphere of disarmament  the Contadora proposal deferred negotiations on the limitation  redaction and verification of military weapons and troops to some time after the entry into force of the Act. This is especially serious  because its acceptance would amount to legal approval of a de facto situation: the military hegemony of one Central American State over the others.Most Central American Governments have affirmed their political will to sign the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America when it contains verifiable agreements on security  democratization and national reconciliation. But the intransigence of the Sandinist Government has prevented such essential commitments' being included  with the necessary guarantees of implementation.I reaffirm the willingness of the Government of Honduras to continue exploring new formulas to overcome the obstacles to the agreement  with the understanding that a just solution must take account of the legitimate interests of all Central American States.We must  however  eliminate the impediments to fluidity in diplomatic activity  since such activity is inconsistent with Nicaragua's continued improper recourse to the highest international jurisdictional organ  making a mockery of the Contadora initiative and the prospects for a political solution of the crisis in Central America. On 25 July this year  the Sandinist Government filed with the International Court of Justice an application instituting proceedings against the Governments of Costa Rica and Honduras.Honduras  with a high sense of responsibility  has designated its agent before the Court. However  ray Government wishes to stress that the true origin of the situation about which the Government of Nicaragua is complaining can be found in internal political developments in Nicaragua itself. Those developments are the result of Nicaragua's unconditional political and military alignment with the Soviet bloc  which has led to friction with its neighbors and caused it to commit a series of illegal international acts  in particular encouraging and fomenting civil strife in countries of the region and the organization of armed raids into their territories.My Government welcomes the declaration by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the countries of the Contadora Group and the Support Group  distributed during the present session of the General Assembly  in which the following brotherly statement appears:""The peace of Central America is ... our own peace.""As Latin Americans we wish to see pluralistic democracy and economic andsocial development make headway in Central America.The Governments directly or indirectly involved in the conflict have theprimary responsibility for the prevention of war."" (A/41/662  p. 2)The Government of Honduras will maintain its full support for the peace initiatives of the Contadora Group  but the international community must realize that a negotiated resolution of the problems of our region will be achieved only whet the Soviet bloc decides to end its various methods of intervention in Central America  a region with which it has no relationship beyond the arrogant manifestations of its military machine.However  the undeniable  disturbing interference should not discourage us  but rather spur our efforts to achieve peace with freedom  justice and democracy. FOr those of us with faith in God it is very easy to believe that the future holds a better world  a world of peace  freedom and democracy."
"62",3055,"HTI",41,1986," I would first like to express ray delegation's warm congratulations to Ambassador Chouchury on his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. This great honor paid to him is undoubtedly also a well-deserved tribute to the Republic of Bangladesh  which has constantly endorsed and actively promoted the United Nations aims of peace and co-operation.I also wish to convey to Mr. Jaime de Pinies  his predecessor  our congratulations on his brilliant performance as President of the last session.It is a great honor for roe to speak in this august Assembly on behalf of a people which  with exemplary courage and at enormous sacrifice  has just brought to an end the long night of oppression that descended upon Haiti almost 30 years ago.(today  the freedom won by rebellion is being consolidated through dialog. The people  too long overlooked  fully intends to take charge of its destiny and  under the leadership of the National Governing Council  which wishes to act as the executor of the will of the people  the normalization of life is continuing. we have undertaken a coherent  realistic program of action  aimed primarily at establishing democracy cm a solid foundation that will preclude any attempt to bring back tyranny. It provides for reforms to promote and guarantee the functioning of authentic democracy based on the participation and consent of the governed and strict respect for their fundamental rights in full accordance with the purposes and principles of the united Nations Charter.In pursuit of this program  a political time-table has been drawn up with specific dates for the different stages that should lead  in November 1987  to free and fair elections and  in February 1988  to the establishment of a democratic Government in keeping with the aspirations of the Haitian people.Political prisoners  without exception  have been freed} there has been a mass return of exiles of all political persuasions; and the many decrees which in the past had unjustly robbed many of our countrymen of their nationality and goods have been repealed.At the same time  new legislation has been enacted on the formation of political parties  freedom of the press  and the establishment of a Constituent Assembly with the task of preparing a new  fundamentally democratic constitution by the end of 1986.Also  an election  for the first tine  of rural administrative councils has provided an essential stage in the prograssse of action designed to encourage the rural masses to participate actively in the nation's life from henceforth.Furthermore  the Haitian Government is keenly aware of the need for large-scale action to deal with the grave economic and social problems inherited from the former regime and to promote the structural changes that will make it possible to meet the expectations of the people. In this regard  the President of the National Governing Council  Lieutenant-General Henri Namphy  recently made the following statements""What we must do is lay the foundations of healthy political democracy and bring about a significant and lasting trans for nation of the living conditions of 6 million Haitians  75 per cent of whom live below the absolute poverty threshold.""Thus  the Government has resolutely embarked on the task of bringing about the necessary changes for the sound mid effective management of the national economy and public finances and to create the conditions needed for sustained development. Of course the main effort must be a national effort  although we must not underestimate the assistance that the international coEsnunity is giving us in one form or another.Indeed  we attach the greatest possible importance to the praiseworthy and persevering efforts of Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the United Nations Secretary-General  in terms of the mandate entrusted to him by the General Assembly to mobilize and co-ordinate for the benefit of the Republic of Haiti a substantial flew of aid which will make it possible for Haiti to overcome the structural obstacles and adverse conditions that stand in the way of its social and economic development. My delegation wishes to take this occasion to pay him a special tribute for those efforts.The Haitian Government is also pleased to note the understanding that has been shown in various organs and institutions of the united Nations system and the constructive attitude of Member States  which have spontaneously come forward to co-operate with us in a spirit of solidarity with Haiti and its people.This co-operation will certainly hasten the advent of the just and democratic society we so earnestly desire.It is in a context of violence and disturbing decline in the level of international relations that the forty-first session of the General Assembly is meeting. The Organization's repeated appeals to Member States to refrain from the threat or use of force in international relations have gone largely unheeded. Today  no part of the world is untouched by the crisis situation created by evermore numerous sources of conflict. Reaffirming its faith in our Organization  the Republic of Haiti  in the light of the ideals and principles of the Charter  wishes to clarify its position on the principal problems of international peace and security.The situation in southern Africa is marked by the persistence of two major challenges: the sorry question of apartheid and the 20-year-long illegal occupation of Namibia.Resorting to unprecedented oppression that has already caused more than 2 000 deaths over the past 18 months  the white majority persists in imposing its will on the black majority  the Coloreds and front-line countries; in addition  it refuses to leave Namibia  notwithstanding the demands of the United Nations.Nothing  therefore  could be more natural than for our Organization to take the lead and in using law  logic and common sense to oppose brute force in the service of blind passion  selfish interests and unwholesome prejudice. If  in the case of this conflict as in the case of so many others  its efforts have not yet met with success  that is due in large part to the collusion between South Africa and certain Governments that claim to oppose apartheid but at the same time refuse to match their words by deeds. The magnitude of that undisguised complicity is evidenced by their actions in the Security Council  which have resulted in protecting Pretoria so far from comprehensive mandatory sanctions  which are the only means of facilitating a peaceful negotiated solution.None the less  we have been encouraged by the determination of the Namibian and South African peoples  which  under the leadership  respectively  of the South West Africa People's Organization (SHAPO) and the South African liberation movements  are struggling by all possible means to put an end to what could be described as the scandal of this last part of the century.Nearer home  in Central America  the situation remains critical. For Haiti  which has made non-intervention  non-interference and the right of peoples to self-determination the bases of its foreign policy  the efforts of the Contadora Group provide the best chance of a comprehensive peaceful solution. They deserve our whole-hearted support.With regard to the conflict over the Malvinas  as we call them  we remain concerned at the absence of practical results. Our position is that reflected in resolution 40/21  adopted at the last session of the General Assembly  of which we were a sponsor. In essence  that resolution called for the resumption of negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom  without pre-conditions.Equally alarming for the international community are the situations in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  where the presence of foreign forces of occupation poses a threat to regional peace and stability  damages efforts towards co-operation and compromises opportunities for development. Notwithstanding the opinion of the vast majority of the international community and the unflagging efforts of the Secretary-General  no progress has been made towards political settlements that would end the indescribable sufferings of the Afghan and Kampuchean peoples.Jealous of its independence  Haiti has always opposed and will continue to oppose foreign intervention and occupation of any kind. We reaffirm our opposition to the presence of occupation forces  the withdrawal of which is the essential factor in creating conditions conducive to negotiated solutions that recognize the sovereignty  independence and non-aligned status of Afghanistan and Kampuchea.Still with regard to Asia  the Government of the Republic of Haiti is following with attention the moves towards the reunification of the Korean nation. It is pleased at the results already achieved and we unreservedly support the idea of the admission of the two Koreas as Members of the United Nations  in the hope that that integration would not only make it possible to hear at last the voice of the Korean people  but  further  facilitate the effective rapprochement of those two States by leading to a relaxation of the tensions in that part of the world.In the case of Cyprus  the Republic of Haiti  which has always recognized the virtues of dialog and working together to solve problems  believes that that country's situation is not irremediable. While reaffirming our full support for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus  we appeal to the parties concerned to support the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about a constructive dialog aiming at a just and lasting solution to the problem of Cyprus.As for the conflict between Iran and Iraq  we remain greatly concerned by the enormous loss of human life  the squandering of tremendous economic resources and the threats to regional peace and security involved. In this connection  all parties in a position to exert any positive influence on the belligerents should pool their efforts to prevail upon them to end the hostilities.Those and other confrontations  in addition to acts of terrorism  are only prolonging the sufferings of the peoples of the region. We reaffirm our solidarity with martyred Lebanon  the innocent victim of a situation that appears to be beyond its control.In the same context  there is the question of Palestine  which remains at the core of the Middle East conflict. We reaffirm our support for Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which recognizes as an essential element for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East the withdrawal ofIsrael from the occupied territories and acknowledgment of the right of every State In the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. We also support the legitimate demands of the Palestinian people  which  like all other peoples in the world  is entitled to its homeland.The picture would be incomplete were it confined solely to situations of armed confrontation without taking into account potential sources of tension or friction that could degenerate into conflict. As we know  the economic noose that is tightening around so many peoples is creating a flow of large numbers of emigrants to other shores and countries in search of a better life. Haiti has not escaped that situation.We are well aware of the difficulties created by this flood of emigrants without resources and of the problems it can cause the host countries. We are determined to continue to take steps to stop it. However  we vigorously protest against their maltreatment  harsh exploitation of their labor and the utter contempt with which they are all too often treated wherever they happen to end up.We appeal to the humanitarian sentiments of the peoples of the United Nations to respect the dignity of those starving castaways. Here  again  we should like to be able to count cm the experience and assistance of the competent agencies of the United Nations.Alongside those focal points of tension and conflict that it is possible to localize geographically  there exists another form of violence  which strikes all parts of the planet just when it is the least expected and the victims of which can be women  children  the elderly and the ailing. The Republic of Haiti vigorously condemns that unrestrained and blind violence which constitutes international terrorism and we call upon the international community to co-operate in fighting it and eliminating the causes likely to engender it.As we consider terrorism here  surely we should also consider the folly of the arms race. The world's arsenals are daily filling with terrifying weapons -chemical  biological and nuclear  as if conventional weapons were not enough. Mankind has imperceptibly become accustomed to the idea of an armed peace  of the balance of terror - there is even talk of invulnerable security - without realizing that the human race is being forced daily to live alongside means that are more than sufficient to wipe it off the face of the Earth.Space as well seems to be scheduled to become a theater for that operation of extermination  for terror must henceforth affect the whole world. We urgently appeal to the super-Powers to renounce this nuclear madness and to heed the voice of reason in order to stop this side of the point of no return that they are approaching at dizzying speed.We are gratified by the overtures recently made on both sides and we view with satisfaction and hope the manifestation of that willingness to talk which is undoubtedly the first step towards concerted action and solidarity. What is at stake is vital for humanity  for it is nothing less than the survival of us all.We call upon the super-Powers  under the aegis of the Organization  to come up with a realistic plan for balanced disarmament in order to make peace possible.The world.needs to devote all its resources - both human aid material - to solving the economic crisis which also is world wide. It affects all nations  the most highly developed as well as the least developed. But for the latter  its effects are devastating.In a market which they do not control  the prices of the developing countries' exports have been steadily falling. At the same time  those of their imports have steadily increased. Despite a significant drop  the oil bill remains prohibitive for the developing countries that do not produce oil. The result of this situation can be seen in an increasing balance of trade deficit which alone is capable of upsetting the fragile economy of the least advanced countries.If  with the sustained and non-inflationary growth recorded over the past four years in most of the industrialized coin tries  the risk of an aggravation of the crisis may seem to have been averted  the present situation none the less proves that it would be illusory to hope that the recovery in the North would alone be enough to create the fundamental conditions for accelerated development for the third world.Despite the undoubted improvements that can be seen notably in the perceptible progress in world trade and the drop in interest rates and inflation rates  statistics clearly show that apart from certain rare successes  there has in fact been no serious reduction in the degree of the crisis affecting the developing nations. Moreover  real per capita income remains at a standstill or has dropped  as is the case on the African continent  where it remains on the average at its 1970 level. In regard to Latin America  a recent report put out by the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) in April 1986 notes that the per capita gross domestic product in 1985 was no higher than in 1977.At the same time  with an average of 3 per cent of gross domestic product devoted to annual interest payments on its external debt  the third world has gradually entered into a true vicious circle  against which the weak measures adopted so far have proved ineffective. In brief  the development of scores of countries throughout the world has slowed down for the past 10 years  as is stressed in the 1985 Report on World Development put out by the world Bank.In this regard  the Haitian delegation must refer to the particularly alarming situation of the least developed countries which  because of their structural handicaps  remain the most vulnerable and are ultimately the most seriously affected by this state of affairs. The recent Substantial New Program of Action for the 1980s has  at the halfway stage  drawn up a report of bitter failure -two thirds of the least developed countries today have an income lower than that at the beginning of the decade. That program clearly demonstrated that if the international community did not urgently adopt the necessary measures to put the program fully into effect  that tendency towards decline in the economic situation of the least developed countries would become even worse and would have the most serious consequences for their people.It is time to call into question the structures of inequality  the failures of the machinery of international solidarity and the lack of political will  sometimes verging on indifference  as the result of which such setbacks have become possible. This leads us to wander what the final record of the Third United Nations Development Decade will be if fundamental changes and the appropriate and essential transfers of resources capable of infusing the third world countries with a new growth dynamic are not rapidly effected.In what measure will the international community be able to respond to these expectations? That is the crucial question we must answer in the conviction that any true solution lies in a new vision of interdependence  which would bring the developing countries into full association with the economic expansion and prosperity of the affluent countries and would in that regard promote a better balance at all levels of the North-South relationship.Finally  we cannot fail to mention the growing ravages of the international drug trade  to which there should be a rapid and effective response. The Government of the Republic of Haiti  for its part  is taking the necessary measures to combat this problem and is ready to take an active part in any international action aimed at eradicating it.These are all question which the United Nations is working tirelessly to solve and which would themselves alone justify an increase in its resources and the unreserved support of its Members.Of course  the limitation of its means can result only in the limitation of its action. For us  the small countries that benefit most from the Organization's assistance programs  the budgetary constraints imposed upon it are a source of grave concern  even alarm. The United Nations makes up for so many deficiencies -those that come from us ourselves and those that come from outside - and its role as an agent of progress and international co-operation is so well known that there is no need for me to dwell on it.In the final analysis  the Organization cannot respond effectively if we in the community of States lower the prestige of its organs by failures  by making excuses  by simply ignoring their recommendations and decisions  and by encroaching on their powers and competence  or if procedural subtleties or cleverness reduce the Organization's budget and thus its role in world affairs. None of us  large or small  stand to gain from that. Without a strong and effective United Nations  the situation in the world can only get worse. Let us rally round and revitalize the United Nations and restore to it the means to act so that it may realize its ideals of peace  justice  solidarity and progress.That is the challenge we must all help it to meet. That is the wish of my delegation."
"63",3101,"HUN",41,1986,"I should like first to join preceding speakers in congratulating Ambassador Choudhury of Bangladesh upon his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. He can rest assured of the constructive co-operation and support of the Hungarian delegation in his responsible work.May I recall that a year ago  on the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations  we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the activities of the Organization over the past decades and its role in the system of international politics. In ray view  the fact that on that occasion the representatives of Member States  including the Hungarian People's Republic  unanimously reaffirmed their countries' commitment to the principles and purposes enshrined in the United Nations Charter is of great significance for both the current session and the future of the Organization. At that time  we all expressed our interest and willingness to co-operate in the work of this unique and irreplaceable forum of world politics  guided as we were by this spirit in calling for efforts to increase its effectiveness and to enhance its prestige.The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is convinced that today the world Organization is faced with tasks that are even greater and more complex than the founders of the United Nations could foresee. To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war today means to prevent nuclear war  to save mankind as a whole  to ensure its survival and to preserve human civilization. It is our firm conviction that nuclear war can be avoided  anS the United Nations has a significant part to play in this regard. But the world Organization can fulfil its mission only if its Member States follow the path determined by the principles and purposes proclaimed at the time of its inception. In the current tense international situation this path cannot be the dangerous policy of confrontation  the continuation of the arms race  the expansion of unequal and discriminatory economic relations and  in general  the creation of conditions more unworthy of twentieth-century man than at any time during the past 40 years. We must advance along the path of equal and fruitful co-operation if we are to see the principles enshrined in the Charter prevail.My Government was guided precisely by the intention of implementing these very principles  by the need to create up-to-date conditions for the attainment of the lofty purposes embodied in them  and by the interdependence of the States of the world when  together with the Governments of nine other Member States  it addressed a letter to the Secretary-General proposing the inclusion on the agenda of the issue of establishing a comprehensive system of international peace and security. When we proposed the drawing up of a document summarizing the basic principles that are to govern the creation of a security system embracing all domains of international relations  we initiated joint efforts to lay the foundations of wide-ranging international co-operation  instead of confrontation and distrust  which still manifest themselves with recurrent frequency in inter-State relations. For we are convinced that in our age the security of no single State can be guaranteed to the detriment of others. Accordingly  we maintain that international security should also be conceived in its complexity  in its relationship to political  military  economic and humanitarian factors. This approach often requires the reappraisal of our earlier positions and  by adopting views in accord with the precepts of the time  a joint search for solutions to problems acceptable to all.An excellent framework for this pursuit is  in our view  provided by the activities of the United Nations which embrace nearly all fields of international co-operation  in which we have the opportunity to co-ordinate the interests of all States concerned.Trends towards confrontation and detente are simultaneously at work in international politics. The controversial international situation is fraught with grave tensions  while mankind is at the crossroads. We hope that the trend of detente and international co-operation will again prevail in the not too distant future. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is working towards that end. In these endeavors  it is encouraging for us to note that the world is becoming increasingly aware of the fact that contradictions and problems cannot be solved by the policy of force. We are therefore convinced that the forty-first session of the General Assembly will contribute considerably to strengthening thepositive trends in international politics.The prevailing world situation requires every Member State to redouble its efforts  for all countries have a duty to do everything they can to halt and reverse the unfavorable tendencies threatening the future of all mankind.In this regard the activities of the great Powers which bear specialresponsibility for the fate of the world are of outstanding significance.Therefore the international community welcomed the Geneva meeting last year of thetop leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States  which  in a sense  was thestarting point of some positive phenomena experienced since in Soviet-Americanrelations and in world politics in general. We continue to follow with greatattention and expectation the developments in those two countries' relations andhope that their contacts will finally lead in the not-too-distant future to anothersummit which will have a favorable impact on the future of mankind. We are convinced that tensions and distrust can be removed from the relations between the two great Powers only by constructive and substantive talks conducive to the redaction of the stockpiles of weapons  disarmament and broad co-operation based on mutual benefit.The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic is sincerely convinced that the initiatives of the Warsaw Treaty member States regarding the elimination of weapons of mass destruction by the end of this century and the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Europe provide a good basis for maintaining the military balance between the opposing systems of alliance at the lowest possible level. In order to start the process of reduction  all disarmament forums should be utilized and no single chance for mutually acceptable compromise must be missed.We consider the moratorium on nuclear tests unilaterally announced by the Soviet Union more than a year ago and extended several times since to be of outstanding importance in this context. It is encouraging to note that broad segments of the world public take a common stand in favor of the complete prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests on the one hand and against the stockpiling of different types of nuclear weapons and the extension of the arms race to outer space on the other. In our view this proves convincingly that the need for secure coexistence and co-operation among countries with different interests and social systems has become an imperative of our time. We believe that every Member State should recognize the urgent necessity of curbing the arms race and should act accordingly  in the interest of all mankind as well as of its own people. Therefore we earnestly hope that all States will respond in a constructive spirit to the challenges of the nuclear age and to our proposals aimed at meeting those challenges effectively.We are aware that the situation of various regions and groups of countries is considerably affected by the international political atmosphere and the general state of international relations  while naturally the international situation is also influenced by the development and problems of those regions. Hungary  like all other countries  cannot remain indifferent to the course of events in geographically distant countries and continents  since we feel the effects of those events indirectly in the overall international situation and directly in our bilateral relations. We are particularly concerned about the acute crisis situations in certain regions. The historical experience of the past four decades is proof that any conflict  local or regional  is bound to pose a grave threat to peace and security  not only in a particular region but also in the world at large. Hence the vital interests of all Member States of the United Nations require the settlement of such conflicts by peaceful means  by way of negotiations.Today it is more evident than ever before that there is no possibility of the just and lasting settlement of crisis situations other than through constructive negotiations with the participation of all the parties concerned.The Hungarian People's Republic stands ready to support any initiative towards the elimination of crisis situations. It is convinced that debates on those problems  in the United Nations also  should be characterized by a sincere collective search for solutions; by co-operation rather than confrontation. We believe that the arsenal of political means available for the solution of regional conflicts is far from being exhausted. It is in our common interest to seek newways and means in harmony with the generally accepted principles of international relations.This applies to all regional problems  including the Middle East crisis  the lasting and just solution of which could result from an international conference  held under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned  and preparations for such a conference should be started as soon as possible. It is also true of the Iraqi-Iranian conflict  the genuine solution of which is possible only if the senseless seven—year—long war is stopped by peaceful means without any delay  and of the situation around Afghanistan  where in our judgment  the chances of ending the hostilities have improved recently.The initiatives and efforts of the countries of South-East Asia hold out the hope that the region may become one of peace  co-operation and stability once its problems are solved through joint efforts. Acceptance of the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would likewise contribute to the creation of peace and security in the Korean peninsula and to the peaceful  democratic reunification of Korea. My Government lends full support to these proposals  as well as to declaring the region a nuclear—weapon—free zone.We view with increasing concern the latest crisis situation - perhaps one of the most acute of recent years - that in Central America and the Caribbean region  where tension has continued to grow and the acts threatening the sovereignty of the countries in that region have become more serious. We support the sincere pursuit of political solutions in the efforts of the Contadora Group. Encouragement of violence and armed intervention  whether direct or indirect  does not solve the problems but  on the contrary  aggravates the situation.The political and economic problems of Africa go far beyond the boundaries of the continent and can be remedied only by broad aid concerted international action. The United Nations and its specialized agencies  as well as the regional organizations  are actively working towards that end. Nevertheless  the situation in the southern part of Africa is becoming more and more dangerous.The world public unanimously and indignantly condemns the inhuman racist regime of South Africa  its extension to Namibia  which has been illegally occupied for 20 years  and Pretoria's acts of aggression against neighboring sovereign States aimed at destabilizing the region. My Government calls for the unconditional implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council on the independence of Namibia and for the speedy elimination of the apartheid regime  which practices serious  massive violation of human rights. We favor the introduction of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against racist South Africa and the implementation of the Program of action for the solution of the problems in the entire region.The international conventions on human rights  particularly the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  the twentieth anniversary of whose adoption is commemorated world-wide this year  are significant landmarks in co-operation within the framework of our world Organization.The exercise and protection of human rights in Hungary is a basic principle of my country's social system. We  for our part  promote respect for human rights by the development of our political institutions and legislation  by the constant extension of socialist democracy and by the fulfillment of our international obligations. He attach great importance to the efforts of the United Nations to eliminate massive  grave violations of human rights and to ensure the exercise of those rights. I should like to emphasize in this context that my Government has established very useful and constructive co-operation with the international bodies which monitor the implementation of international conventions and it believes that adherence to those conventions by as many States as possible would contribute greatly to the universal implementation of human rights. Universal implementation of human rights naturally implies the exercise and protection of the rights of nationalities as well. Full and equal participation of all the nationalities living in our country  in the political  economic and cultural life of our society  is an important component of national unity in Hungary. By guaranteeing institutional  democratic frameworks for their existence and the exercise of their collective rights  our State promotes the development of their sense of identity.Further development and strengthening of multilateral co-operation in human rights and in humanitarian and social issues can  in our view  contribute substantially to the creation of a comprehensive system of international security. It is a fact of life in our time that strengthening the security of States is inseparable from efforts aimed at the implementation of human rights  because the strengthening of international security is followed by the development of inter-State co-operation in the humanitarian field also  and in other spheres. In this endeavor the United Nations itself should continue to play a significant role.It is an important historical lesson of the past decades that the stronger the economic co-operation among the countries of the world with different social systems  the firmer the basis on which political relations can be built.Unfortunately  the current situation of the world economy gives no cause for optimism. Ways of averting the adverse effects of the world economic crisis are being sought by many and in many forms. We maintain that only solutions that are acceptable to all countries can be regarded as realistic  workable and constructive. This approach is dictated by our long-term common interest in an equitable and just restructuring of international economic relations  respecting the sovereignty and legitimate interests of all States. The United Nations and its specialized agencies are natural forums for such endeavors.The highly important documents adopted by these organizations provide an appropriate basis for the establishment of a system of international economic security. It is high time to initiate efforts to implement the democratic principles that should govern international economic relations  which could serve as a basis for a system based on mutual benefit  non-discrimination  and the principles and practice of mutual trust and reliability. Continuous accommodation of often considerably different economic and political interests is necessary if the world economy and its component parts  the national economies and the economic groups are to be capable of pursuing growth-oriented economic policies in favorable conditions.My country has a fundamental interest in the creation of a world economic environment that will ensure favorable conditions for the development of international economic co-operation. Such an environment would conduce to the attainment of our economic goals as well. This is yet another reason why we are ready  together with the other State Members of the United Nations  to accept any proposals and to adopt any measures likely to take us closer to the above-mentioned objectives.In view of its geographical situation  historical traditions and national circumstances  Hungary devotes particular attention to Europe. We are directly and deeply affected by European events  which  in a broader context  naturally form an integral part of world politics.The experience over a period of more than 10 years with the process of European security and co-operation fills us with hope. True  Europe has not yet seen a profound change in the relationship between the two opposing military-political groupings  and thus far it has been impossible to reduce the irrationally accumulated armed forces and stockpiles of armaments  including the most destructive nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction. But the intensity of crises of tension and their harmful consequences have somewhat lessened in relations among European States  and it was within the framework of this process that a significant agreement on reducing the risk of war in Europe was recently reached in Stockholm.Europe has attained a valuable body of experience in numerous areas of peaceful coexistence  interdependence and co-operation  based on confidence among States with different social systems. States belonging to different military alliances or States that are neutral or non-aligned. Hungary  too  has an excellent record of fruitful experience in this field. The Final Act signed in Helsinki in 1975 by the representatives of the 35 participating States has grown into a special system of East-West relations during the past 10 years. This system has proved  even under conditions of grave tensions during the past decade  that the community of interests is capable of dampening all kinds of differences  serious strains and crises of confidence. The experience gained is therefore also instructive with regard to the development of the whole world political situation.My country is interested in the continuation of the Helsinki process  and is doing its utmost to promote it. This was demonstrated by the successful organization of the Cultural Forum held in Budapest last fall and by the hundreds of proposals and recommendations submitted on that occasion by participating government delegates and cultural personalities. As regards the direction of the development of co-operation  we hold that all parties should seek to adopt a coherent interpretation of the Final Act  to maintain a balance of emphasis between the three baskets  and to implement the recommendations on a broad scale. The third follow-up meeting is soon to begin in Vienna  the capital city of neutral Austria. We earnestly hope that it will be a significant milestone in the further intensification of co-operation among the participating States. In this respect we believe it has become both necessary and possible for Europe to embark upon the road to actual disarmament. The proposals formulated in Budapest by the Warsaw Treaty member States concerning a can pr eh ens ive Program for the reduction of conventional armed forces and armaments in Europe are intended to further this end. We believe that these proposals are realistic  timely  and sufficiently flexible to provide a basis for the start of substantive negotiations. We dare to hope that the Budapest initiative will be instrumental in supplementing the political detente by a military one and will thereby acquire a significance similar to that of the Budapest Appeal of 1969  which led to the Helsinki Conference  a historic event in the life of our continent.I trust the foregoing has made it clear that the Hungarian People's Republic is shaping its foreign policy and international relations in the spirit of the United Nations Charter. Our immediate goal is to ensure the most favorable international conditions possible for our national construction. Consequently  we are striving to take an active share in the efforts aimed at preserving world peace and strengthening international security.We are seeking genuine co-operation in the political  economic  humanitarian and all other fields with all countries which are ready for such co-operation  which understand the importance of manifold international co-operation on the basis of respect both for each other's rights and interests and for good inter-State relations  and which realize that they have a vital interest in building broader and closer relations  in creating and strengthening confidence among States in all domains of international relations.The year 1986 is the International Year of Peace. Its appeal for mutual understanding and co-operation has aroused great attention in all countries of the globe  including my own. It is in this spirit that I assure the Assembly that the Hungarian delegation will adopt a constructive approach to all the issues to be discussed in the weeks ahead. It is ready to contribute all it can to the success of the deliberations of the General Assembly and to the efforts to ensure the success of the deliberations of the General Assembly and to the efforts to ensure that the forty-first session will bring tangible results in preserving world peace  improving the general political atmosphere and promoting international co-operation. "
"64",3148,"IDN",41,1986,"It is with genuine pleasure. Sir  that I extend my delegation's heartfelt congratulations to you on your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. To see such an eminent representative of a brotherly Asian country preside over our session is a source of particular satisfaction to us. Your election to this high office is well-deserved recognition of your personal qualities and accomplishments  as well as a fitting tribute to the role and stature of Bangladesh in world affairs.May I also extend a word of praise to your predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  for the impeccable manner in which he chaired the fortieth session  as well as the thirteenth special session  on the critical economic situation in Africa. His firm and enlightened leadership gained him the admiration of the entire Assembly.The highlight of the past year was  without question  the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on decolonization  which provided the international community with reason for some optimism and hope. The anniversary session appropriately focused the heightened attention of the world on our Organization  as representatives of Member States at the highest level converged to rededicate themselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter and to the strengthening of the United Nations for a better world.Since that historic event  the special session of the General Assembly  convened to address the critical economic situation in Africa  has dramatically demonstrated what can be achieved through the multilateral approach. It sharpened world-wide awareness of the awesome dimensions of the prolonged crisis. It alsosucceeded in injecting new urgency in addressing its underlying root causes and placed the firm support of the international community behind the African Priority program for Economic Recovery.Efforts to eliminate the last remnants of colonialism on our globe were further intensified by the successes achieved at the various international conferences sponsored by the United Nations and the holding of the fourteenth special session  on the question of Namibia  thus paving the way for the final triumph of the historical forces of justice and liberation.Efforts towards universal peace  peaceful coexistence and international co-operation were reinforced as representatives at the highest level from 101 non-aligned countries assembled early this month in Harare  Zimbabwe. They came away from the meeting with enhanced unity of purpose and strengthened resolve to continue to make their contributions to the central issues of disarmament  development and decolonization.Similarly  the summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev last November and the resumed negotiations on various aspects of nuclear disarmament between the two most heavily armed nations in the world were a source of renewed hope that rationality and global responsibility may yet prevail and succeed in stemming the ever upward spiraling arms race.Despite those major events and developments  however  the world community at all levels continues to experience a disquieting sense of uncertainty and generalized insecurity. The resolution of fundamental global issues remains bogged down by approaches that are tainted by mutual mistrust and narrow self-interest  which give rise to unilateralism and the politics of power and short-sighted expediency. The intractability of many problems has been compounded by a resurgence of great-Power contention and competition in the efforts to maintain or expand spheres of influence and domination. There has been no substantial progress in extinguishing the many regional hotbeds of conflict  which instead are being increasingly assigned East-West dimensions  thus widening the risk of enlarged conflagrations. Persistent resort to the threat or use of force in the settlement of disputes  aggression and racist oppression  intervention and economic coercion  have kept international tensions at undiminished levels  while posing a constant threat to the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States. And  overhanging all these disturbing trends is the dark cloud of the escalating arms race  especially in nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction  spurred on by strategic doctrines that purport to justify their existence and even their use.Crippling slow-downs in the development process and the steady erosion of multilaterialism and the multilateral framework of co-operation continue to be distinguishing features of the world economy and of international economic relations. In an increasingly integrated global economy  international development co-operation based on equity and genuine interdependence is eschewed in favor of a selective kind of bilateralism and sheer opportunism. As a direct consequence  the developing countries are plagued by economic stagnation and even regression. Their dire plight poses a real threat to the political stability and social cohesion of their societies  which in turn threatens the stability of the world at large.Of acute concern to the Assembly is the propensity of some Members to question the Organization's functions and programs and to reduce or withhold their assessed financial commitments  thereby seriously undercutting its role. At a time when so many pressing issues demand reaffirmation and reinvigoration of the multilateral process  we are  paradoxically  being confronted by attempts to weaken and curtail the role of the United Nations as the most appropriate universal forum for negotiations on and the solution of those issues. Indeed  the Organization is at present being subjected to an unprecedented challenge  not only to its solvency  but to its very viability.In brief  the world today is confronted by the incalculable risk of nuclear war and by continuing political turbulence and economic dislocation  especially in the developing regions of Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean. Our collective determination should therefore be directed towards the progressive establishment of a new world order based not on the competitive use of power but on the sovereign equality and genuine independence of all States. To act otherwise is to abdicate our collective responsibility and resolve to avert the irrational drift towards self-destruction through either self-inflicted nuclear annihilation or regression into international chaos and anarchy.Nowhere is this more apparent than in the field of disarmament and security  which remains the central preoccupation of our times. The excessive accumulation and refinement of weapons of mass destruction  both nuclear and conventional  01 land and sea have continued unabated and may now be extended to outer space as well. The threat of nuclear war is not simply one problem aMong the many the world is facing. The averting of nuclear catastrophe is the essential pre-condition of our endeavors to solve all other problems.As the largest coalition for peace in history  the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement  at their eighth summit meeting  held in Harare early this month  issued an urgent appeal to the major Powers reflecting the concern and anxiety of mankind about the possible outbreak of nuclear war and its attendant consequences. While the nuclear-weapon States must assume primary responsibility  every State has the right and duty to make its contribution to the adoption of effective measures to remove for all time the danger of nuclear war. Pending nuclear disarmament  the major Powers should heed the global demand that they forswear the use of nuclear weapons by international convention  ban all testing in all environments  halt and reverse the arms race and affirm the objective of common security through disarmament.Of growing concern to Indonesia is the fact that progress in the multilateral disarmament forums continues to be painfully slow and that too often stalemate in bilateral efforts has become a major impediment to such progress. Although some incremental gains have been made in the Conference on Disarmament  it has yet to fulfill its role as the sole negotiating machinery on all disarmament issues. The Conference on Disarmament should be allowed to initiate substantive negotiations in order to address the priority issues in a meaningful way.We have followed with close attention and measured hope the ongoing negotiations between the two major Powers. Despite faint indications of some movement  we have unfortunately seen little in the way of tangible progress so far. It is therefore necessary for the Assembly to call upon the United States and the Soviet Union to break the log-jam and translate their oft-repeated commitments into binding and durable agreements. The denial of justice  independence and human dignity continues to be a principal source of conflict and strife in many regions of the world. It is a matter of great urgency to ensure the speedy decolonization of Namibia and the eradication of apartheid. It is truly scandalous that  two decades after the United Nations assumed of direct responsibility over Namibia  racist South Africa continues its illegal occupation of the Territory. Despite concerted international efforts  prospects for the faithful implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence seem no better today than they did during last year's session. This is particularly deplorable in the light of the Secretary-General's conclusion that all issues relevant to the United Nations plan have been resolved and that  but for South Africa's insistence on injecting extraneous issues  it would have been possible to commence implementation.After waiting eight long years for the realization of the United Nations plan  the time for deliberation and persuasion is over. The Security Council must now demonstrate the political courage to act and to move forward with the implementation of its resolution 435 (1976)  without entertaining any modification or any further delaying tactics by South Africa. Namibia's decolonization cannot and should not any longer be held hostage to issues outside the terms of the United Nations plan  such as linkage with the presence of Cuban troops in Angola. We also reject all attempts to distort the question of Namibia by portraying it as an issue of East-West contention.As a member of the Council for Namibia since its inception  my Government has always attached the utmost importance to the Council's unique responsibilities of protecting and promoting the inalienable rights of the Namibian people and of ensuring the emergence of an independent Namibia with its territorial integrity and national unity intact. Indonesia also remains unswervingly committed to support the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  in the intensification of its just struggle  including armed struggle  for the liberation of Namibia.Indonesia views the deepening crisis in South Africa itself with utmost concern and anguish  kll indications show that after two years of unprecedented brutality and repression against the oppressed black majority  the racist regime has neither the inclination nor the ability to reduce the ever more violent polarization and  instead  continues to rely on the - indiscriminate application of brute force. Indeed  blinded by its frantic efforts to perpetuate the abhorrent system of apartheid  Pretoria is seemingly oblivious to the disastrous consequences of its self-destructive course which  has brought the situation in South Africa to the brink of an all-out civil war.My Government is convinced that the opportunity to avert a racial conflagration and to arrive at a peaceful end to apartheid may soon be lost unless the Security Council decides to act and to act decisively. It has long been abundantly clear to my delegation that the enforcement of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter may yet be our last option towards non-violent change in South Africa.While welcoming the recent decision of certain States to impose additional limited sanctions against South Africa  Indonesia views those piecemeal measures as still falling far short of coming to grips with the critical situation.therefore call on those States urgently to reassess their stand and acknowledge the dismal failure of the policy of ""constructive engagement"". Only through the complete isolation of apartheid South Africa can the principal objective of dismantling that inhuman system be assured and a non-racial  egalitarian and democratic society be built in its place.Peace and stability cannot coexist with apartheid and colonialism  not only in South Africa and Namibia  but indeed in the entire region of southern Africa. For the repeated acts of aggression  destabilization  subversion and terrorism perpetrated by Pretoria against the front-line and other neighboring African States reveal the ultimate hegemonistic designs of the racist regime on the region as a whole. Those States deserve increased assistance to overcome their vulnerability and economic dependence on South Africa.For the past three decades  Israel's aggressive and expansionist policies  its brutal record of repression of the Palestinian Arabs in the occupied territories and its desperate but vain attempts to destroy the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  both politically and physically  have been and continue to be the fundamental source of unabated violence and tensions in the Middle East. It is also most disturbing to observe that the major Powers continue to view the conflict primarily from the perspective of their own strategic designs on the region.The Indonesian Government and people remain steadfast in their firm support and solidarity with the just struggle of the Arab nation to regain its usurped rights and territories occupied since 1967. The question of Palestine lies at the core of the Middle East problem. A comprehensive  just and lasting solution  therefore  can be achieved only through the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the rights to self-determination and to establish their own independent and sovereign State in Palestine. Moreover  nosolution can be regarded as either comprehensive or just unless the PLO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  fully participates in its elaboration and implementation. Last but not least  stable peace and security can be based only on Israel's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories  including Jerusalem.We strongly believe that the most viable avenue towards resolving the various aspects of the conflict is through the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East. It is clear  however  that such a conference can be convened and succeed only with the support of the major Powers which must be prevailed upon to see its urgency and compelling logic. The alternative can only be further violence  bloodshed and suffering.Israel also continues to occupy sovereign Lebanese territory. The illegal presence of Israeli occupation troops in southern Lebanon is the principal cause of the worsening circumstances surrounding the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and has prevented UNIFIL from discharging the task assigned to it by the Security Council. Indonesia fully supports Lebanon's demand for the total withdrawal of all Israeli forces from its territory and for respect of its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.In the same region  we yearn for an end to the fratricidal conflict between Iran and Iraq and to the grievous human and material losses incurred by both sides. My delegation again appeals to our two brother nations to seek to resolve their differences in accordance with Charter principles so as to achieve a just and honorable settlement.Let me now turn to our own region's political and security concerns. Eight years after the outbreak of the conflict in Kampuchea  the tragic situation in that country continues to be the singular source of tension and instability in our part of the world. It also constitutes a major obstacle to our larger objective of transforming South-East Asia into an area of peace  regional harmony and prosperity. Our Organization has been rightly concerned over a conflict involving the violation of the cardinal principles of non-use of force and non-intervention in the internal affairs and the political and economic system of an independent State. Consequently  it has repeatedly reaffirmed the right of the people of Kampuchea to determine their own destiny free from foreign interference  subversion and coercion and has sought to promote negotiations and mutual understanding whereby a climate conducive to the exercise of that right would be created.For its part  the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has engaged in painstaking efforts to contribute to a settlement that would restore to the people of Kampuchea their rights  in accordance with internationally recognized principles.The Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea has also shown its readiness to consider any viable approach to a just and peaceful settlement. In this context  we welcome the eight-point proposal recently advanced by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea as it contains positive elements that can serve as a constructive framework for meaningful negotiations. The proposal is also consistent with ASEAN's .long-held view that essentially the Kampuchean problem has to be resolved by the Kampuchean people themselves.In our view  a genuinely independent and non-aligned Kampuchea  friendly to its neighbors and posing no threat to them remains an essential prerequisite of peace  stability and co-operation in the region. Despite the continuing impasse  ASEAN will not cease to explore all possible avenues and modalities for the restoration of the fundamental rights and interests of the Kampuchean people  while at the same time ensuring the legitimate interests of all countries to live in peace with one another  free from extra-regional threats and pressures.Yet another issue which calls for a political solution based on the withdrawal of foreign forces is the situation in Afghanistan. In the interest of restoring regional harmony and stability  Afghanistan should be allowed to resume its historic non-aligned role. In the South Pacific region  the Kanak people  under the leadership of the FLNKS  are engaged in a just struggle to attain independence for their country. Indonesia reiterates its support for self-determination and the early transition to an independent New Caledonia  in accordance with the rights and aspirations of the indigenous people and in a manner which guarantees the rights and the interests of all its inhabitants.It is encouraging that the process initiated and sustained by the Contadora Group  with the backing of its Support Group  has made steady progress in efforts to resolve  comprehensively and peacefully  the tensions arid strife that beset Central America. We welcome the substantive agreements already reached on the Final Version of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation. It is our sincere hope that the resolution of the remaining procedural and operational aspects will achieve early results. However  we cannot but express our concern over the increasing militarization of the region  the continuing external pressures and the interjection of ideological overtones and East-West rivalries into the conflict. Indonesia has always opposed external interference  whether through political destabilization  economic coercion or outright military intervention  in the struggle of developing countries to consolidate their national independence and to establish their own political  economic and social systems. Hence we have consistently supported Nicaragua in the defense of its right to self-determination  sovereign independence and territorial integrity.On the question of the Malvinas  my delegation appreciates the flexible and statesmanlike approach of Argentina in reaffirming its intention to comply with relevant General Assembly resolutions. We hope that negotiations will soon resume leading to a peaceful and definitive settlement of the sovereignty dispute.It is undeniable that peace and stability cannot be ensured in isolation from the state of the world economy and global economic relations. Neither can sustained development or an equitable economic system be secured in the absence of a stable and peaceful environment. Both are inextricably linked. As succinctly pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization: ""The common well-being of the world's population will depend heavily in the remaining years of this century on the success achieved in global development and in the reduction of the disparity in the conditions of life within the international community"".  Yet  in reviewing the current conditions in the world economy and in international economic relations  we see little grounds for optimism. On the contrary  the gap between the rich and the poor countries continues to widen  the global development crisis persists and the erosion in multilateral co-operation for development has not abated. Thus  for millions in the developing countries  grinding poverty is still a daily reality and the dream of a better future has turned into a nightmare of mere survival. Nor can we discern Letter prospects for the near future. To seek to understand and collectively resolve those reversals is the challenge and the responsibility of this General Assembly.The grim state of the world economy gives us no respite. The economic output of most developing countries has stagnated  trapping them in low levels of growth with little room for maneuver. The collapse of commodity prices and the disarray in commodity markets have delivered a damaging blow to their already depressed terms of trade. International trade  which has been a major instrument for development in the past and an effective channel for ensuring the mutual benefit of all nations has been blocked substantially by the rising tide of protectionism. These adverse factors  coupled with the severe contraction in both official and private financial flows  the alarming increase in debt-service burden and monetary instability  have resulted in the ironic phenomenon of a reverse transfer of resources  from developing to developed countries.The international economic system is still characterized by structural maladjustments. In consequence  it is the economically weak that sustain the brunt of the world economic reversals and thus suffer the most. Downward adjustments are forced on their vulnerable economies critically disrupting their development process.The ASEAN subregion  to which Indonesia belongs  represents a pertinent example. Despite strong economic resilience until recently  the pace of their development has now markedly declined. Nor has the Indonesian economy escaped the onslaughts of the adverse external environment. Its overall gross national product (GNP) growth has slowed severely in the last two years  while at the same time its debt-service ratio rose substantially. Indonesia was thus compelled to take a series of painful corrective measures  including the lowering of its development targets  drastic restraints in public investment  budgetary and import cut-backs  fiscal reforms and currency devaluation. Despite those measures the impact of the external environment has been such that economic growth remains tenuous. Caught in the vice of fiscal austerity and declining economic growth rates  Indonesia's ability to channel the internal pressures of almost 2 million annual entrants into its work-force and to absorb further external shocks has been greatly eroded.In this era of increasing interdependence  economic reversals cannot remain the preoccupation of the developing countries alone. While the adverse effects of inadequate development clearly translate into a reduced capacity of the developing countries to tackle their domestic difficulties and to participate beneficially in international economic activities  these effects will not for long be limited to the poorer countries. Inevitably  they will have an impact on the developed economies as well. Consequently  it is in the interest of all that theinternational community should work collectively and resolutely to transform the present and future challenges into successful opportunities.It is in this spirit that Indonesia views the launching of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations at Punta del Bste. As the beginning of a new concerted effort to halt and reverse the erosion of the international trading system  the new round should also provide us with an opportunity further to liberalize international trade. A mainstay of such liberalization should be the interests of the Developing countries  including the paramount principle of preferential treatment for them on a non-reciprocal basis. Likewise  we consider it most important that the present Assembly address the issue of external debt crisis and development. It is our hope that our discussions on this issue will be guided by the recognized principle of shared responsibility and the accepted policy of adjustment with growth and will effectively contribute to solving this problem. A timely opportunity is provided by the forthcoming seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII) to address key international issues in the fields of money  finance  trade and development and their interrelatedness. More important  we trust that UNCTAD VII will purposefully address the alarming commodity situation. What is critically needed are measures for properly managing commodity markets  stabilizing commodity prices and ensuring remunerative commodity earnings.As we move through the remaining years of this century there is no doubt that multiple economic challenges will continue to present a profound test of our collective will. There will be no ready answers nor easy solutions. Hence  there is no alternative for the international community but to marshal its collective determination and to work resolutely to reverse economic disparity and to ensure the success of global development.The international craBunity is today faced with an alarming rise in drug addiction and illicit narcotics trafficking  which poses a threat to the moral and ethical foundations of society and indeed the very security of many countries. Through the relentless efforts of this Organization  a consensus on the need for greater co-operation and co-ordination at the international and regional levels has been forged. The recent meeting of heads of national drug enforcement agencies in Vienna agreed on several important recommendations in this regard  thus providing valuable input for the International Conference in 1987. In preparation for that Conference  and within the context of regional co-operation  the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is formulating a strategy to address substantive issues and achieve concrete results. Indonesia  as a transit country for illicit narcotics trafficking  is acutely aware of the social and political implications of this problem. Through our national efforts and our work within ASEAN  as well as our strict adherence to the international conventions on narcotics  we have clearly demonstrated our resolve in combating this scourge.The proclamation of 1986 as the International Year of Peace  with its theme ""to safeguard peace and the future of humanity""  is clearly reflective of the most fundamental aspirations of men and women throughout the world  and the United Nations remains the principal multilateral framework devoted to its achievement. In this context Indonesia reaffirms its dedication and commitment to the primary objectives of the International Year of Peace  which are  inter alia  the promotion of universal peace  peaceful coexistence and co-operation and the prevention of war and conflict among nations. As we strive towards realization of those noble goals  let us also continue working towards improvement of the quality of life through the achievement of equality for women  increased respect for human rights and the right of peoples to development  and an end to racial discrimination and oppression.As these principles and objectives are embodied in the Indonesian Constitution and fully conform with the Indonesian national philosophy  our adherence is not only a moral obligation but a constitutional mandate.The United Nations is at present being confronted by a financial crisis of unprecedented proportions. Having temporarily averted the emergency aspects of the financial crisis at its resumed fortieth session  the General Assembly has now to address the longer-term problems by reviewing the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations. Indonesia recognizes that there is indeed room for improvements and greater economy in the workings of our Organization. We therefore welcome the report of the High-Level Group of 18 and stand ready to consider its valuable recommendations in a most positive spirit. At the same time  however  Indonesia believes that the crisis  which is essentially of a political nature  has reached a point where efficiency and rationalization measures alone will not suffice to provide a comprehensive and durable solution. This effort must be accompanied by a renewed commitment of explicit support to the United Nations by all Member States in accordance with their treaty obligations.No one can any longer envisage a world without the United Nations. We must sustain its many achievements and build upon them rather than engage in action that will only undermine its credibility and efficacy. In this the Secretary-General has demonstrated his astute understanding of the difficulties now besetting the Organization and has brought to bear his keen insight  consummate skills and personal dedication in seeking to overcome them. He hope that he will be enabled to continue his laudable efforts to strengthen the United Nations for a better worId.On its part  Indonesia pledges its unstinting support and full co-operation in the realization of this paramount objective."
"65",3195,"IND",41,1986,"At the outset. Sir  I extend to you once again the felicitations of my delegation on your assumption of the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly  it is a matter of immense pleasure for me and the rest of my delegation that a distinguished diplomat from a close and friendly neighbor country has been elected to that high office. You bring to your position rich and varied experience. We are confident that you will guide the deliberations of this Assembly with distinction.I also take this opportunity to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinie's  for his skillful leadership during the deliberations of the fortieth session of the General Assembly.I should like to convey our greetings to the Secretary-General  whom we are happy to see once again actively discharging his many onerous responsibilities. I hope that our Organization will continue to have the benefit of his experience and guidance for many years to come.In the past year the United Nations - indeed the entire multilateral system -has been subjected to severe strain and challenge. I am glad that  as he states in his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General has found notable unanimity in the recognition of the continuing validity of the principles of the United Nations Charter and the need to strengthen title United Nations so that it may better meet the needs of the future. India is a founder BSeaber and its allegiance to the Organization and commitment to the principles of the Charter remain firm and unswerving.As all of us are aware  the United Nations came into being in the wake of unparalleled death and destruction. The founding of the United Nations reflected the hopes and aspirations of humankind  which saw the need for a more rational world order. That vision is even more relevant today.The international situation remains tense. The nuclear arms race and its extension into outer space  conflicts around the world and the world economic crisis endanger peace and international security. Nuclear weapons no longer threaten only States and nations  they threaten the very survival of man. In her address at the seventh summit of non-aligned Heads of State or Government  in New Delhi in March 1983  Prime Minister Indira Gandhi warned that""Never before has our earth faced so much death and danger. The destructive power contained in nuclear stockpiles can kill human life  indeed all life  many times over and might well prevent its reappearance for ages to come.""  What is at stake is civilization itself.Last year  at the Geneva summit  the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States declared that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought. We call upon those two nations  which bear the major responsibility with regard to disarmament  to reinvigorate their dialog and take the logical follow-up steps to that assertion. We are glad that after a period of anxiety the two countriesappear to have resumed their efforts to make progress in this vital field. Their decisions will have consequences not only for their own peoples but for humanity as a whole. We trust that at their next meeting President Reagan aid General Secretary Gorbachev will reach important and meaningful agreements.Other nuclear-weapon States must not shirk their responsibility either. A decision on their part in favor of nuclear disarmament could only have a positive effect. They should no longer take shelter behind the position that they will disarm only if the two super-Powers do.Tl-e desire for peace is universal. There is increasing articulation of that feeling around the world  including in nuclear-weapon States  in legislatures and deliberative bodies  in universities and peace movements  aroong scientists and professionals - indeed  among all citizens.Early this month  Heads of State or Government assembled at Harare for the eighth summit of non-aligned nations appealed to the two most powerful nuclear-weapon States to arrest the trend towards confrontation and conflict. Earlier  the leaders participating in the six-nation  five-continent peace initiative urged an immediate moratorium on nuclear tests and offered a concrete Program of verification. A large number of Governments have welcomed this; many Parliaments have expressed enthusiasm and support. We welcome the positive response of the Soviet Union to the appeal by the Six in the Mexico Declaration by extending its unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing for a third time  now until January 1987. We hope the United States will respond positively.The United Nations has a unique role to play in all issues of disarmament. Regrettably  the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament have failed to bring about any positive steps on the vital issues of a nuclear test ban  the cessation of the nuclear arras race  nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war. It is thus more urgently necessary for the General Assembly to put forward new ideas and mobilize support for disarmament measures. Many issues that were before the United Nations at the time of its inception continue to linger on its agenda. Our pride in the freedom achieved by formerly dependent peoples is abridged by the failure to remove the last vestiges of colonialism in Africa and the still unfulfilled promise of a homeland for the Palestinian people.Last week we focused on Namibia at a special session of the General Assembly. Namibia  which is solely the responsibility of the United Nations  mirrors a situation where every value enshrined in the Charter stands challenged. ECforts towards freedom there have been continually frustrated by those who had concurred in the plan for independence of Namibia charted in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). This is the bitter twist of irony. Necessary consequent action by the Security Council has received support from all Members except those that have direct commercial stakes in the area and that also have the power to annul the collective will with their veto. It is not Namibia that is isolated; it is those who have sought to isolate Namibia that are.In South Africa apartheid survives and is the root cause of violence and instability in the region. Every initiative for a peaceful resolution has been rejected by the Pretoria regime. Since the last session of the General Assembly a major effort was made by the Commonwealth to bring about a dialog between the minority who rule and the majority who are ruled in South Africa. An Eminent Persons Group comprising distinguished personalities from seven Commonwealth countries visited South Africa for this purpose. However  the authorities in Pretoria live in a world all their own. Every meaningful proposal was spurned. The international community has no option but to impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against South Africa in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter as the only peaceful means to compel the South African regime to dismantle apartheid. The alternative would be too ghastly to contemplate.South Africa cannot withstand the tide of history. The abhorrent system of apartheid will collapse. In the words of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi:""Racism cannot last. People's aspirations cannot be uncaged in a prison. Nelson Mandela and his people will be free""-The presence of' great Powers continues to increase in the Indian Ocean. Formation of command structures and other forms of outside military presence and pressures negate the decision of the General Assembly to declare the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. The convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean at Colombo has been inordinately delayed because of the unhelpful attitude adopted by some. The Non-Aligned Movement has suggested 1988 as a finite target at which we must aim  and we hope the early convening of the Conference no longer remains an illusion.We remain deeply concerned over the situation in west Asia. The people of Palestine continue to languish without a homeland of their own. Israel's arrogant defiance of the will of the international community  the consolidation of its stranglehold over the occupied territories: all constitute sad chapters in a seemingly endless tragedy.We call for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967  including Jerusalem. We support the exercise of the right by the people of Palestine  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  to self-determination and the establishment of an independent sovereign State in Palestine. The right of all States in the region to live in peace within secure and recognized borders  including the independent State of Palestine  must be assured.We would like to underscore once again the importance of the early convening of the International Conference on the Middle East in accordance with General Assembly resolution 38/58 Cj that would constitute a major contribution by the United Nations towards the achievement of a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.The continuing conflict between Iran and Iraq causes us deep concern and anguish. Both these nations are heirs to great and proud civilizations. Both areendowed with the riches of nature and talented peoples. Yet for six long years death and destruction have prevented the channeling of their resources to productive activities. As a country which has friendly ties with both  we have had and shall continue to have close consultations with them to bring this tragic conflict to an end.Of late  we have seen a disturbing trend of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States by powerful nations. Nicaragua has the right to follow its national policies without outside intimidation or interference. All differences must be settled through negotiations. We have extended our full support to the Contadora process. Whether in Central America and the Caribbean or in the Mediterranean  the security and independence of non-aligned countries must be respected. No nation has the right to take the law into its own hands. Policies of domination must give way to greater understanding and respect for the aspirations of the States.Cyprus remains divided  with part of its territory under foreign occupation. We reiterate our solidarity with its people and reaffirm our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a non-aligned and unified Republic. We have noted the efforts made by the Secretary-General to bring about a satisfactory resolution of this issue.In relation to Afghanistan and South-West Asia  I reiterate that the situation can be resolved only through an overall political settlement based on the principles set out in the New Delhi Declaration. We support the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.The differences in South-East Asia call for a political solution. There can be no military solution  what is needed is a balanced approach that takes into account security and other considerations of all the countries in the region andeliminates outside interference. We urge all States in the region to undertake a dialog to resolve the differences and establish durable peace.The menace of terrorism is spreading. Assassinations  hijackings  bombings have meant the death of hundreds of men  women and children and have resulted in the loss of innocent lives  the mindless destruction of property and the jeopardizing of fundamental freedoms. I wish to reiterate the total opposition of my delegation to all acts of terrorism  whether committed by individuals  groups or States. All countries must co-operate in fighting this common scourge within the framework of internationally accepted norms.At the same time  we support the struggle of people under colonial and racist regimes and all forms of foreign domination and occupation and of the national liberation movements against their oppressors. Their struggle is legitimate and must not be confused with terrorism.The process of regional co-operation in South Asia  with which you  Mr. President  have such a close personal involvement  culminated in the formation of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC). The seven nations of the region  which face similar problems  are determined to nurture and foster this process of regional co-operation. SAARC will provide a vehicle for this purpose. India will have the privilege to serve as host to the second summit of SAARC leaders this November.Tensions and instability can arise also from the unsatisfactory state of the world economy. The economic situation continues to cause concern and is fraught with uncertainties which carry grave implications for the future   Expansion of world output and trade has slowed considerably  and developing countries in particular continue to be confronted with exceptionally difficult circumstances. Mechanisms of international co-operation which might have helped to mitigate their problems have been rendered largely ineffective. The international economic system remains inherently iniquitous.The developing countries have been urged to undertake drastic adjustments in the face of an unhelpful' international economic environment. Their efforts are hampered by intensified protectionist barriers  sharply declining prices of commodity exports and an increasingly intolerable debt burden. The severity of adjustment measures demanded of them has not only affected development prospects but has in many cases led to social and political tensions and unrest. Such adjustment to an adverse environment  which the developing countries have had no hand in shaping  really means accommodation by them to the policies and national interests of developed countries. There is thus a real danger that outside pressures may lead to an infringement of the economic sovereignty and be inimical to the political stability of developing countries. While it is obviously necessary for the developing countries to implement economic policies which will restore momentum to their economic growth  they must resolutely reject so-called solutions which would have the effect of undermining stable  democratic political structures.Along with the economic slow-down that has characterized the first half of this decade  there has been a marked change in the attitude of the developed countries  to the detriment of the interests of the developing countries. This attitude can be described as apathy with regard to the fundamental problems of poverty and development. It is  therefore  necessary to restate the basic consensus that has guided the international community in the post-war period; namely  that the development problem is a common concern of mankind and requires the co-operation of rich and poor nations alike. A retreat from that consensus and from the responsibilities associated with it will lead to an even deeper economic crisis. Enlightened co-operation in our interdependent world is no longer a luxury of choice but a necessity.The uncertainties of today can be turned into the opportunities of tomorrow. This would  however  require breathing new life into mechanisms and modalities of economic co-operation. On their part  the developing countries are ready in the most pragmatic and constructive spirit to resume such a dialog. In this context  we have noted with interest the proposal of the Secretary-General to convene a ministerial-level meeting of the Economic and Social Council to reach an agreement on the issues which need to be addressed most urgently. We are willing to explore all avenues which could lead to a resumption of meaningful dialog and co-operation in the areas of vital economic concern.The major economic imbalances which exist in the world economy also reflect the choices before us. If traditional approaches are continued  the vast surpluses and the corresponding deficits which are accumulating in some parts of the world could have a dangerous destabilizing effect. Alternatively  with bold and imaginative measures  they could be used to expand the productive capacity and the potentially vast markets of the developing countries  which could lead to a quantum increase in trade and growth rates around the globe. Low inflation rates and the benefits which industrial countries derive from the low commodity and energy prices should make it easier for them to undertake such measures. It is our firm belief that sustained growth in the world economy for the benefit of all would not be possible without a reactivation of the development momentum of developing countries. It is not sufficient merely to promote growth in the developed countries. Any significant improvement in the material conditions of life - which is the fundamental purpose of development - cannot come about entirely through the trickle-down effect of growth in industrial countries. We have to face the development issue squarely and evolve co-operative action to deal with it.The major imbalances in the world economy  the mounting burdens of external debt  the intensifying protectionism and the falling commodity prices reflect deeper structural deficiencies in the international economic order which need to be urgently addressed. In this regard  we support the proposal made by the Group of 24 in Washington to constitute a representative committee of ministers to examine further the different proposals for monetary improvement and reform. Such an examination could be an important preparatory process leading towards the convening of an international conference on money and finance for development. The forthcoming meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) would also provide an important opportunity to consider in an integrated and comprehensive manner the interrelated areas of money  finance  trade and development; and we would urge all countries to co-operate fully in reaching an early agreement on the agenda and other issues related to it. It is particularly important that the role and mandate of UNCTAD in dealing with trade and development policies should be pursued and further strengthened.In Punta del Este last week agreement was reached on the launching of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations to be called the Uruguay Round. We hope that these negotiations will result in the removal of protectionist barriers against the export products of developing countries.One of the most critical issues as regards the development problem in the years ahead was highlighted by the 1986 report of the United Nations Committee on Development Planning  namely  that developing countries face a serious financinggap over the next decade and that  without the restoration of development finance  prospects for growth would remain negligible and unable to satisfy even minimum aspirations for employment creation and higher living standards. We fully support the proposal of the eminent persons comprising the Committee on Development Planning for the doubling of development finance to provide an additional $25 billion per year  which they have contended is the minimum necessary condition for restoring moderate sustained growth in the developing world.The General Assembly has decided to put on its agenda a separate item entitled -External debt crisis and development"". This is an appropriate recognition of the severity of the debt and development crisis. Ke believe that in our search for a solution to this important issue measures to prevent the recurrence and spread of this problem should form an important element.The developing countries and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries remain deeply concerned about the critical economic situation in Africa. Within their capacities  the developing countries  including India  are doing their utmost to help the African countries overcome the critical situation. On earlier occasions ny delegation has outlined the concrete steps that we have taken. These are being continued and further expanded  in the context of the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  adopted by the General Assembly at its thirteenth special session  we shall continue to do our utmost to support the efforts of the African countries in areas where the skills and capabilities that we have acquired in our development experience have particular relevance.We are concerned that the current financial crisis facing the United Nations remains acute  despite the efforts made by many Member States to expedite their payments. Thus  the United Nations faces a situation in which it will not be able to carry out the work Program mandated by its legislative bodies. The crisis is above all a political crisis  arising from disregard for obligations flowing from the Charter and from lack of agreement among Member States on how to finance the Organization and its activities. We hope that wisdom will prevail and that a consensus will be achieved.At the same time  it is also necessary to pay due heed to economies which can be achieved without undermining the Organization itself. In that context  we express our appreciation of the work done by the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations. The United Nations must continue to play its vital role in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the promotion of development and international cooperation. We pledge our full oo-operation to that end.In his very first cress to the General Assembly Jawaharlal Nehru warned that it was becoming increasingly apparent that if we did not move with speed towards a world order  we should be left with order in the world. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar in his first report to the General Assembly similarly warned of the approach of a ""new international anarchy"". Nearly 40 years separate us from Jawaharlal Nehru's warning; only four years from the caution addressed to us by the Secretary General.But their strength and relevance endure. A stable world order my be one which is founded on ethics and international morality. Political stratagems divorced from morality may hold out the promise of short-term advantage  but they cannot provide the basis of any ensuring settlement. The durable world order to which we aspire must be based on justice  equity and mutual advantage. That is the goal to which the United Nations and all countries individually must dedicate themselves."
"66",3241,"IRL",41,1986,"I wish at the outset warmly to congratulate the President on his election to preside over the General Assembly at this forty-first session. I have every confidence that the depth of experience and range of skills he brings to his high office will contribute significantly to the Assembly's work at this session. We wish him every success in his endeavors.I wish also to express my appreciation of the efficiency and the dedicated manner in which Ambassador Jaime de Piniis of Spain carried out the duties of President during the fortieth session.Of course  like other representatives  I am also pleased to compliment the Secretary-General on his speedy recovery following his recent operation. I express to him our gratitude for his unflagging devotion and commitment to the Organization's ideals.Last year we came to the Assembly to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  founded  as the shadow of war was lifting from the planet  to renew the spirit of mankind  worn down by the turmoil of the previous upheavals. At this session we must begin the renewal of the Organization  so that in the decades ahead it can become  as it was conceived  the central instrument for the management of international relations. Our immediate priority is to take action  through a program of administrative and budgetary reform  to end the deepening crisis in the Organization's finances and to see to it that it is provided with the resources necessary to carry out all the responsibilities assigned to it under the Charter.As we commit our Organization to a process of reform  we  the Member States  must also renew our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter. The weakening of that commitment has impaired the United Nations in the discharge of its historic mission and has diminished public confidence in our affairs; the financial difficulties we must now surmount are no more than a symptom of that weakening of commitment.The circumstances of our world have greatly changed since the Charter was signed. The wartime alliances which brought the United Nations into being quickly fragmented under the pressure of the cold war  and the idealism which the Organization inspired at its foundation seemed to fade in the face of new rivalries and new priorities. The achievements of science  which have pushed out the frontiers of our knowledge  have forced us also to contemplate the nightmare of global destruction. A general war has been avoided in our time  but the cold calculations of deterrence which have helped to give us our uneasy peace have not brought with them any easy assurance of security. Peace and freedom remain the luxury of the few on the planet  where regional conflicts persist  where new tyrannies have arisen and where hunger  poverty and disease still thwart our best efforts to achieve a fairer world.In the face of these great changes and of continuing adversity  the Charter's promise of a new order  free from the scourge of war  based on respect for the dignity and worth of the human person and the rights of all nations  great and small  has gone unfulfilled. That should not  however  lead us to doubt the worth of the Organization or to call into question the purposes for which it was designed. It is precisely because the play of chance and human error  of avarice and folly  continues to perplex our nuclear age  just as it did in earlier but arguably less dangerous eras  that we require an organization through which we can strive to impose order on our troubled world and dull the edge of competition between our nations.As we debate in the Assembly how best the Organization can properly and more efficiently perform its role  we must not lose sight of what it has already achieved and may yet contribute in the service of mankind.It has put at the center of the international system universal standards of law and conduct and has made respect for these the first obligation of membership.It has provided a now almost universal forum where States can draw attention to their grievances and avail themselves of the mechanisms to hand for the conciliation of differences.Though regional wars have continued  many crises have been defused and wider conflict avoided through the good-offices role of the Secretary-General and the contribution of peace-keeping operations.It has nurtured the process of decolonization  which has seen over 100 States come to independence.It has established universal standards for respect for human rights to which all Member States must aspire  and it has sharpened vigilance in the detection of abuses of those rights.Through its specialized agencies it has pushed back the boundaries of famine  poverty  disease and underdevelopment  and it has housed and nourished those displaced by wars and other disasters.Why  then  is it that there are doubts and hesitations about the value of the Organization  with its incontestable record of achievement  at a time when the need for such a body was never more apparent? The Secretary-General in his annual reports has drawn attention to a crisis of confidence in the multilateral approach to international relations. Within the Organization this crisis reflects itself in the tendency of Member States to accept a whole-hearted commitment to some but not all of their Charter undertakings or to pursue their interests outside the framework of collective security  which is at the center of the Charter. It reflects itself also in the tendency of States to look to this Assembly for the satisfaction of short-term advantage only and to disregard the opportunities it offers for the more arduous and more critical work of building that consensus whichis the basis of progress. It is evidenced not least in the withholding by s number of Member States of their due contributions so that our present financial difficulties came to a head even as the Organization celebrated its fortieth year.This crisis of confidence in the multilateral approach has also been marked by growing criticism on the part of those who observe our affairs and who have become weary of what they see as a contradiction between promise and performance in our deliberations. Perhaps they ask of us hiyher standards than we are able to attain  but they remind us that the standards they expect are those which we have all accepted in subscribing to the Charter. Others point to the wasteful dissipation of our energy through duplication in our agenda  to a preoccupation with internal debates  to the neglect of practical solutions to the pressing problems of the outside world  to a tendency to single out for criticism a small number of countries while the misdeeds of others are seldom commented on. These criticisms may not do justice to the problems faced by a global institution made up of different peoples and regions which must seek a balance in the priority to be given to the issues of importance to each of its Members. However  since they are heard even from those who are in principle advocates of this Organization  they must give us cause for serious concern.I wish to make it clear that in my own country there remains a fundamental confidence in the work of this Organization. Commitment to the principles of the Charter is at the heart of Irish foreign policy. As a small nation which has experienced more than its fair share of the problems of division and conflict  we have a particular interest in the propagation and universal acceptance of the Charter's central tenet: the settlement of disputes between nations by peaceful means. We are also acutely aware that in this nuclear age no nation is immune to the dangers inherent in regional conflict. For while these conflicts have involved an appalling toll in the destruction of innocent lives and in the despoliation of needed resources they have at times also threatened wider escalation and brought the nuclear Powers perilously close to confrontation.If  as I believe  all Member States are agreed in the face of this overwhelming reality that we need the United Nations as the central instrument of order and co-operation in our nuclear age  we must be willing to take whatever steps are necessary to make it work and end the contradictions between promise and performance in our affairs. For  however we weigh the balances of success and failure of the United Nations  one thing is certain: the failings of this Organization are our own failings.The States assembled here are the United Nations. The success of this Organization in carrying out the responsibilities for which it was brought into being can be no greater than the effort each of us is prepared to make to fulfill the obligations of membership.Those obligations are real and substantive. They govern both the conduct of our relations with other States and our involvement in the structures of the Organization itself. Member States have a particular obligation to co-operate with the Security Council  which has been given primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. If the United Nations is to function at maximum effectiveness  the fullest possible support must also be given to the Secretary-General in accomplishing the many difficult but essential tasks which fall to him  not the least that of forging solutions to many of the regional conflicts that have been at the center of our deliberations.The States represented in this Assembly must also exert a greater effort in the resolution of the issues which come before us year after year.If I mention first East-West relations  it is because the relationship between the two great nuclear Powers is the overriding reality of international life that intrudes at every level in the work of the Organization. The Charter was conceived at a time when those great Powers had joined in common purpose. Today  long after the rupture of that coalition  competition between the super-Powers remains a central preoccupation of this Organization. Through its role in containing regional conflict  the United Nations has helped by acting as a regulator of the relationship between the two great nuclear Powers. But its contribution to crisis management can be effective only when both Powers are agreed on the scope and purpose of any action contemplated. Under the Charter  in virtue of their permanent membership of the Security Council  the Soviet Union and the United States have a special responsibility to promote international peace and security. It is therefore of the first importance that they meet that responsibility by availing themselves of every avenue for dialog and for the more effective management of their competition  so that tensions between them may be reduced.The improved climate of East-West relations during the past year offers grounds for continued  if moderate  optimism that a new spirit of co-operation between the Soviet Union and the United States may yet emerge. In particular  the summit meeting between President Reagan and Secretary Gorbachev of last November brought agreement to maintain regular contacts at both the political and the official level on important issues of concern. In spite of the serious differences which they acknowledged  the two leaders were able to identify some significant common ground as regards the approach to bilateral negotiations on nuclear and space weapons.We hope that the understandings then reached and the important meeting recently held between Secretary of State Shultz and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze will lead to substantial advances cm all aspects of their relations. If so  the positive effects will be felt within this Organization as well as in the East-West dialog and within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europa. As a means of highlighting the priority which arms control and disarmament must have in international affairs  the Assembly has designated the 1980s as the Second Disarmament Decade. looking back over the first half of this Decade  we cannot in truth conclude that it has led us any further away from the awesome threat of ever more sophisticated nuclear arsenals with their deadly potential to end life on this planet. I cite as just one example the fact that of the more than 1 000 nuclear explosions which have been detonated since the partial test ban Treaty came into effect in 1963  almost one quarter have taken place in the last five years alone.By contrast  however  with the disappointing results of recent years  there are indications that an advance might even yet be possible in the period ahead because of the improved prospects for negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union to which I have already referred. I would urge the leaders of these two powerful nations to pursue every possibility for agreement on substantial reductions of nuclear weapons  with a view to their eventual elimination. They must also ensure that outer space will never become the arena for a new arms race.There is unchallengeable evidence that chemical weapons are in use in contravention of the 1925 Geneva Protocol  and there are disturbing indications of growing interest in the acquisition of these weapons. The conclusion of an internationally binding and verifiable chemical weapons ban must therefore have the utmost priority  and I am happy to note encouraging signs of progress in the negotiations on a convention which are taking place at the Conference on Disarmament.In the last few days  the Stockholm Conference en Confidence- and Security-Building Measures has concluded its negotiations with a major agreement which will contribute significantly to the creation of an improved climate of security in Europe.I have used this podium previously to appeal to the nuclear-weapon States to undertake a commitment to halt the testing of nuclear weapons and to take steps to achieve a comprehensive test ban treaty. Such a prohibition will not eliminate nuclear weapons. But we are persuaded that it would constrain their further technical development and open the path to their reduction and elimination. As such it would be a credible demonstration of commitment by the nuclear-weapon States to their often-declared intention to eliminate nuclear weapons  and indeed a needed reassurance to the international community that its concerns have not gone unheeded.The development of the concept and the practice of peace-keeping has been one of the most remarkable and valuable achievements of the united Nations. Ireland is particularly honored to have had over 30 years a close involvement in this response by the United Nations to the management of regional conflicts. Through participation in observer and peace-keeping missions  we have sought to give practical expression to our commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes.In agreeing to the dispatch of troops on peace-keeping missions Irish Governments have been concerned to ensure satisfaction of a number of basic conditions necessary for the effective operation and security of the force concerned*  first  it should operate under a clear mandate from the Security Council and with the full support of its members*  secondly  it should enjoy the co-operation of the various parties to the conflicts; thirdly  it should operate on the basis of satisfactory financial arrangements. Judged against those criteria  the present situation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  on  which the Secretary General has in recent days reported to the Security Council can only give grounds for serious concern.Central to the problems confronting UNIFIL is its inability to implement the mandate given to it in Security Council resolution 425 (1978). The so-called security zone which Israel has insisted on maintaining has been the focus of resistance and confrontation which have led to dangerous escalation of violence on all sides. The loss of life and other casualties suffered by the Force in recent weeks bear testimony to the high price paid by the members of UN IF XL in the efforts to restore stability in that region and to carry out their duties impartially. Their current precarious position cannot be allowed to continue. It is imperative that murderous attacks on members of the United Nations Force should cease and that they should be allowed to discharge their mandate without further interference. Progress in this sense must be made immediately.I strongly endorse the Secretary-General's recommendation to the members of the Security Council  both collectively and individually  to take urgent action to unblock the present impasse and make substantial progress towards implementation of the mandate. I note that the Security Council has again seized itself of the matter in the last two days. All the parties concerned have once again been asked to co-operate in having the Force deployed to the southern border of Lebanon. This call must be heeded. The Secretary-General has been asked to make the necessary arrangements. It is important that he be assured of the full support of all Members of this Organization in his efforts. A clear demonstration by all Member States of their willingness to give full political support to the United Nations peace-keeping effort and to pay their assessed contributions is more necessary than ever before.Perhaps in no other area of United Nations activity is the gap between promise and performance more evident than in that of human rights. The United Nations has to its credit already accomplished much in this field by defining and codifying the common standards which all Governments must respect in virtue of their co-operation as Members of this Organization. The Universal Declaration  agreed only four years after the United Nations was founded  has been the basis for all that has subsequently been achieved. And yet if we look beyond these halls  beyond the debates we have held and the drafts we have argued over  sometimes for years until we have reached agreement  we find that the standards we have set and the protections we have envisaged are all too often spurned and that too many States still impose their authority in brutal disregard for the rights of the individual.I would suggest  therefore  that in the period ahead  if this work is to have concrete and lasting value  the united Nations might with profit concentrate on how best to ensure the widest possible implementation of the various international human rights instruments now in force. Nothing would do more to enhance the reputation and popular perception of the United Nations than the knowledge that its decisions and resolutions had a significant impact on the possibility for ordinary men and women to live out their lives in dignity and in freedom. We must therefore work to ensure that the machinery for the correction of abuses and for the investigation of grievances is developed so that individuals everywhere can have the confidence of redress where that is now denied.For a great part of mankind repression takes the form of hunger  disease and poverty. The human costs are immense. At the same time  the political consequences are becoming more evident as the stability of many developing countries is called into question by the mounting social and economic difficulties they have to face.Economic problems cannot be contained within national boundaries. Few countries today can escape the impact of economic decline  even in distant regions of the world. Individual States do not have it in their power either to avoid those problems or to devise solutions to them. Common action is not an option; it is a necessity.The focus for such efforts is provided by the multilateral framework of the United Nations  which thus has a key role to play in assisting the developing countries. The special session on Africa which took place earlier this year is an example of what can be achieved when Member States recognize the need for multilateral action and show the determination and pragmatism necessary to arrive at concrete and practical results.A major event on next year's United Nations agenda  and one for which preparations are now under way  is the Seventh United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. We attach great importance to that meeting. It will have a heavy agenda covering the basic issues  including resources for development and commodities  and will take account of the problems facing the least developed countries.One of the outstanding achievements of the fortieth session of the Assembly was the innovative and far-reaching agreement reached by Member States on measures to prevent international terrorism. Since that session  however  a number of European States  including some of our partner States in the Twelve  have sufferedfrom a barbarous onslaught of terrorist attacks. Other countries in other regions have also fallen victim to the terrorists' murderous intentions.Ireland and its European partners are determined to confront this renewed terrorist threat. In condemning such acts of terrorism we have emphasized that States which support or harbor terrorists cannot expect to maintain normal relations with our countries. We have also asked for the co-operation of other States Members of the Organization in our efforts to defeat terrorism and to isolate those who carry out such outrages. International terrorism is an affront and a challenge to all that the Organization stands for. Building  therefore  on the consensus we achieved at last year's session  we must now strengthen our co-operation and vigilance so as to ensure the elimination of this great evil.Progress in the priority areas that I have just identified - East-West relations  disarmament  peace-keeping  human rights  development and the prevention of international terrorism - would strengthen the role of the Organization and go some way towards achieving the goal of the founders of the United Nations. But it is also important that the United Nations should not lack the resources necessary to carry out its global responsibilities. A background of ever threatening financial crisis can only lead to the progressive paralysis of the Organization. The first requirement is that all Member States should pay their assessed contributions  which are obligatory under the Charter. This is central to any effort to place United Nations finances on a sound footing. It is also important that we make our Organization as efficient and as vigorous as possible. My delegation would like to congratulate the members of the High-Level Group on the report they have prepared  which represents a major contribution to the debate on the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations. In seeking change  we must take care that we do not upset the balance which the Charterstrikes between the interests of all nations represented here  great and small alike  in exercise of their sovereign equality. If we exercise this care  I am confident that we can more effectively equip the Organization to play in the decades ahead the indispensable role in international life which falls to it in virtue of the Charter.Most of the regional conflicts which we confront have persisted despite the efforts of the United Nations to point the way towards an agreed settlement and to offer its services to aid that outcome. All of them dramatize the futility of violence and all have brought intolerable hardship to the peoples involved. Through their co-operation the States members of the European Community have sought to lend their collective weight to the efforts of the Secretary-General and other interested parties to assist in the resolution of these conflicts  whether in Afghanistan  in Cyprus or in the Gulf. Yesterday my colleague  the British Foreign Secretary  reaffirmed the determination of the Twelve to continue their efforts to encourage a peaceful settlement of such conflicts. For my own part  I wish to address today the particular problems of three regions: the Middle East  southern Afr.ca and Central America.In Ireland we remain deeply concerned at the continuing failure to bring an end to the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors  a conflict whose instabilities have radiated far beyond the immediate region. We were encouraged in the past year by the opportunities which then seemed to be emerging from the agreement reached in February 1985 between Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The impasse that has since developed has  unfortunately  disappointed the many hopes to which that agreement once gave rise. More recently  we have followed with particular interest the renewed efforts by Egypt and Israel to find a peaceful resolution of their bilateral differences.A greater effort is now called for from the parties concerned and from the wider world community to ensure for the region as a whole a comprehensive and enduring peace. Our own approach to a settlement of that conflict is based on the Venice Declaration adopted by the States members of the European Community. Justice must be secured for the Palestinian people in accord with their right to self-determination. Israel also must be given the reassurance of security behind recognized frontiers.Lebanon has been the victim of the instabilities caused by the failure to find a settlement of the wide- conflict in the Middle East. The past year has involved further suffering and bloodshed for the divided communities of that land. We appeal to the Lebanese Government and to others in the country to continue in the vital task of bringing about national reconciliation. In so doing  we again recall the equally pressing need for restraint by forces outside the country. The territorial integrity  sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon must be respected if peace is to be secured.The continued worsening of the situation in South Africa over the past year j s a source of great dismay to the international community. Despite the drastic measures taken by the South African Administration to prevent the media reporting on events there  the attention of the world is focused as never before on the disastrous consequences of apartheid in all its manifestations. It is idle for the South African Government to claim  as it does  that it has embarked on a process of reform. Tinkering with the system is valueless if the basic structure of apartheid is left intact. That evil practice must be eradicated root and branch. The declaration of a state of emergency and the wholesale arrests and repressive measures taken under it clearly indicate that the South African Administration is not yet seriously intent on genuine reform or on commenting a meaningful political dialog with the authentic leaders of the black community.Progress requires that certain basic pre-conditions be met. These include the lifting of the state of emergency  the immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  the ending of the ban cm the African National Congress  the Pan African Congress and other political parties  and an end to detention without trial and forced relocation. It should be clear to all by now that only collective action by the international community will eventually persuade those holding power in South Africa to make a real commitment to abandon apartheid. For this reason Ireland favors the imposition by the Security Council of a set of mandatory sanctions against South Africa to be fully implemented by all. As a member of the European Community  we have consistently supported the introduction of joint measures to pressure South Africa to accept change and we shall continue to act with our partners in the Community in the interest of a further strengthening of its sanctions until real change is brought about.South Africa continues to defy international law and opinion elsewhere in the region. Its efforts to destabilize its neighbors have been condemned by Ireland and by the international community. The maneuvering of the South African Government in establishing the so-called transitional government of national unity in Namibia do not deceive world opinion and should be recognized for what they are: further obstacles in the way of independence for Namibia. The oily way forward is the immediate implementation by South Africa of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).It is dispiriting to note that in Central America the reflex of violence as a solution to the area's problems is still far too prevalent. Violence will not provide a solution to economic and social injustice. Only a firmer democracy will bring with it a greater assurance of justice to the people of the region  leading to a lessening of the burden of poverty and oppression which has affected too many of them for too long. A basic requirement of this development is peace. Thecountries of the area need peace  externally and internally. The best hope remains the efforts of the Central American States themselves. They have a right to look to others for their goodwill and encouragement. The Contadora process seemed to us a good augury. We are disappointed that that initiative has not resulted in the agreement which would be the foundation for lasting progress. We urge the Contadora States to renew their efforts  with the co-operation of the Support Group  to construct the framework for the enduring peace which the region so desperately needs. Ireland  as one of the Twelve  looks forward to the opportunity of providing active support to this process within the context of the Twelve's political dialog with Central America.For 18 years Ministers for Foreign Affairs of successive Irish Governments have informed the General Assembly each year in this debate of the situation in Northern Ireland. We have described the historic background to the instability of that part of Ireland and the underlying causes. We have stressed our sincere desire to find  with the British Government  a peaceful resolution of this issue. The present troubled phase goes bade to 1969  but this is only one phase of a  and difficult problem which involves the relationship of two Member States - Britain and Ireland - and the existence of two major traditions - unionist and nationalist - in the island of Ireland. We have reported to the General Assembly - and I do so once again today - not only because this is our single most important national problem but because the United Nations has a paramount role in the maintenance of world peace and security.Since I last addressed the Assembly a year ago there has been a major constructive development. On 15 November last at Hillsborough   in Northern Ireland  the Irish and British Governments signed a solemn  binding Agreement - the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985  Our Parliaments in Dublin and London debated and approved the Agreement  which entered into force on 29 November. Under Article 102 of the Charter  the representatives of our two Governments registered the Agreement on 20 December 1985 at the United Nations.The Agreement results from the commitment of two Members of this Organization to seek solutions to an issue of great common concern through negotiations. It results equally from a common rejection of any attempt to promote political objectives by violence or the threat of violence. It is particularly fitting that I should inform the Assembly about the Agreement in this the United Nations International Year of Peace.The Agreement was preceded by a long period of reflection and consultation on both sides. For our part  representatives of the constitutional nationalist parties in the whole of Ireland met formally in Dublin to consider the manner in which lasting peace and stability could be achieved. The New Ireland Forum Report of May 1984 contains the agreed result-  it was the basis for the position of my Government in the ensuing negotiations with the British Government.Both Governments entered into negotiations in the knowledge that it was in their joint interest to reach agreement. We had before us four main objectives. We wanted  through concerted action  to promote peace and stability in Northern Ireland. We wanted to help to reconcile the two major traditions - nationalist and unionist - in Ireland. We wanted to create a new climate of friendship between the peoples of Britain and Ireland. And we wanted to put an end to violence and terror.We set out to provide a framework for achieving peace  stability and reconciliation. We did not intend that the Agreement should produce ready-made solutions to a problem which dates back to the Anglo-Irish settlement of over 65 years ago  with origins deep in the past. But we were convinced that  if we could establish the right framework  solutions would come progressively and in time. The Anglo-Irish Agreement is the result.In its important first article the Agreement declares that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would cone about only with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. The present wish of a majority of the people there is for no change  but if in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland clearly wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland both Governments will introduce and support in their respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.For the first time an international agreement sets out plainly the legitimacy of the nationalist aspiration to a sovereign united Ireland achieved by peaceful means and through consent. At the same time the concerns of unionists are fully met by the assurance that there will be no change in the present status unless a majority in Northern Ireland so wishes.The Agreement provides for an Intergovernmental Conference as the means through which the Irish and British Governments have committed themselves to work together for specific objectives: accommodation of the rights and identities of the two traditions which exist in Northern Ireland and peace  stability and prosperity throughout the island of Ireland.For the first time in an international agreement the rights of the Irish Government to speak for the nationalists in the North has been recognized and provided for on a formal and continuing basis. For Northern nationalists  this gives new hope. The Irish Government in the Conference is their advocate.We will support the rights of nationalists in Northern Ireland and ensure  through the Conference  that those rights are fully acknowledged and accommodated. We want to see a society in which nationalists as well as unionists can live in peace  free from discrimination and intolerance and with the opportunity for both communities to participate in the structures and processes of Government. We also want to see - as soon as possible and through the co-operation of the constitutional political representatives in Northern Ireland - a devolved Government established there on a basis which has widespread support from both unionists and nationalists alike.The Anglo-Irish Agreement is an initiative by two Governments aimed at producing new positive political movement through joint action. It was carefully designed to meet a particular situation. Its form and implementing machinery are new and have no exact precedent in international affairs. Its architects  the two Governments  are committed to its success because it is in their vital interests to ensure that it does succeed.The Charter lays down as one of its purposes the development of friendly relations among nations. Between the Irish and British nations there is a unique relationship which derives from historical  cultural and ethnic links over many centuries and from close geographical proximity. We also share strong common beliefs in democratic principles and institutions  and today there is the common bond of our partnership in the European Community. The major unresolved issue between us has best Northern Ireland.I am confident that in the Anglo-Irish Agreement we have laid a sound foundation for progress towards reconciliation  peace and stability on the island of Ireland and for the closer development of relations  as friendly neighbors  between the British and the Irish peoples."
"67",3288,"IRN",41,1986," I have great pleasure in extending to Mr. Choudhury of Bangladesh our congratulations on his well-merited election as President of the General Assembly. I am confident that his wise guidance  as well as his cultural and intellectual experience  will enable this Assembly to become an initiator of decisions significant for the human community  decisions leading mankind to worship and obey one God and to prevent aggression and the domination of some by others.The intergovernmental and international infrastructure has undergone dramatic transformations  thanks to the development of modern communications. We are new faced with a new phenomenon  namely  the international community  or international family. Complicated links are formed among the members of this family  and the clash of their interests and motives has led to further sophistication. Meanwhile the United Nations is the only organ which can make a substantial contribution to the establishment of a wise and just order for this troubled international family. The crucial and heavy responsibility of this Organization  therefore  should not be undermined. In order to have a clear view of the path we must take in future and to correct our mistakes  we are obliged to consider the achievements of the United Nations in the past four decades in the light of the realities prevailing in the world today.Now  many people in the world pose the questions  ""what has the United Nations done so far?"" and ""what services has this Organization  with great publicity expenditure and structural changes  offered for the benefit of the international community?"" We are of the opinion that certain achievements have been made by this Organization.First  favorable ground has been established for international communications in all fields  from the political and economic to the cultural  scientific and technical. This has in turn helped to form the view of a unified international family for the whole of humanity regardless of differences in race  color  culture or language.Secondly  success has been achieved in combating colonialism. Resolution 1514 (XV) was a loud outcry by man against colonialism. Today colonialism no longer exists in most of the countries which have gained independence. This is a praiseworthy and valuable contribution.However  it is unfortunate that the old colonialism has been replaced by a more dangerous one  namely  neo-colonialism  which has forced many newly independent countries into yielding to the multi-faceted domination of powerful countries. It is of paramount importance that we go to the root causes of this problem and see why neo-colonialism has been so effective. There is no doubt that technical and industrial backwardness  coupled with economic underdevelopment  have been decisive in paving the way for the establishment of a new system pf domination and neo-colonialism. The efforts made by the United Nations in this respect have been substantial  although unsuccessfully in many cases. The creation of specialized agencies  the initiation of South-South co-operation and the adoptionof the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order have been among the most important and comprehensive of these initiatives.Although more than 12 years have passed since the adoption of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  it has not met with any success owing to the staunch opposition of the industrially developed countries. Under-development has paved the way for neo-colonialism. At the same time  the success of the big Powers in enslaving other nations has been due mainly to the fact that within the international community no just order prevails in relations to guarantee the national security  independence and territorial integrity of Member States. Today  the logic of force and the order of domination govern international relations  and it is for that reason that we should be concerned about international peace and security. The United Nations has not only been inactive in the face of such a threat  but it has even in many instances acquiesced in them.Today  the balance of power rather than the rule of law has been accepted as the basis and only possible method of safeguarding security  not only nationally  but regionally and globally as well. The recourse to the threat or use of force  aggression  the occupation of the lands of others by force and the infringement of sovereignty are all being utilized without being met by any serious opposition on the part of the United Nations and other international forums. We must acknowledge that in many instances the United Nations has even gone so far as to contribute to the legitimization of such methods. Is it not true that  in practice  the maintenance of the status quo and even submission to changed situations created by acts of aggression have become the general rule in international relations? Law based on human values and justice should play the determining role in relations among members of the international community.In this connection  the world arms race makes sense: it is a race to reach military superiority - qualitatively and quantitatively - in order to establish favorable situations through the use or threat of force.Another example of submission by the United Nations to the logic of force is inherent in its Charter and in the procedural mechanism of the Security Council. The Charter has an unjust tendency to preserve the interests of big Powers. A clear example is the notion that international peace and security should be safeguarded by the former Allied forces. Ironically  world peace is today imperiled by those very same Powers.The right to the veto is no more than a mockery of the international communityand has cast a shadow upon all the other gains and achievements of the Organization  which cannot take any practical and concrete step against oppression as long as the policy of submission to force is embodier in the Charter. The Council's bitter experience in recent years proves our claim. The United Nations has not taken any outstanding and effective action with regard to infringements of national sovereignty and independence in many countries  from Latin America to Africa  in the Middle East  Iran  Libya and Afghanistan. In some instances  we have even witnessed the Security Council openly seeking to save a defeated aggressor and have watched it go so far as to issue a communique in defense of that aggressor and against the victim.The situation that prevails is such that the existence of this mentality in the Security Council has led some of those with veto rights to attempt to employ financial leverage to carry the same rights over into the Assembly. What else can be the meaning of the American blackmail now being exerted? Is the Organization a corporation in which voting rights are determined in accordance with the nationalincome of each state Member  or is it a forum with the weighty responsibility of making decisions about international issues  a forum in which all Members enjoy equal voting rights? I hope the present session of the Assembly will give a clear and decisive answer to that question.If the United Nations is unable to fulfill its main objective - the preservation of the independence and territorial integrity of all Members and the maintenance of international peace and security - it should at least support those nations determined to resist aggression of any kind. That is the least we are entitled to expect from this international forum. Backing liberation movements and lending support to those countries that have gained independence through long years of struggle and popular revolutionary uprisings should constitute fundamental duties of the Organization. Should we not expect the United Nations to take up the crucial job of defending such young revolutionary States?One of the most vivid illustrations of my point is provided by the Islamic Revolution in Iran  which was subjected to various forms of pressure from the very beginning of its entering onto the path to victory. I do not intend to delve deeply into history at this juncture. The last disgraceful chapter of foreign domination in our country was opened by the coup engineered by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1953 and the return to power of the puppet re'gime of Pahlavi. The Iranian nation never submitted to that oppression  and it initiated a resistance that bore fruit in 1979.There is no need to mention here the fact that during the course of those two and a half decades of struggle thousands of the best of our country's sons sacrificed their lives for the sake of their lofty goals and nothing was immune from the clutches of the oppressors. Our natural resources were plundered*  our language and culture were metamorphosed and our economy grew ill and parasitic. The Islamic Revolution inspired a new movement within the Islamic world and among the down-trodden  with its message of resistance to any manifestation of domination. The lesson was a lesson of sacrifice in the cause of independence  justice and truth.This aroused concern among the Powers seeking domination  which began to engineer and foment plots and conspiracies. Various foreign-sponsored attempts at coups were foiled by the unified defense of the Muslim people and with Divine blessing. We even faced direct American military intervention in Tabas  followed by sanctions and a full-fledged propaganda war.All those conspiracies were nipped in the bud  but the United Nations took no effective and positive action. Does none of those crimes have anything to do with the fundamental duties of the Organization? Sometimes some event of limited magnitude gives risk to a great hue and cry in the Organization  which calls for a special session of the the General Assembly  an extraordinary meeting of the Security Council  giving rise to the adoption of resolutions  one after another  and to expressions of condemnation  regret and the like. But if Iran is subjected to foreign intervention  to naked aggression or to an economic blockade  nothing seems to take place. The long series of conspiracies finally led to an all-out Iraqi military aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran  and it has now been six years since its inception.There is no doubt that one of the most dastardly plots carried out against the Islamic Revolution is the full-fledged  premeditated Iraqi aggression against Iran. Since the Second World War  this is unprecedented in magnitude and in the military force employed. On 22 September 1980 over 12 Iraqi divisions and several independent brigades opened a blitzkrieg against Iran from land  sea and air. Civilians were taken prisoner by the invading forces. Tens of thousands of square kilometers of our land were occupied during the first days of the invasion. Several thousand cities and villages  large and small  were razed to the ground and some cities like Qasr-e-Shirin and Naft-e Shah are still occupied by Baathist troops.It is not hard to realize what are the main motives and purposes behind the invasion by the Iraqi regime. There is no need for complicated theories. It is sufficient to review the aggressor's attitude in the military  political and propaganda fields. The fact that the enemy troops advanced into the heart of our country as far as they could clearly shows that Iraq was not merely going to solve a border dispute unilaterally. The statements of the Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein  left no doubt that the Iraqi regime was seeking to overthrow the Islamic Republic of Iran. Maps published in Iraq  some of which are included in academic books  showing the annexation of parts of Iran are clear proof that the ruling regime in Iraq was determined to occupy a large part of our homeland. In other words  the Iran-Iraq war has been nothing but naked aggression to trample underfoot the independence  national sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country  in addition  it has been an invasion against a revolution.The timing of the aggression also deserves due attention. Iraq  in a simple and naive calculation  thought that Iran was shaky following its revolution  that the army had been dismantled because of revolutionary transformations  that the situation was unstable  and that therefore there was a golden opportunity for the regime in Iraq to take advantage of all those elements and invade Iran. The Iraqi regime then committed the crime with full confidence in victory and without the slightest fear of international forums. It was completely sure that the logic ruling in international relations would favor the aggression and make the new situation acceptable.Faced with such aggression  our nation had only two options*  either yielding to force and abandoning its revolution  dignity  independence and sovereignty or resisting the aggression. We did not receive our revolution as a gift from any of the Powers  it was  rather  the result of self-sacrifice and long years ofstruggle by thousands of men and women. Aggression against the revolution was tantamount to violating the very existence of every individual in our nation.From the first day of the invasion  when the enemy was at the peak of its feeling of superiority  to this day  when it is regretful and frustrated  we have kept saying one thing and have sought to translate it into action: the aggressor must be condemned and punished  and peace should be established between the two countries and in the region on the basis of justice.In the course of our sacred defense we have relied upon God Almighty and ourselves  and we shall continue to stand on our own feet. In conveying the result of this success to other nations facing aggression I say that the peoples of the world should rest assured that if they are determined to fight any aggression against their homeland  independence and national sovereignty they will secure victory  even if they are alone. Every aggressor  whether it be Hitler or Saddam  is doomed to the same destiny.The Iraqi regime not only has committed a crime against humanity and international peace by its military aggression  but also during the past six years has committed numerous war crimes  in defiance of all the norms of international law. It is regrettable that although a United Nations report explicitly referred to the physical abuse of Iranian prisoners-of-war in Iraqi camps and made recommendations  no change has occurred in that regard. Attacks on civilian quarters and the war on cities  resulting in the martyrdom of thousands of men  women and children  constitute another war crime in Iraq's long list of violations of international law. The agreement of 12 June 1984 did not last long and the Iraqi regime again resumed attacks on residential areas  as stated in United Nations documents. That crime is continuing today.Attacks on civilian airliners are rare. The international community has seen a Government openly and officially issue a note of 17 March 1985 and in practice resort to that notorious crime. The latest incident was the shooting down of a civilian airliner of Asseman Airlines over the southern Iran city of Ahwaz  when 40 passengers were brutally murdered.Another inhuman crime committed by Iraq is the repeated use of chemical weapons. Following the distribution of the united Nations reports of 1984 and 1985 in which the use of chemical weapons was confirmed  it was openly stated in document S/17911  which reflected the observations of the Secretary-General's team in Khuzestan Province  that Iraq had used chemical weapons repeatedly and extensively. The report constitutes an important international document  and this is the first recorded case since the creation of the United Nations of a report on violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 in which the violating country is clearly named. Unfortunately  due attention has not been paid to that important document. Although some Western countries and a group of their allies  as well as some non-aligned and Islamic countries  such as Pakistan  have adopted positions in the face of that Iraqi crime  and although the Security Council  in its statement of 21 March 1986  condemned the Iraqi regime  no position comparable to the dimensions of the inhuman acts committed by Iraq has yet been adopted. Consequently  since the Security Council statement was issued  Iraq has on five occasions - on 22 and 23 March and in April and May 1986 - deployed chemical weapons both on the battlefield and against civilian areas.The Security Council has a heavy responsibility vis-a-vis the problem. If a small country such as Iraq can permit itself heedlessly to violate one of the most important international conventions  now again before the Conference on Disarmament  what is to guarantee other existing or future conventions? The international community expects the Security Council to adopt a resolution once again condemning the Iraqi regime's continued use of chemical weapons and openly urging the regime to pay due attention to the matter. The Council should also call on all countries strictly to refrain from the export to Iraq of such chemicals and know-how as can be used for the manufacture of chemical weapons.It should also apply strict regulations in the case of anyone who refuses to comply with such universal demands. In addition  taking into account the impact of Iraq's repeated use of chemical weapons and the consequent weakening of the 1925 Protocol  all countries should be urged to call for the implementation of the provisions of that Protocol.Another especially important task that should be carried out by the United Nations is the conduct of the necessary investigations to determine the source of the supplies of chemical weapons to Iraq. There is  of course  a slight probability that mustard gas is produced in Iraq with imported substances  but nerve gas  use of which was confirmed in the United Nations report of 1984  is a complicated chemical weapon and is most definitely supplied to Iran by those countries that possess the technology. We have evidence enough to prove that.Let me take this opportunity to touch upon one of the main shortcomings of the present international order. The Charter of the United Nations entrusts the Security Council  within the framework of political regulations and relations  with the responsibility of dealing with violations of international laws and regulations that endanger world peace and security. Unfortunately the international community lacks an independent and strong judicial body  and the International Court of Justice does not have a well calibrated and automatic duty in this regard. In any country  as soon as a crime is committed the judicial body goes after the perpetrator  whether a personal complaint is lodged or not. But on the international scene  the way of dealing with violations or crimes against peace and humanity is at best limited to political condemnation. Which judicial organ is responsible for the investigation of the Iraqi violation of international law? We are of the opinion that the International Court of Justice seated in The Hague  for instance  should deal independently with Iraqi infringement of the 1925 Geneva Protocol  no matter whether Iran files a complaint or not. We sincerely hope that those who wish international relations well will seriously seek to overcome this shortcoming and present practical proposals in this connection.There is no doubt that the naked aggression carried out by the regime ruling over Iraq against the Islamic Republic of Iran  which has entered its seventh year  and the repercussions of that aggression have imperiled regional security and presented a serious threat to international peace. Today the war is one of the gravest issues facing the international community  and the attitudes of States with regard to it can be divided into three categories.The first category comprises those countries that have extended their utmost support to Iraq by providing lethal weapons and economic and financial help as well as political assistance. They include primarily the super-Powers and their cronies  which resort to deceitful rhetoric and slogans  saying ""Bloodshed is abhorred by mankind; you should seek to solve your problems through negotiated peaceful means."" In practice they themselves give unabated and relentless support to the aggressor  thus contributing to the prolongation of the war. Had our disputes been territorial or financial  negotiations would have made sense. But Iraq initiated the war to topple the legitimate Government  which came to power through a popular uprising. They did whatever they could. Nobody would be so naive as to sit at the same table with such aggressors. The only thing that concerns those Powers  it seems  is to find a way to save the defeated enemy. In the meantime  none of these recommendations forced the occupation forces out of our territories. Our people had to assume the task themselves. I sincerely ask the Secretary-General  the President and all the representatives to show us even one instance in which the Iraqis withdrew from even one part of the occupied lands through a unilateral initiative. We recovered our lost territory inch by inch atthe cost of the blood of our loved ones. In this context  not even the most naive of simpletons could say that Iraq had peaceful aspirations. Allow me to be more direct here. The Islamic Revolution established in Iran a system free of domination by the super-Powers after Iran had been turned into a stronghold of American domination in the region. The policy of non-alignment is being carried out and experienced in the true sense of the word in the Islamic Republic  and other countries are gradually coming to understand this situation better and are becoming more sympathetic towards it. Those who support the Iraqi regime are motivated by their desire to counter such a trend.The second category comprises those countries that have adopted a neutral stance towards the two countries by expressing abhorrence of the war and the bloodshed. Our question to those countries is this: If their own lands had been trampled by foreign invaders  what position would they have expected others to take? Would they not at the very least expect condemnation of the aggressor and a call for its punishment? Moreover they should not make a distinction between themselves and other members of the international community. These friends should know that if aggression is legitimized and the aggressors come to realize there is always a way to escape the consequences of their crime  we should expect further invasions. Those countries  then  increase their own chances of becoming prey to aggression. On the other hand  it is not possible to live in an international community without accepting responsibility  and all members are in duty bound to contribute to the preservation of international peace and security. As aggression poses the most dangerous threat to peace and security  it is the part of wisdom to condemn and punish the aggressor in order to save world peace.The third category includes those countries that have during the course of the imposed war gradually moved towards a position of justice. That is praiseworthy  but more effective momentum is needed. At the same time  since this represents amovement towards justice  it should not be manifested solely in bilateral relations. We place greater priority on adherence to international principles based on justice than on the strengthening of bilateral relations. Condemnation of the initiator of aggression responds to the expectations of a nation that has been victimized; but  more than that  it will respond to the conscience of human society.We believe that the war is drawing towards an end with the punishment of the aggressor regime of Iraq. This will be a positive step for peace in the region and ultimately in the entire international community. For those countries and organizations that have failed to fulfill their obligations in regard to the Iraqi aggression there is little time left to make up for the past. We declare here that according to all international law and regulations  responsibility for the war cannot be divided. To refer to the initiation of the war and its continuation as two independent responsibilities and a legal situation is contradictory to the most fundamental of international principles. Iraq is responsible for the war - both for its initiation and for its continuation: and  of course  those who have continued to support Iraq are also accomplices of the Iraqi regime.More time would be needed to go into the details of the chronicle of the imposed war and the crimes committed during the course of it. In addition  we believe that the important point  which deserves due attention by this forum  is the future of the sensitive  important and strategic Persian Gulf region. Our region is in no way able to tolerate another devastating war. The Iraqi-imposed war destroyed vast  valuable resources in our region. All the countries in the area must be able to mobilize the possibilities available to make arrangements for the establishment of a durable and permanent peace that guarantees regional security  as well as the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of each individual State. There are encouraging signs now that reflect the possibility of establishing strong friendly relations among the countries of the region. We should strengthen these hopes and contribute to their fulfillment. We are fully prepared to make our contribution now in the interests of the long-run strategic security of the region.There is no doubt that this end cannot be achieved unilaterally  but if those States prefer to continue to support the doomed rlgime of Saddam Hussein  rather than consider such arrangements  they are putting their own national interests in jeopardy. With the elimination of the roots of aggression  our nation and region will possess all the factors and elements needed for the establishment of lasting peace. One of the most crucial tasks of our countries is to achieve this position and as soon as we have we shall be able to eradicate the sources of foreign intervention.Planning for future security is not merely confined to the Persian Gulf. It is also necessary in connection with the continued occupation of Afghanistan by Soviet troops  which has unfortunately created a climate of rising tension in theregion  endangering its peace and security. As stated by the Islamic Republic of Iran at the outset  the Geneva talks not only failed to break this impasse  but provided a pretext for the presence of the occupation forces and deception of international public opinion  and this has had adverse effects on the Afghan situation. It is now more clear than ever that the occupation of Afghanistan  which took place under the pretext of solving the problem of the Afghan people caused by foreign threats  has itself imposed a greater burden on the downtrodden people of that land. To make the situation even worse  it has provided suitable grounds for the Western Powers' strengthening their presence in the region.Our regional security can no longer be held hostage to super-Power rivalry. The Afghan issue cannot be solved in the context of the interests of a super-Power. The just conditions set forth by the Islamic Republic of Iran are more valid than ever. The unconditional and immediate withdrawal of the occupation forces  recognition of the Afghan people's right to self-determination  voluntary repatriation of Afghan refugees and non-intervention by foreigners in the internal affairs of Afghanistan must constitute the essence of any solution to that country's problems. Afghanistan is in dire need of stability  which can be achieved only through the establishment of an independent  non-aligned Government  that enjoys the support of the majority of the population. It is natural that the foreign policy of such a Government would require friendly relations with all regional countries and good-neighborliness.Because of the direct impact of the situation in Afghanistan on our national security and the practical problems it causes for our country  such as the continuing influx of Afghan refugees  we follow the situation carefully and with great concern. Our country  in spite of the Herculean problems it faces emanating from the sensitive and historical situation  is sheltering nearly 2 million Afghanrefugees. At the same time  it is the international duty of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to deal with this matter more seriously  it is evident that any success in this field will be possible only through the more active participation of all countries.If Afghan refugees still nourish in their hearts the hope of one day returning to their homeland  for Palestinians such a hope is gradually fading. In 1967 and 1973 attempts were made to strengthen the idea of an all-out struggle against the occupation regime in Palestine  but today  with the divisions among Arabs and within the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  one hardly hears about such struggles  even in slogans. The treacherous Camp David Accord has unfortunately left its impact on some Arab and Palestinian leaders and  except in a few countries in the front line of the struggle against Israel  the policy of appeasement has become the dominant policy in our region. The appeal of certain independent countries  and some from the United Nations who formally claimed to be part of the anti-Zionist struggle  for Israel to recognize the PLO as a party to talks constitutes an insult to 40 years of struggle by the people of Palestine.The treacherous act of the King of Morocco  who issued an invitation to the Prime Minister of the regime occupying Palestine  greatly contributed to the advancement of the compromise process. The Fez plan is based on a position that can lead only to the further entrenchment of Israel in occupied territories. The visit of Peres to Morocco  which took place under the pretext of the Fez plan  could be the beginning of a sad end to the Palestinian destiny if there is not firm resistance by the people of Palestine and non-aligned Arab and Muslim countries. In the present circumstances  in which the whole of Palestine and major parts of Arab countries are under Israeli occupation  any compromise move which increases hope of the continued existence of a Zionist regime will cause immense increases inUnited States economic aid to  and political  military and arms support for  Israel  in accordance with their strategic alliance. Thus  Israel continues to exist not as a State but as the greatest United States political  economic  military and even nuclear base in the Middle East. This will certainly constitute an ever increasing threat to peace  security and stability in the sensitive Middle East region.For this very reason  we cannot accept any peace plan that includes direct or indirect recognition of the Zionist entity.To those who believe that the establishment of an international conference advocating recognition of the PLO by Israel and the United States will secure the political interests of Palestine  I wish to say that only through the struggle against the occupying regime in Palestine can Palestine regain its freedom. A conference between the aggressor and the victim is another way of compromising with Zionism.The question of Palestine is at the root of the Middle East crises. Therefore  a short-term settlement could only aggravate the situation. A just and comprehensive peace can be realized in this region only after the expulsion of Israel from Palestine and all Arab lands and the return of Palestinians to their homeland to establish an independent State therein.The heroic experience of the Muslim people of Lebanon in struggling against the Israeli occupiers and expelling them from the major part of their homeland should be a good lesson for those who consider compromise to be the only option for the Middle East. In conditions that enabled Israel to entertain the thought that it had finished Lebanon and could include it in the list of its occupied and annexed territories  the people of Lebanon started a great mass movement thatforced Israel and its supporters to withdraw. It is true that Lebanon  owing to certain internal differences and disruptions caused by the war  has not yet been able to establish comprehensive  strongly based security  but the Zionist regime will never again dare to encroach upon that land.We declare our full support for the security and territorial integrity of Lebanon within its internationally recognized borders  and we uphold the right of its people to exercise full sovereignty over the whole country. We are confident that the people of Lebanon will be able to expel the remaining occupation forces from their homeland. Moreover  we call on the United Nations  in keeping with the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949  to protect the civilian population of this country from the barbarous and inhuman acts of the occupation forces.Special attention should also be paid to the efforts made by the Zionist regime that threaten the security of African countries and are aimed at expanding its influence in this tyrannized continent. Israel's co-operation with the racist regime of South Africa is rapidly expanding in the economic  military and nuclear fields. We strongly caution that the establishment of relations between some African countries and the Zionist regime will strengthen the foundations of the apartheid regime. We propose that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) take urgent measures to uproot this cancerous tumor from their continent.Unlike the question of Palestine that is suffering from division  difference of opinion and compromising policies  a consensus exists among all countries - with few exceptions - on the question of South Africa. This consensus  which is accompanied by extensive movements especially at the international level  has laid the groundwork for the intensification of the pressures being exerted on the racist regime of South Africa.The various gatherings that have been convened throughout the world - such as the meetings in London recommending military sanctions and in Oslo recommending oil sanctions  as well as the international conference in Paris on sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa  followed by the OAU summit in Addis Ababa and the Non-Aligned Conference in Harare  Zimbabwe - all have contributed to theimplementation of the resolutions on South Africa adopted by the United Nations and other international organizations.The Non-Aligned Conference in Harare adopted certain practical and concrete proposals. The proposal made by the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the establishment of a fund to help the combatants inside South Africa  the fund for the front-line States and other similar proposals should receive the prompt support of the United Nations and of all Member States. The present session of the General Assembly should enhance such activities. The intensification of the struggle of the people of South Africa is promising serious changes in Pretoria.The racist regime of South Africa is indisputably the root cause of all the tensions in South Africa. So long as apartheid is not totally eliminated peace  stability and security cannot be established in this region. People in South Africa should enjoy the right to a system composed of all races  with equal voting rights for everyone regardless of race and color of skin. The very idea of apartheid constitutes a crime against humankind and an insult to the world's conscience. With such a definition of apartheid in mind  one ask why the countries that fought during the Second World War against a similar notion  are not now ready to cease supporting the apartheid regime. Is there any justification for the United States policy of ""constructive engagement"" - a policy aimed at protecting the racist regime of South Africa and safeguarding United States national interests?In addition to crimes committed within its own borders  the apartheid rlgime is spreading its crimes to other States in southern Africa through subversive and terrorist acts  and the dispatch of paid agents to those countries. During the past year  these acts were intensified especially against Mozambique and Angola. The regime of South Africa is still encroaching upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lesotho and Botswana. Air raids and economic pressure  aswell as subversive acts carried out against Zimbabwe  Tanzania and Swaziland are all indicative of the fact that the regime in South Africa will never voluntarily submit to international decisions.The illegal  colonial occupation of Namibia by the South African regime  which is recognized as aggression against the people of Namibia  is continuing. Bight years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  calling for the independence of Namibia  there has been no practical progress for its implementation. Once again we voice our condemnation of the racist regime of South Africa  and reaffirm the inalienable right of the people of Namibia to national independence  self-determination  and the territorial integrity of their homeland. On the other hand  we believe that the Namibian people's armed struggle  led by the South west Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  should continue and be strengthened. The decision adopted at the Vienna International Conference for the Immediate Independence of Namibia  and the recent special session of the General Assembly on Namibia  should be given due attention by all countries. The Islamic Republic of Iran has encouraged the opening of a SWAPO representation office in Tehran. Similarly  political support for SWAPO should be continued at the international level.We believe that the internal struggle in South Africa should be strengthened and that more pressure should be applied on the regime there through invoking Chapter VII of the Charter and implementing Security Council resolution 283 (1970)  calling for the imposition of political  economic  military  nuclear  cultural and sport sanctions on the South African regime. Unfortunately  the uncooperative approach of certain Western countries is the principal cause for the continuation of apartheid and the regime's occupation of Namibia and acts of sabotage and conspiracies against its  neighbors.There is no doubt that despite such manipulation  the racist regime of South Africa cannot be kept in power for long  disregarding the desire of the whole people of south Africa and Namibia. Those who sacrifice humanitarian principles for the sake of their personal financial interests will finally end up in disgrace.Latin America and the Caribbean region are still suffering from the vestiges of dependent military governments  huge economic difficulties and encroachment upon their sovereignty  in the past year  the danger of United States direct military intervention and aggressive acts against these countries has intensified.In spite of the efforts of the Contadora and Lima Support Groups and their proposals for the settlement of Latin American problems  there has been no progress. However  these efforts have had a positive impact elsewhere. The fact that members of the Contadora and Lima Support Groups have been able to organize themselves and adopt a common stand on the most sensitive issues of their region  despite their existing political and ideological differences  is a promising movement towards true independence for Latin America as a whole. I hope such common measures will gradually lead to a comprehensive organization of Latin American countries.Unfortunately  owing to certain complexities in the Asian continent  there still seems to be no possibility for the creation of a comprehensive organization representing all countries of the continent. But if existing regional organizations are strengthened  we may one day be able to create a unique organization by integrating them.We also hope that the crises in Asia will end in desirable and just solutions  so that the foundation is laid for relaxing tension and expanding co-operation and unity among the countries in this continent.On the question of Cambodia  we believe that the presence of foreign troops in that South-East Asian country undermines its peace and stability. At the same time  however  we share the concerns of the people of Cambodia about the inhuman and barbarous acts of the previous regime  especially when viewed in their true historical context.On the Korean problem  we still believe that the two Koreas should try to work out a formula for their reconciliation and eventual unity  so that peace  security and stability may be enhanced in that region.Through the expansion of the existing bases and the creation of new ones  the military presence of super-Powers in the Indian Ocean increases the probability of the recrudescence of tensions and clashes among super-Powers. Fifteen years after the adoption of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI)  declaring the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  certain countries still insist on the preservation and expansion of their bases and on their continued military presence. That has frustrated the efforts of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean. We support the convening of the Conference on the Indian Ocean at the earliest possible time. To that end  we hope that the Indian Ocean littoral States  especially the South-East Asian ones  will overcome their minor differences of opinion and work for the establishment of peace in the Indian Ocean through co-operation and co-ordination.On the other hand  the Persian Gulf  as the natural arm of the Indian Ocean  is also exposed to the permanent rivalries of the two super-Powers. Tension in the Persian Gulf has been constantly escalating because of  on the one hand  the Iraqi aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran and  on the other  the intensification of the United States military presence in the countries of the region; the presence of the United States fleet in the Sea of Oman as part of the destructive and aggressive structure of the ""Rapid Deployment Force"" - which  undera new development  is to be called the ""Central Command""*  and the creation of new military bases in Persian Gulf littoral States. This important and strategic waterway  so vital for the stability of the economy of the world  should become a non-military and non-nuclear region and a zone of peace free of chemical weapons. We are working for long-term security in the Persian Gulf. We hope that by putting an end to Iraqi aggression we shall be able to achieve that objective  in close oo-operation with other countries in our region.During the last year  we have witnessed a tragic recrudescence of tension in the Mediterranean region. Continued military rivalries between the two blocs  the intensification of military presence  expansion of military bases for use by foreign fleets  at a time when countries in the Mediterranean region have been trying to transform that region into a zone of peace*  all that is indicative of the fact that the intention is for aggression to move from pluvial borders to the hinterland of littoral States.Aggression against Libya started with a series of provocative acts and military exercises in the Gulf of Sidra  and culminated in an extensive air raid upon Libya  including the bombardment of cities and residential areas - and thus turned into outright military aggression. In spite of efforts made by the United States illogically to invoke Article 51 of the Charter  the overwhelming majority of countries in the international community deemed the United States aggression to be a flagrant violation of Libyan sovereignty and territorial integrity and expressed their solidarity with Libya in its defense of its independence and sovereignty. Thus  the statement of the seven industrialized countries and the European Economic Community which used allegations of terrorism as a pretext to justify their actions  reflected in fact a position adopted by a small minority of countries  a position contrary to that declared by the rest of the countries of theworld. The decision in question is devoid of any value and credibility. Hence  Libya emerged from this aggression more determined than ever before to continue itsrevolutionary policy against Israel and the United States.In view of the numerous acts of aggression that have taken place during the past year  the present session of the General Assembly should include in its agenda an item on the important principle of the non-use of force and aggression  and should devote some time to investigating its various dimensions  preparation of a convention on the non-use of force and aggression has been pending in the General Assembly since 1974 because of obstacles created by certain Western countries. The adoption of a resolution containing the necessary recommendations to prevent the continuation of aggression should be seriously considered in the General Assembly. The Political Declaration of the Summit Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries officially calls on the General Assembly to take up measures to ensure the adoption of a universal declaration in this regard. A more thorough study by this body of the issue of terrorism is necessary.Resolution 40/61 was adopted with certain modification that were made in order to bring the United States to accept a legal framework. The United States did officially accept that framework. Nevertheless  it resorted to the chimerical pretext of terrorism in order to embark on unprecedented aggression. But we believe that the present session of the General Assembly should look deeply into the question of terrorism  and particularly state terrorism and its causes. The Islamic Republic of Iran considers that the third-world countries are the main victims of terrorism acts  either sponsored by Governments or carried out by individuals or groups. But since those countries do not have access to the international mass media  including the press  the many cases of terrorism there do not receive the attention they deserve. On the other hand  sporadic cases in Western countries are given ample space in international news reports.For many long years the people of Iran have been the victims of Government-sponsored terrorism carried out by the imposed former puppet and dependent regime. In the aftermath of the victory of the Islamic Revolution  the people of Iran have again been the target of terrorists  who have been provided with all facilities by Western countries and the United States. The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns all forms and dimensions of terrorism  including Government-sponsored terrorism  and reserves the right to struggle for the liberation movements. It also calls on all countries  especially the Western ones  not to give any help to terrorist groups and to do their best to strengthen the existing conventions.We believe that in the present international situation the economic crises have a greater link than at any time before to the mad arms race. No substantive solution has been found to economic problems  particularly those pertaining to the third-world countries in regard to debt  falling prices of raw materials and underdevelopment*  yet the arms race has gained momentum. The aim of the arms race is to increase spheres of influence and further polarize international relations and exacerbate groupings. That fact is the root cause of most of the problems of our time. In many fields  the speed of proliferation is so great that talks on disarmament cannot even cover them. International conventions relating to a cessation of the arms race and the production and use of weapons are increasingly being violated. The increased use of chemical weapons is an example. Not only are the expenses for the arms race imposed directly or indirectly upon the third-world countries  but these nations are dragged into internationally fabricated tensions and consequently become the main markets of the merchants of death. This dual plundering of economic resources has in turn exacerbated the trend of the underdevelopment and economic dependence of the third-world countries. Thecontinuation of this vicious circle is extremely detrimental to mankind. I hope that the General Assembly will be able to take serious steps to prevent the continuation of this trend  which could be fatal."
"68",3335,"IRQ",41,1986," It gives me pleasure to convey to you. Sir  my most sincere congratulations on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. We find your election even more gratifying since you represent a country with which my country has enjoyed a long history of friendly relations and common interests. I am convinced that your ability and your long experience will guarantee that this session will be successful and that positive results will be reached. I should also like to express our appreciation for the efforts made by your predecessor  Ambassador de Pinies.This session is being held at a time marked by complex international relations caused by mounting international tension  an escalation in the arms race  particularly the nuclear arms race  increasing interference in the internal affairs of States  the use of aggression and force and the threat of such use  in various forms and ways. Finally  it is also due to the grave deterioration of the international economy  which afflicts us all.One of the most important objectives of this Organization is the preservation of peace - the peace that ensures sovereignty  security and the dignity of all peoples. It is no mere chance  therefore  that the Charter of the United Nations has placed on us the collective responsibility of safeguarding this noble human objective.The responsibility of preserving peace obliges us to make further efforts to alleviate tension between the super-Powers in order to provide the stability necessary for the development of international relations. It is our duty therefore to urge the two super-Powers to come together and work for the establishment ofinternational detente  without which no solid foundation for international peace and security can be established. There is no doubt that disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  continues to be an important factor in achieving the stability that must be achieved in international relations because of the great material and human potential that it will release to the development process. We should not forget  in this regard  to refer with appreciation to the positive initiatives of the Soviet Union in the field of disarmament. We hope the United States will meet those initiatives with a positive response.Our collective responsibility in the achievement of peace dictates that we should also resolve the problems confronting some regions by peaceful means and through negotiations based on the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. That is why we call for a peaceful solution to the problems of Cyprus  Afghanistan  Kampuchea and Central America on the basis of respect for sovereignty  non-interference in internal affairs and the territorial integrity of all States concerned. This will enable the peoples of those States to strengthen their unity and face up to the challenges of reconstruction and development.We must also live up to our responsibilities in confronting all forms of foreign domination and in liberating the peoples of southern Africa from the yoke of the oppressive policies of apartheid and racial discrimination imposed by the Pretoria regime  which persists in flagrantly violating the human principles of equality among all men by its continued occupation of Namibia and its perpetration of acts of aggression against the front-line States.In accordance with the principles laid down in the United Nations Charter  Iraq strongly supports the Namibian people in their struggle for independence under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  their sole legitimate representative  and stands by the black people of South Africa in their legitimate struggle for equality  liberty and dignity. We also support the imposition of sanctions upon the apartheid regime  which would be consonant with the principles of the Charter.Our region  and my country in particular  being continually subjected to aggression  are among the areas in the world most greatly in need of peace  stability and the implementation of the principles upon which this Organization was founded.The Palestine people  homeless now for decades  is being subjected in exile to repeated military raids and acts of genocide which aim to erase its national identity. The Palestinians are being subjected to all kinds of pressures and maneuvers in an attempt to distort the facts and impose solutions of submission and surrender upon it and upon the Arab nation.Zionism and Israel have been perpetrating these violations and inhuman practices in complete disregard of humanitarian principles and of the United Nations Charter and its resolutions. Practices such as these have reduced the Arab region to a state of continuing crisis  and the region is thus in urgent need of peace  security and stability. Zionist terrorism and Israeli violations have not been limited to the Palestinians of the diaspora  but have also affected those living under Israeli occupation and facing the Zionist policies of violation of human rights  racial discrimination  deportation  displacement  confiscation of property  the establishment of Zionist settlements on Arab lands and all kinds of measures which aim to distort and erase the identity and cultural heritage of the Palestinian people.Peace and stability in the Middle East cannot be achieved without the Palestinian people exercising its inalienable national right to return to its homeland  determine its own destiny and establish its own State in accordance with its own independent will. Iraq supports most vigorously the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in its just struggle for the achievement of the legitimate aspirations of the Arab people of Palestine.Thus the Israeli and Zionist acts of aggression against the Arab nation have become an obvious reality  but Israel no longer stands alone in perpetrating such acts in the area  for over the past seven years it has had an ally that shares with it the same objectives and methods of terrorism  aggression and distortion of facts  which aim to dominate the Arab region  destroy its unity and tear it apart into sectarian and racist mini-States at war with one another  depriving it of its historic opportunity for reconstruction and progress.This similarity is clearly demonstrated by what is happening today in Lebanon  where the Tel Aviv and Tehran regimes are spreading disorder  anarchy  killing and destruction. It is oily in such a political climate that these two anomalous regimes and their agents can spread their influence in this misery-stricken country. We therefore stand firmly by the Lebanese people in its struggle for peace  stability and national unity  its struggle to end the Zionist occupation of its territory and to outside interference in its internal affairs.At the other end of the region  the Iranian regime is pursuing the same objectives as those of the Zionist regime  by similar methods. Iran is trying to impose its racist hegemony through distortion of facts  aggression  expansion  and war. It was with this aim that the Iranian rulers launched their wide-scale aggression against Iraq on 4 September 1980  and have continued it ever since.The Iranian armed aggression against Iraq has entered its seventh year and although the facts of this aggression have been placed  on more than one occasion  before this Organization  I find it necessary to remind the Assembly of them not for the sake of repetition  but because what is happening today is in actual fact a repetition in itself of the events that took place around this time in 1980. Indeed  what is happening now explains what happened then.During 1979  the year in which the present regime took over power in Iran  Iraq's interests were  as they have always been  very much linked to the preservation of security and stability in the area and to the maintenance of the most amicable relations possible with its neighbors and with the world at large. Iraq had no interest whatsoever in stirring up troubles with its neighbors or with any other country.The Khomeini regime  on the other hand  adopted a policy which it has enshrined in its new constitution  by which it assigned itself sectarian religious jurisdiction over the affairs of all Muslims. The regime began exporting this policy by military force and found in Iraq its first target.The policy of exporting revolution  which represents the cornerstone of the Iranian regime  is a fact that the Iranian Government does not deny. Indeed  the Iranian rulers see in their policy their prime objective to which they have geared all Iran's potential and resources  and in pursuit of which they have employed agents not only in the Islamic world but in the world at large. In pursuing this course  Iran has adopted the ill-famed opportunistic doctrine: ""The end justifies the means"".Proceeding from this aggressive policy  which is alien to the spirit of an age that had long ago rid itself of Nazism and fascism  the Iranian regime began a persistent campaign of aggression against Iraq throughout 1979 and the first nine months of 1980  a campaign that led to the outbreak of war between two neighboringcoin tries that had succeeded for years in establishing good neighborly relations between them.The Khomeini regime assigned to itself the overthrow of Iraq's socio-political system as a basic task which it considered to be a divine duty and an unquestionable right. The Iranian regime attempted to spread acts of terrorism and subversion inside Iraq by employing Iranian nationals to carry out such acts and by inciting civil disobedience in I rag with a view to paralyzing the Government and its apparatus. The rulers of Iran openly called for the assassination of high government officials in Iraq and actually sent out Iranian agents to carry out that task. The Iranian regime invited the puppet Barzani clique back into Iran and began providing it with the assistance and the means to carry out subversive operations against Iraq. Since that contravened the 1975 Agreement requiring Iran to refrain from supporting the said clique  it amounted to a brazen declaration that Iran was no longer prepared to abide by the said Agreement. These acts and measures were accompanied by innumerable  almost daily  Iranian public statements threatening aggression against Iraq  and against its sovereignty and security  and promising the overthrow of its legitimate Government.Furthermore  Iranian officials vied  with each other in the pursuit of this course  as they still do today. It has always been the case that the noisier and more blatantly belligerent an Iranian official is in supporting the Iranian regime's policy of aggression the better chance he stands of securing the approval and support of Khomeini.Along with this  there was during 1979 and 1980 a series of military violations of the Iraqi border. Over the period from February 1979 to September 1980  Iranian military aircraft committed 249 violations of Iraqi airspace. Acts such as cross-border firing and attacks against Iraqi border posts  artillery shelling  obstruction of navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab River  Iraq's vital artery  and bombardment of civilian centers  totaled 244 over the period from June 1979 to September 1980. Iraqi civilian aircraft were fired on three times during the period from August 1980 to September 1980. Iraqi economic plants and oil installations were shelled seven times over the period from January to September 1980.Throughout the time when these deliberate acts were being committed  Iraq tried to communicate with the Iranian rulers through diplomatic channels and warn them against continuing the course of aggression that they had adopted in the hope that they might listen to reason and comply with the principles of international law  so much so that the official notes sent by the Iraqi Government about Iranian violations numbered 293  all of which were of no avail.On 4 September 1980 the situation witnessed a grave development when the Iranian armed forces used heavy 175 millimeter artillery in shelling the Iraqi towns of Khanaqin  Mendili  Zurbatiya and Naft-Khaneh. The shelling was done from Iraqi territories which were to have been returned to Iraq in accordance with the 1975 Agreement. Having refused to hand back those territories  the Iranian regime began massing troops cm them instead  thus willfully threatening the sovereignty andsecurity of Iraq an two counts? first - by the willful military occupation of its territories; and secondly  by willfully shelling Iraqi towns with heavy artillery from those same occupied Iraqi territories.Notwithstanding the fact that on 7 September 1980  Iraq drew I ran !s attention to this conduct which was contrary to Iran's international obligations and asked the Iranian Government to desist from its military encroachments upon Iraqi territory  Iranian shelling continued unabated. Iraq was then left with no other alternative but to exercise its right to legitimate self-defense under the Charter and international law and remove the Iranian occupiers. Thus Iraq was careful to communicate with the Iranian Government on 8 and 11 September 1980  trying on each of these occasions to draw the Iranian Governments attention to the necessity of adhering to its international obligation  including the Agreement of 1975.In the light of such clear evidence about Iran's attitude  and having waited for six whole days following the delivery of its note of 11 September 1980  the Iraqi Government was left with no doubt about the Iranian Government's deliberate violation of the 1975 Agreement and of the elements of the comprehensive settlement embodied therein. Iran had unilaterally abrogated that Agreement in order to extricate itself from its obligations  relating to the demarcation of the border and non-interference in Iraq's internal affairs  and so that it could continue its military operations against Iraqi towns and installations  with a view to achieving Khomeini's overriding objective of overthrowing the legitimate Government in Iraq and turning our country into an Iranian province. Hence  Iraq  having seen Iran abrogate the 1975 Agreement by word and deed  was left with no other choice but to consider that agreement as null and void in accordance with its fourth paragraph and with article 4 of the Treaty on International Frontiers and Good-neighborliness  which was based cm it.Iraq's diplomatic and legal initiative of 11 September 1980 fell on deaf ears in Iran. In fact Iranian leaders called it a conspiracy organized by the Shah. Their response was further Iranian use of military force and even graver threats to the safety and security of Iraq.The Iranian Government continued to escalate the military conflict and  with effect from 19 September 1980  began intensifying its heavy artillery shelling and air bombardment of residential areas and vital economic installations in Iraq  as well as Iraqi and foreign commercial vessels entering and leaving the Shatt-el-Arab River  its navigable channels and its inlets into the Arab Gulf. The Iranian authorities announced Iran's airspace closed to civil aviation and the Straits of Horrauz closed to Iraqi shipping  and at the same time it declared general mobilization  massed large military forces on the borders end began a large-scale military action in which its regular armed forces were used openly. Beginning on 18 September 1980  the Iranian armed forces issued four military communiques on their activities. In the third communique  issued on 19 September 1980  the Iranian authorities boasted about setting ablaze the Na ft-Khan eh oilfields  one of Iraq's important oil-producing areas. In the fourth communique in 1980 the Iranian authorities boasted about demolishing more than 14 tanks  apart from setting an oilfield ablaze.Iran's acts and attitudes prior to 22 September 1980 constituted as a whole a flagrant violation of the principles and provisions of the international law governing friendly relations among nations as laid down in the General Assembly's Declaration on friendly relations adopted by consensus in resolution 2526 (XXV)  on 24 October 1970. Among the salient principles embodied in that declaration are the principles and provisions of good-neighborliness  of non-interference in internal affairs  of sovereign equality of States  and the duty of implementing in good faith international obligations.Further acre  the end result of the series of Iranian aggressive acts and measures  manifested in the first place in Iran's initiation of the use of military force against Iraq with effect from 4 September 1980  comes under the concept of armed aggression  direct or indirect  as defined in General Assembly resolution 3 J14 (XXIX)  adopted by consensus on 14 December 1374.The measures taken by the Government of Iraq since 4 September 1980 to face up to Iran's continued aggression have been in conformity with the right of self-defense in view of the fulfillment of the two conditions of necessity and reasonableness set by international law for the legitimate exercise of such rights.The essential difference between the positions adopted by the two parties has been clear since 1979. It was as clear during the period prior to the outbreak of the war as it has been throughout these six years of fighting. One party  Iraq  believes in international law and good-neighborly relations  rejecting the policy of tutelage over others and seeking to safeguard its sovereignty  security and right to determine its own way in life. The other party  on the other hand  believes in an ideology alien to the laws of the age  a fanatic  aggressive  expansionist ideology the imposition of which on others  by any means available  is considered to be a divine duty.Iran is the party that  in the pursuit of its objectives  has used all possible methods  including armed force  murder  lies and fabrication. Those methods  while condemned by mankind  seem quite legitimate to the Iranian regime as long as they help it attain its desired objectives. What happened during 1979 and 1980 has been repeated over the six years of the war. Indeed  it is being repeated today. The Iranian regime is now beating the drums of war and perpetrating armed aggression against Iraq  reiterating the same old slogans of 1979 and 1980. After six years of war  that regime has neither changed its course nor given up its ambitions. Its business is to wage war  and its aim is to expand.Iranian representatives to this Organization and to other forums try  through deception and fabrication  to distort the facts. They claim that Iraq invaded their country to overthrow the regime in Tehran. That was what they said recently in Harare before the representatives of 101 non-aligned States. We challenge them as we did in Harare  to produce any evidence to this effect. There is an endless catalog of evidence beginning in February 1979 and continuing to this day which shows that the Iranian regime has always had the overthrow of Iraq's political system at the center of its objectives. -here is a mass of evidence  too  of Iranian attempts to destabilize other Governments in the region. But we challenge the Iranian regime to produce evidence substantiating its claims against Iraq.Confident of our position and of the justice of our cause  confident too that we have always been faithful to the principles and values cherished by this Organization and the international community  we have over the years challenged the Iranian regime to accept United Nations arbitration  or that of any other international organization or forum  on the two questions relating to the initiation of the aggression and the continuance of the war  so that no doubt may linger in this respect. The General Assembly is well aware that the Iranian regime has always rejected  and does today  that proposal  which is in conformity with the principles of the Charter  international law and the practice of states  simply because it cannot prove its allegations or substantiate its lies. All it can afford to do is to live under the shadow of war  immersed in a blood-bath and amidst the corpses of its dead.The representatives of the Iranian regime claim in this and other international forums that the war was imposed upon them. We ask this: which party is it that regards the war as a divine mission? Is it Iraq or Iran? How can a war be imposed upon a State when the State itself considers it a godsend and insists upon its continuance as a divine duty and a perpetual mission? What the rulers of Iran used to state six years ago and repeat hysterically today is in itself sufficient evidence as to the party that started the aggression and initiated the war.This fundamental difference between the positions of the two parties has been clearly demonstrated throughout the six years of the armed conflict. From the outset  Iraq has expressed its readiness to settle the dispute by peaceful means  according to the rules of international law and on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of each people and its right to determine its own political and social system. Iraq has always accepted United Nations jurisdiction over the dispute. For its part  the Iranian regime has rejected all this and insisted on continuing the war while declaring its intention to overthrow the Government in Iracr and impose its tutelage over the people of Iraq and the other peoples of the region.During the last session of this Assembly I explained in detail how the Iranian regime had rejected peace immediately after starting its war against Iraq and set absurd pre-conditions for ending its aggression  pre-conditions that are in sharp contravention of the rules of international law and the principles regulating relations among States; pre-conditions  indeed  that reflect accurately the nature of the Iranian regime  which is both anomalous and alien to our world  and the aggressive  expansionist  evil dilections of that regime.I also referred to the international efforts made to resolve certain questions arising from the dispute so as to lessen its complexity  in the hope that step by step a comprehensive peace could be achieved. I explained how the Iranian regime had responded to those efforts in an opportunistic way as long as they served its plans to prolong the war and achieve its morbid dreams of dominating Iraq and the countries of the region. I pointed out to the General Assembly that the common denominator in Iran's methods of tackling the various aspects of the dispute was the adoption of a selective approach to the Charter and international law  taking only such elements of the law as suited its self-interest and served its plans for continuing the war  while rejecting the elements that called for peace  justice respect for sovereignty  good-neighborliness  non-interference in internal affairs  and renunciation of the concepts of hegemony and tutelage and the methods of violence  terror and aggression.It was Iran's strange conduct that led us to respond with great caution to the efforts to find partial solutions to the problems arising from the dispute. I announced here in the General AssemblyP and repeat today  that it was on the basis of that stance on our part  a stance steaming from experience corroborated by fact  that we conducted our discussions with the Secretary-General in 1985 both in Mew York  following his eight-point proposal to the two parties  and during his visit to Baghdad.What happened  however  as the Assembly is well aware  was that the courtesy and appeasement with which the Iranian regime was treated impeded the sound implementation of the principles of the United Nations Chatter and international law  for it lifted the political pressure already exercised on this aberrant regime and hence encouraged it  in effect  to continue its aggression. Allow me to stress once more that to be courteous co aggressive and expansionist regimes neither helps in the establishment of peace  nor contributes to the strengthening of security and stability; for such regimes usually see in any international appeasement or courtesy extended to them a willingness to overlook their crimes and violations of the rules governing relations among States. Appeasement and courtesy  therefore  encourage such regimes to persist in aggression and subversion  which is what has actually happened with Iran.On the night of 9-10 February 1986  the Iranian regime launched a big military offensive which resulted in its forces occupying the Iraqi port of Faw. Iran began speaking of ""the liberation of Iraq"" and issuing threats against the Arab Gulf States advising them to deal with the invasion forces as their new neighbor. The Security Council  as the Assembly is aware  spent many days discussing this development. During the discussion Iraq declared that it was not prepared to accept any course that was not in line with the provisions of the United Nations Charter  international law and inter-State practice in the settlement of international disputes. Iraq also called for an end to be put  once and for all  to the selective and partial approaches to the question  to vague statements  and to the efforts that fail to emphasize the pivotal issue of ending the war in accordance with international rules  we also made it clear that erroneous diplomatic judgements have cost us rivers of blood and untold devastation  and encouraged the Iranian regime to persist in its war with an arrogance unprecedented in the history of the United Nations.The result of the Security Council deliberations was the unanimous adoption on 24 February of resolution 582 {1986) which contained a comprehensive framework for the settlement of the dispute. Despite the fact that the Council adopted this resolutions without being influenced by the attitudes of the two parties  the Iranian regime refused to abide by it. Iranian officials declared time and again that they would carry on with their war against Iraq in execution of a ""divine duty"" by which they were entrusted with ""the liberation of the Iraqi people."" They also announced that they were soaking preparations for a new invasion of Iraq in further discharge of that duty; and new offensives were actually launched against the northern and southern parts of Iraq on the nights of 31 August-1 September and 10-11 September. Then the Iranian rulers pointed out that these offensives were only a prelude to what they described as ""the decisive offensive."" In spite of all this the United Nations and its competent organs are still reluctant to exercise their authority seriously and to discharge the responsibility entrusted to them in the Charter. Resolution 582 (1986) still awaits earnest attention and practical implementation.An essential difference between the two parties is also seen in their respective positions on the issue of security and stability in the region. All States in the region have expressed concern over Iran's policy of destabilization and disturbance. The Organization may recall the complaint filed by the States of the Gulf Co-operation Council in 1984 against the Iranian regime following Iranian acts of aggression against commercial vessels trading with these countries. The Security Council then adopted resolution 522 (1982) which was subsequently rejected by Iran in the same way as it had rejected the Council's resolutions on the Iran-Iraq dispute. Iran continued its acts of aggression and piracy againstshipping in the Gulf. I should like to refer in this connection to the statements issued by the Gulf Co-operation Council during their meetings of 1-2 March 1986 and 26-27 August 1986.The Iranian and Zionist regimes have become the two main sources of threat to the security and stability of the region. They are the only regimes in the region which flout the resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly. They are the only regimes which use force in pursuit of their territorial ambitions and in imposing their tutelage on the peoples of the region. They are unrivaled in the art of lying  misrepresentation and the distortion of facts. While adopting similar ideologies  they both use methods that are obsolete and contrary to the spirit of the age in justifying their policies and deluding their followers. No wonder  therefore  that not only have they found strong allies in each other  but they are also conducting a common fight against Iraq  in Lebanon and in other areas. The Zionist regime exploited the circumstances of the war waged by Iran against Iraq and in June 1981 attacked the Iraqi nuclear reactor intended for peaceful uses. Arms co-operation between the two regimes is as extensive as the stories about it have become commonplace in the world press. Like all hypocrites and impostors  the representatives of these two regimes come to this forum to exchange abuse in order to deceive the international community. However  the light of truth cannot be hidden behind a web of lies and misrepresentation of the kind employed by the rulers of Tel Aviv and Tehran.The political struggle of the peoples of the region should be geared towards putting an end to the Zionist and Iranian aggression  and towards confronting the common campaign of racism and expansion conducted by the forces of Zionism and Khomeinism  so that these peoples may live in security  peace and freedom.Our people has demonstrated throughout six years of fighting its undoubted capability to crush the aggressors  protect its independence and sovereignty and to abort the expansionist dreams of the Iranian regime. Despite the sacrifices made by our valiant people in its pursuit of peace and in defense of its freedom and dignity against the Iranian aggression  our people has never hesitated to extend its hand to peace time and again. Our most recent call for peace came in the open letter addressed by President Saddam Hussein to the rulers of Iran on 2 August 1986  in which he invited them to an honorable peace based on the following principles: first  a total  comprehensive and unconditional withdrawal to the internationally recognized boundaries; secondly  a total and comprehensive exchange of prisoners of war; thirdly  the signing of a peace and non-aggression treaty between the two countries; fourthly  non-interference in each other's internal affairs and mutual respect for each country's choices; fifthly  both Iraq and Iran must be positive elements in all that might contribute to the establishment of stability and security in the region as a whole  and in the Arab Gulf in particular.Although these principles should have been sufficient to safeguard the legitimate rights of both parties  the Iranian regime rejected them  and resorted to raising doubts about the possibility of a renewed escalation of the war in an attempt to justify its anomalous attitude. In order to remove all doubt  we announced our willingness to accept a guarantee from the five permanent members of the Security Council concerning mutual non-aggression between the two parties. We also expressed our readiness to have the agreement on such a guarantee properly documented at the United Nations  and further stated that if this proposal was not to meet with Iranian acceptance  then we would propose an alternative: that the guarantee for mutual non-aggression should come from 60 countries  30 of whichwould be selected by Iran and 30 by Iraq. We also proposed another alternative according to which the guarantee for mutual non-aggression could come from member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. This was in addition to Iraq's readiness to be party to a treaty of non-aggression and good-neighborliness involving all States on the Arab Gulf besides Iraq and Iran.Such a treaty should state in clear and basic terms that  if any signatory State perpetrated aggression against a fellow State- then all States parties to the Treaty should use military force to put an end to the aggression.Iran also rejected these proposals  a fact which exposed yet age in the Iranian regime's false claims about the guarantees. Iran's rejection confirmed once again that the sole objective of its regime was to wage war  nothing but war.Those have been our attitudes and those of Iran. Our demands are clear and simple: we want an honorable peace that safeguards the rights and interests of both parties on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law and practice. That has always been our policy with regard to Iran from the very beginning  and it will continue to be our policy regardless of the sacrifices that our people has to make in defending its dignity and honor and in safeguarding the sovereignty  territorial integrity and cultural heritage of our country.The United Nations cannot  and should not  remain neutral vis-^-vis two such sharply contrasting stands: one totally committed to the Organization  its Charter and its principles; the other scorning it  rejecting its resolutions  and using it merely as a forum for promoting its lies and as a means for continuing the war and threatening the security and stability of the region. It is incumbent upon the United Nations  on the basis of its Charter and in accordance with the responsibilities entrusted to it  to abandon its old negative stand in favor of a new one  a serious and responsible stand that would warn the oarty insisting on war against such insistence  and would show that the Organization was prepared to punish the perpetrator and exert all kinds of pressure upon it to make it desist from the aggression and accept peace.The United Nations and its various bodies should also endeavor to establish peace on the basis of the resolutions of the Security Council  the organ entrustedwith the task of preserving peace. It would be a grave violation of the Charter if the Council's resolutions were in any way ignored in favor of partial diplomatic proposals and appeals  or useless statements of the kind that we have heard throughout the six years of the conflict.We look forward to seeing the United Nations shoulder its responsibility for the maintenance of peace through the position it takes on what has now become the longest war of the century. It is only by living up to its responsibilities that this Organization can justify its existence and deserve the confidence of the peoples of the world."
"69",3382,"ISL",41,1986,"﻿I should like to begin by congratulating Mr. Choudhury cm his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. I assure him of the Icelandic delegation's support in carrying out the duties of that noble office.This November will mark the fortieth anniversary of Iceland's entry into the United Nations. Over this period of time the number of Members has more than tripled  the scope of the Organization's work has expanded even further and  although the Organization has not been entirely effective in all the work it hasundertaken  its value is beyond any doubt. We have here a venue for discussion  andthe exchange of ideas  where the rules and standards of international relations are gradually being shaped.Four decades are a short period in history. We can hardly expect a perfect body of international rules to emerge in such a limited time. Constitutional ideals  such as the rule of law  took many centuries to evolve. The process of granting them appropriate status has never been without struggle or wholly successful.In comparison  it might be said that the institution of international law is still in its infancy. The constitutional history of individual States provides experience that we can use  to a certain extent  as a guide in the future development of international relations.An episode in one of the classics of ancient Greek literature  Homer's Iliad  shed light on the significance of fixed rules governing the relationship between rulers and their subjects. Sarpedon  the son of Zeus and a mortal woman  was fighting Patrocles  the friend of Achilles. Watching their battle  Zeus was filled with sorrow at the thought that his son would fall and was tempted to intervene. ""I wonder now "" he said to his sister  Hera  ""shall I snatch him up and Set him down alive...or shall I let him fall?"" Hera replied that such an intervention would only arouse the anger of the other gods  with unforeseeable consequences  since ""a number of combatants at Troy are the sons of gods.""Zeus heeded Hera's advice  and what he feared happened. But he sent down a shower of bloody raindrops to the earth  as a tribute to his beloved son. The custom dictating the relations of men and gods was so strong that it restricted the actions of even the most powerful of gods. Justice demanded that fixed rules of conduct be obeyed by gods and men alike. The gods were indeed mighty  but their obligations imposed limitations on their power.It is not my intention to draw a parallel between the world Powers and the ancient Greek gods. A comparison of that kind would not be fair. I have taken the liberty of alluding to this episode in support of my view that nations have to respect certain codes and customs and avoid anger and passionate reactions which  if carried to extremes  could lead to the end of civilization as we know it.I also wish too illustrate my belief that the leaders of States must exercise restraint and let their actions be governed more by prudence than by emotion. Minor interests must give way to the prime interest of all mankind  which is to ensure world peace and security.Patience and  at times  a willingness to back down from absolute demands are required. Nations must treat each other with tolerance and show respect for different customs and views. Above all  every Government must take 'care not to stain its actions with anger or ill feeling. If that were to happen  the consequences would be unforeseeable.Nowhere is the need for statesmanlike prudence more urgent than in East-West relations. Last year's summit meeting between President Ronald Reagan of the United States and Mikhail S. Gorbachev  General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party  kindled new hopes for accelerated detente. The leaders of the two most powerful nations on earth had not met for six years. Such meetings are desirable every year  in the hope that if held their effectiveness would increase accordingly.Other promising signs for progress in the field of detente and disarmament have been seen over the past year. The military build-up of the super-Powers long ago reached a stage which makes it difficult to believe that any further build-up could in itself offer them or others greater security. On the contrary  the only way to increase security seems to be by means of negotiated disarmament. Care must be taken that each and every stage reduces uncertainty. Cuts in nuclear arms arsenals would be of no avail if an uncontrolled escalation of conventional weapons were to take place at the same time. Full supervision of the enforcement of disarmament is essential for such steps to be effective.The conclusions readied at the Stockholm Conference on confidence-building measures arouse optimism about the outcome of the third follow-up meeting at Vienna of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). An agreement has been reached in Stockholm expanding earlier commitments obliging nations to announce their military exercises and to allow observers to attend them. Discussions between the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact countries at the talks on mutual and balanced force reduction in Central Europe  held at Vienna  will  it is hoped  bring some tangible results. There have been reports of a possible thaw in attitudes at the intermediate-range nuclear force talks at Geneva. We also hope that an agreement of some sort on chemical weapons will be reached in the disarmament talks under the auspices of the United Nations.Less progress has been achieved in other spheres where attempts have been made to inspire East-West relations. The Berne human eights meeting on freedom of movement and the reunification of families ended this spring regrettably without any results. The same thing happened at the Ottawa expert meeting last year. A large gulf divides East and West on such issues  a gulf which will never be bridged unless countries cease violating the terms of the Helsinki Agreement and demonstrate greater respect for human rights.Despite the positive developments which I have cited  many aspects remain to be considered. As a representative of an island nation in the mid-Atlantic I cannot help expressing ny concern over the enormous build-up in Soviet maritime forces and the continued military build-up on the Kola peninsula. It is crucial for the security of States in that area that this situation be changed for the better.Little would have been achieved if the progress made in certain areas of disarmament were simply to mean another arms race at sea or  for that matter  in space. On this issue it is above all the super-Powers that need to show restraint  not by sacrificing their sons  as Zeus did in the myth that I mentioned  but precisely to prevent a situation which would cost the lives of their sons.Elsewhere the picture is also gloomy. war still rages in Afghanistan and foreign troops continue to occupy Kampuchea. The Middle East is burning with conflicts and there is no end in sight to the civil war in Lebanon and in the war between Iran and Iraq. Streams of refugees are fleeing from these troubled regions and  as the age we live in steadily increases contact between nations  there is a growing danger that local conflicts will escalate  with terrible consequences. Such a risk row hangs over South Africa  where the Government severely violates all civilized rules in its dealings with the black population of that country.Apartheid is a repulsive system which all civilized nations should feel motivated to oppose  but it cannot be denied either that widespread violations ofhuman rights take place elsewhere. What makes the system of apartheid particularly repulsive is that it is decreed by constitutional law  that the South African constitution assumes different laws to apply with regard to white and black people and  furthermore  that it assumes that one race should enjoy freedom at the expense of the other.I should like to mention also a form of crime which the nations of the world must unite against. I am referring to international terrorism  when groups of extremists resort to criminal activities in an attempt to force people into accepting their causes. Innocent people are most often the victims of such action. The world community must adopt stricter measures in order to stop this scourge.A serious world situation exists in more areas than in these tragic instances of military conflict and violence that I have mentioned. Malnutrition and famine  disease and the lack of education afflict a large part of the world's population. Last spring  an extraordinary session of the United Nations General Assembly dealt with the serious economic situation in Africa. Certain measures were agreed there which it is hoped will reduce the amount of suffering on that continent.Besides direct contributions to less fortunate nations  the wealthier nations ought to take various other steps to stimulate world economic development. I should like to underline the necessity of removing trade barriers  protective tariffs and other forms of official interference  which restrict access by the developing countries to the markets of the industrialized world. At the same time domestic growth needs to be stimulated in the developing countries and they must be supported towards self-reliance by various other means.The United Nations has an important role to play in all the fields I have mentioned  but in order for it to serve those aims it needs the support of its Members. It is simply not acceptable for nations to avoid honoring theirobligations towards the United Nations  it is intolerable for the Organization to find itself facing financial difficulties for this and other reasons.Other improvements also are important. The United Nations role in peace-keeping work and disarmament must be strengthened. Iceland  together with the other Nordic nations  has taken initiatives which would result in progress in this field.The United Nations must be able to perform its role more vigorously in these and other areas. The aim is to nurture the seeds which the Organization has sown and thereby help develop mature attitudes in international relations. I began this address with a quotation from classical Greek literature  which I used as an example of great understanding of the principle that the powerful must also obey certain rules if they wish to ensure peace. The United Nations is our instrument for creating such a code in the international arena. The future of mankind demands of our generation that we strengthen this instrument so that it can serve its aims in the most effective way.I would like to conclude by citing the literature of my own nation where an understanding is also to be found of the peace-keeping role of the rule of law. In one' of the most famous of the Icelandic Sagas  the Njals Saga  it is stated that we build society by law but destroy it with lawlessness. These words reflect an understanding of the fact that if a law is broken  peace is broken as well. This applies just as much to the international scene; we build this world with justice but we destroy it with injustice."
"70",3429,"ISR",41,1986,"This session of the Assembly opens the fifth decade of the United Nations. I hope that it will begin an era in which this body will come closer to realizing the dreams of its founding fathers.Their ideals were inspired and inspiring: safeguarding the principles of universality and equality  a genuine desire to maintain international peace and security  encouraging international cooperation in solving global problems and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.Unfortunately  those lofty principles have been vitiated and perverted beyond recognition. Extremists have seized this body. They have compelled it to shun the only peace treaty in the Middle East - the Camp David Accords. They have forced upon it an annual ritual of adopting dozens of distorted and irrelevant resolutions relating to my country. In clinging to these barren exercises  the United Nations spends precious time and funds  resources that could profitably be used to combathunger and poverty.These and other issues remain unresolved  however  and they demand serious and responsible attention. First among them is the repugnant reign of apartheid in South Africa.Israel  founded upon basic moral and democratic values  cannot remain silent in the face of racial discrimination  wherever it nay occur.. We reject and condemn apartheid as a political  social and economic system. Israel also believes that violence is not the path to reform in South Africa. We must urgently foster a climate that will facilitate a political settlement if we are to avoid a further drift towards economic chaos  suffering and bloodshed. We hope responsible leaders on all sides will act to create such a climate and that the Government of South Africa will initiate negotiations that will satisfy the legitimate political aspirations of all South Africans  regardless of race or color.In the heart of the African continent many continue to suffer from hunger  disease and poverty. There is a growing awareness around the world of the need to provide help. People must be fed right now. We have contributed to that effort  but we also believe that we must help countries afflicted by hunger to develop the long-term means to prevent its recurrence and to set their economies on the road to development and growth.This past year the General Assembly convened a special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. The Organization of African unity (OAU) has outlined a development strategy that is reminiscent of Israel's own development experience. Israel announced at that special session its readiness to make immediate contributions to the attainment of those goals. We offered to share our experience in agriculture and desertification  in medicine and education and in the general field of economic development. Many in Africa remember our earlier contributions in this field. Our experience has been gained in 28 years of assistance by Israel to more than 100 countries in Asia  Africa and Latin America. We have trained over 55 000 professionals from developing countries. We have shared our experience with the specialized agencies of the United Nations. And we are ready and willing to do more.Many of those African States that severed relations with Israel in 1973 and 1974 are now in the process of resuming those relations. I wish to commend the leadership and courage of the Heads of State who have gone on to re-establish formal diplomatic ties with us despite the pressures exerted upon them. We extend the hand of friendship and co-operation to all African nations and we expect many more countries to resume full diplomatic relations with Israel in the near future.The Middle East  with its vast resources of land and minerals  has within it the potential to leap into a new age in the twenty-first century - an age of great economic prosperity and a better life for millions. But that hope hangs on the outcome of a precarious contest between those who seek progress and those who continually plunge the region into turmoil and hatred.Perhaps the most tragic instance of the fanaticism that plagues our region is the cruel war waged by Iran and Iraq for the past six years. That war has claimed well over a million casualties; it has reintroduced outlawed means of warfare such as gas and chemical weapons and the wholesale torture of prisoners; it has hurt the entire world by threatening freedom of navigation and the free flow of oil. It is a sad commentary that  despite their various proclamations  those two warring Governments show no intention whatsoever of genuinely seeking ways to stop the horrible carnage.Another instance of the reign of fanaticism and its terrible human cost is Lebanon. The tragedy is rooted in the chronic absence of an effective Government able to control and reconcile the warring factions. Without such a strong central authority  Lebanon has been unable to discharge the most elementary obligations of government - the control of one's territory against lawlessness and terror  terror directed against one's own citizens and against the citizens of neighboring States.The first to pay for that anarchy have been the Lebanese themselves. Over 100 000 were slaughtered in the civil war of 1975-1976 and thousands of others have been killed since in sectarian clashes. Lebanon's Government has set no effective jurisdiction over any part of the country: not over the Bekaa Valley or Tripoli  where 20 000 Syrian troops physically occupy Lebanese territory; not over the Shouf Mountains; not even over Beirut itself. Such conditions encourage the reign of the gun  the rocket and the bomb throughout Lebanon. Naturally  the southern part of the country has not been exempt from that dismal pattern. Beginning with the PLO  various terrorist groups have used the south as a staging area for terrorist attacks against Israel. Those who expected that a ""Pax Syriana"" would pacify Lebanon were hopelessly deluded .for Syrian domination of Lebanon has meant that Syria has been playing off one factor against another  as well as using Lebanon as a base for proxy terror attacks against Israeland against targets world-wide.That Syrian strategy  now shared by Iran  should concern the entire international community. As for Israel  we have one  and only one  objective regarding Lebanon: to protect northern Israel against attacks launched from Lebanon. This is self-defense in its simplest form. We shall not let Israeli citizens pay with their lives for Lebanon's failure to control its territory. We shall continue to take the necessary measures to defend our people. We hope that Lebanon will produce an effective Government with which we can agree on permanent security arrangements. In the meantime we shall continue to work with any Lebanese party genuinely interested in preventing terror in the South of Lebanon and in the North of Israel.The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has tried to assist in bringing stability to the area. It has performed a useful role. It has suffered painful casualties in the process  including losses sustained in a recent rash of murderous attacks. We extend ou£r deepest condolences to the bereaved families end their Governments. We must be clear  however  on what role UNIFIL can and cannot play. International forces are most effective when they serve as buffers between two States that share a commitment to pacifying their common border. Unlike Israel's neighbors on two other borders  that is not the case with Lebanon. That is why UNIFIL  unlike the multinational Force in the Sinai and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights  has been unable to act as an effective buffer  since the day it was established by the United Nations. Peace-keepers cannot be asked to combat terrorists. That role must be left to the Governments and the peoples in the area of turmoil. We shall continue to co-operate with UNIFIL  as we maintain the necessary security arrangements to defend our norther border.Israel watches with concern the larger conflicts waged in our region: those between radicals and non-radicals  between conservative regimes and revolutionaries  among militant religious movements  and among the various dictatorships themselves. But there is little we can do to affect this tragic and chronic violence. Where we can act - where we have acted and shall continue to act - is in the limited confines of the dispute between the Arab States and Israel.Ever since Israel's independence we have made every effort to achieve peace with our neighbors. Peace for us is a natural and integral part of our heritage. The Jewish people is a democratic and free people striving to rebuild its national life in the ancient - the only - homeland of the Jews. Israel is a haven for the persecuted  a land where ever Jew from whatever background feels at home. We can best achieve our ideals and goals in an atmosphere of peace and security. Hence  we cherish peace? we pray for it and we teach its blessings to our children. Our entire people rejoiced when  after decades of war which were forced upon us  we were able to build a bridge of peace with one of our Arab neighbors.During the past year we have made special efforts to broaden that peace. In July  Prime Minister Peres visited Morocco for talks with King Hassan. We have made efforts to reinforce the peace treaty with Egypt and to solve the problems that are still outstanding. We hope we are on the threshold of a substantial improvement in the relations between our two countries. Such an improvement is vital in and of itself  and of even greater importance for the prospects for peacewith other Arab States.A few days ago we marked the eighth anniversary of the signing of the Camp David accords. With the passage of time we can see that those accords were a turning-point in the history of the Middle East. They have proved decisively that there is a way out of the cycle of belligerency  and they have demonstrated unequivocally that there is no alternative to direct negotiations. To this very day they remain the one and only blueprint for accommodation and peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. All attempts to bypass  nullify or denigrate the Camp David accords have failed. Those attempts have been unsuccessful because they have disregarded the minimal needs of all parties  because they were not rooted in achievable proposals acceptable to all the sides.Camp David accords are still the leading parties to which everyone concerned with peace in the Middle East turns. Together they hold the key to progress towards peace. With its commitment to the accords  Egypt has gained in prestige and stature. Many of those in the Arab world who once attacked and boycotted it are now looking to Egypt to play a leading role in peace negotiations. The United States  of course  is equally sought after. Many have come to appreciate the positive influence it brings to bear on the political process in our region.For its part  Israel remains anxious and willing to move the peace process forward without delay. The peace treaty with Egypt was intended to be the first in a series of treaties that together would constitute a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israel conflict.Those who are afraid of peace or who are seeking to evade peace with Israel are trying to promote an alternative to direct negotiations  and ultimately to peace itself  through an international conference. Let me repeat again: Experience proves that the only path to peace is through direct negotiations. Substitutes for such negotiations can only lead us away from peace. The history of our region provides anple evidence of this simple truth.The Government of Israel has repeatedly called upon King Hussein of Jordan to enter into direct peace negotiations with Israel. We recognize that once he decides to respond to our call Jordan may face considerable opposition from some Arab quarters. That opposition  however  will not be deflected or appeased by such devices as an international conference. Ultimately  Jordan will have to decide whether the advantages of peace with Israel outweigh the risks and difficulties involved in making such a move. But Jordan must understand that its peace will have to be with Israel  not with an international body. The first sign of agenuine willingness to move towards peace is a declared readiness to deal directly with one's former adversary. There is no other way to a genuine reconciliation.We firmly believe that the absence of democracy and freedom in our region is a major obstacle to peace. Only democracy offers the guarantee of freedom  the hope of progress and the prospect of peace. We do not believe any people want war. We do not believe the Arab peoples want war. Wars of aggression are initiated by Governments that do not represent the will of their peoples and fail to reflect their aspirations. That is why we must hope that democratic Governments will prevail throughout the Middle East on a not too distant day  for on that day true and permanent peace will come to our region. To hasten the coming of that day we call on all countries interested in peace in the Middle East strongly to support direct talks between Jordan and Israel. We call on them strongly to signify their willingness to buttress and strengthen a peace settlement by declaring their readiness to endorse it immediately. In addition  the supporters of peace should undertake to extend whatever assistance and support may be needed by the Government and the people of Jordan to embark on an ambitious development Program that will accompany the implementation of the peace treaty. The rewards of peace must be swift and exemplary  and serve to belie the words of its opponents.Our region - the entire world in fact - is plagued by the spread of Arab terrorism. There is no limit to its atrocities. Even places of worship are not immune to this wanton murder. The recent attack on a synagogue in Istanbul was merely the latest and deadliest in a series of such attacks on Jewish places of worship. But Jews are not the only victims. Arab terror has made a blood pact with terrorists from all over the world to fight the common enemy  of which Israel and Jews are merely a part. That enemy is the community of democratic nations. The fight against this menace is therefore the fight of all civilized and free nations.The so-called PLO was the linchpin of this alliance in terror; it pioneered the art of hijacking  bombing  kidnapping and massacre on an international scale. In the decade preceding 1982 the PLO used its mini-State in Lebanon to train and arm terrorist groups from five continents  from left-wing extremists to neo-Nazi gangs. Libya  Syria and Iran joined in financing  training and arming the terrorists and providing them with safe havens.Since our action in Lebanon in 1982  the PLO has disintegrated into a number of rival terrorist gangs  most of them mercenaries in the service of various Governments. Their one common objective is to sabotage any attempt at peace and stability. The legacy of terror that they have created has encouraged other terrorist groups  many of them possessed by a mad desire to spread anarchy and terror for no reason whatsoever.Much has been said about ways to combat international terrorism  but little has been done. Terrorism will continue to take its toll as long as the terrorists believe they can kill with impunity and achieve legitimacy and their political goals in the process. They must be denied these victories. They must never be appeased. They must never be ""understood"". They must always be condemned and fought vigorously. If we are serious in our desire to rid ourselves of international terrorism  we must adopt a broad and comprehensive campaign against the terrorists.We must expel the representatives of terrorist organizations  starting with the PLO  from all countries committed to the fight against terror. We should hunt down the terrorist killers. They must always be on the run. But no matter what measures we take against the killers themselves  they will not be enough. If we do not go to the source  to the regimes whose support and protection make terrorism possible  we will not succeed in rolling back the tide of terror. We must isolateand punish those terrorist States. We should shut down their embassies  expel their diplomats  curtail trade with them  and co-ordinate a military response if they persist in attacking us. Those who refuse to address the problem of State-supported terrorism are not merely failing to solve the problem? they arefacilitating its expansion.Last year  from this rostrum  I spoke of three major threats facing the countries of the Middle East: the escalating race in conventional arms  the dangers of nuclear weapons  and the grave problem of chemical warfare. Unfortunately  little if anything has been done to reduce those threats. In fact  in some ways the situation has worsened in the past year.The most dramatic development has been the increased use of chemical weapons by Iraq in its war with Iran. This has been investigated by the united Nations and condemned by the President of the Security Council on behalf of its members. There is also considerable evidence that other States in the Middle East  most notably Syria  are developing a chemical warfare capability. The free world should pool information on this subject and adopt concerted measures to prevent the development or acquisition of chemical and biological weapons. We cannot afford to cower before dictatorships that stockpile these inhuman inventories  especially since these regimes have shown no hesitation in using them.To our disappointment  negotiations on a nuclear-weapon-free zone among the States in the region have yet to begin. It is our firm belief that  in an area as sensitive as the Middle East  the most effective and credible barrier to proliferation would be a freely and directly negotiated convention establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries were among those which supported the establishment of our State in 1948. But things have changed. With the exception of Romania  all the Eastern-bloc countries have severed their diplomatic ties with us and adopted a one-sided policy towards the Middle East. We welcome  of course  any sincere attempt at improving relations and re-establishing diplomatic ties between us and any Eastern European country.This year  for the first time in nearly 20 years  an official meeting took place in Helsinki between representatives of Israel and the Soviet Union. We hope that it is a sign of a positive change in the policy of the Soviet Union towards Israel. Without such a renewal of diplomatic relations and without a major change in the Soviet Union's policy towards Soviet Jews - especially the policy that prevents them from exercising their basic right of repatriation to Israel - it is difficult to see how the Soviet Union could contribute in any way to the attainment of peace in our region.The plight of our Jewish brethren in the Soviet Union has been raised countless times by Israel's representatives and by world leaders; yet the tragic suffering continues. The hope that a new leadership in the Soviet Union would bring with it an improvement in the situation of Soviet Jewry has  so far  not been borne out. The condition of Soviet Jews  especially those among them wishing to leave for Israel  has deteriorated still further.In a country of over 100 nationalities  speaking over 100 languages  Jews remain the only officially recognized nationality in the Soviet Union denied the right to maintain its cultural heritage and pass it on to the next generation. They are forbidden to study their ancient language  Hebrew. Throughout the entire length and breadth of the Soviet Union there is not a single Jewish school where Jews may study their history  literature and traditions.In recent years  hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Soviet Union have expressed their desire to join their people in Israel. But the Soviet authorities have effectively stopped Jewish emigration; less than 500 Jews were allowed to leave during the first eight months of this year. Thousands have had their requests for exit permits repeatedly refused on the flimsiest of pretexts; as punishment for daring to apply to leave  they have been subjected to all manner of harassment and reprisals. Among those ""refuseniks"" are the prisoners-of-Zion  who have been subjected to arrests and lengthy terms of imprisonment on trumped-up charges. The real reason for their imprisonment is painfully clear: it is their insistence on their right to emigrate to Israel and their right to study Hebrew and persevere in their Jewish heritage.The Soviet policy towards Soviet Jews is a flagrant violation of the International Convention on Human Rights  to which the Soviet Union is a signatory. It is totally contrary to the letter and spirit of the Helsinki Accords. The refusal of the Soviet Government to fulfill its most elementary humanitarian obligations must weigh heavily in the considerations of all who would contemplate entering into agreements with the Soviet Union on any subject.Prom this rostrum  I call upon Governments and people of good will everywhere to urge the Soviet Government to bring its behavior towards Soviet Jews into line with universally accepted international standards. We in Israel will not rest until every Jew in the Soviet Union is permitted to exercise his right to emigrate and until Jews are free to follow their ancestral traditions and faith.Another beleaguered Jewish community are the Jews of Syria. They are subjected by the Syrian regime to discrimination and restrictive policies. They are not free to live wherever they wish. Several hundred young Jewish women cannotfind husbands in the Jewish community. The Syrian Government has callously refused to allow then to leave the country so that they may marry within their faith and establish families. Jews who wish to travel abroad must leave their families behind as living hostages to ensure the travelers return. All that  too  is another instance of flagrant violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  to which Syria is a signatory.None of the problems I have described  including those relating to our region  is insoluble. They can be resolved if the Governments involved muster genuine good will  we turn again to the leaders of our Arab neighbors with an outstretched hand of peace. Let us bring an end to belligerency and hatred. Let us make real the hopes for a new era of understanding and coexistence. We shall not spare any effort in this quest  nor will we give up hope that it will bear fruit.The eyes and hearts of millions of human beings who are wasting away from hunger and poverty  who live under oppressive regimes that deny them basic human rights  who are victims of barbaric terror  are turned towards us in the hope that we can alleviate their suffering. They look to us  to this body  for the hope of a better future. We cannot let them down and still claim fidelity to the ideals of this Organization. We bear the responsibility to begin action now for their sakes and for the sake of our place in history. Let us not forsake them  or our aspirations for a better and safer world."
"71",3476,"ITA",41,1986,"I should like first of all. Sir  to convey to you my most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. You represent a continent that plays a primary and increasingly authoritative role on the world scene and a country with an ancient civilization and traditions to which Italy is bound by ties of warm friendship and co-operation. I also wish to extend my warmest thanks and congratulations to your predecessor. Ambassador Jaime de Pinies.Once again from this rostrum I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Perez de Cuellar  with whom we enjoy relations of profound trust and esteem  and reiterate the Italian Government's appreciation of his persevering efforts to promote the principles of the United Nations Charter and strengthen the role and machinery of the Organization.The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom  in his capacity as current President of the European Community  illustrated this morning the views of its 12 member States on the major issues today facing the international community. Those views  which we share  are the expression of policies which are aimed at promoting greater stability and co-operation in international relations.The dramatic and sometimes tragic events we have witnessed in the past few months have made us acutely aware  perhaps as never before  that the world in which we live is one of interdependence. We have seen how the effects of conflict^ tensions can jeopardize global security and gained a better understanding of the interrelationship of the economies of different and even distant areas. We have also had direct proof that man's achievements in science and technology  both positive and negative  know no frontiers.It was for this reason that we decided to make co-operation and dialog the central theme of the celebration of the International Year of Peace which took place in Rome last July. That celebration was  in fact  marked by a meeting devoted to ""dialog as the universal foundation of peace"". I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for agreeing to participate in the meeting and address it.dialog is needed more than ever before in the field of science. If any lesson has been learned from the tragic events of Chernobyl it is that science  in releasing new and unforeseeable powerful energies and resources  has certainly opened up possibilities for progress  but has also liberated forces which could destroy us. We therefore need intensive collaboration among scientists  which will prove possible only if we are able to translate fully into reality the idea of an international scientific community without frontiers.We should  however  harbor no illusion that this scientific community will materialize spontaneously. As Government leaders  we must  rather  work to encourage its realization. We must therefore think of new instruments better suited to present needs. At the scientific meetings which took place in Ericem Sicily  and which Italy not only hosted but fully supported  participants put forward ideas  proposals and concrete programs  such as the program for open laboratories  which are  in our view  a step in the right direction and which are starting to attract the attention of Governments.The establishment in Geneva of the World Laboratory is a concrete example of the extent to which the scientific community can make a concrete contribution to the East-west and the North-South dialog and to the building of peace. Renowned scientists  academicians and Nobel Prize winners  including numerous representatives of the third world as well as prestigious institutions  have signed the constituent act of the Laboratory. Their goal is to promote science without secrets or frontiers  in the just belief that the free circulation of scientific information is a powerful instrument capable of creating a climate of safely and mutual trust in East and West and in North and South.In the most important negotiations on arms limitations  in which the main participants are the United States and the Soviet Union  the parties have put forward at the negotiating table various proposals which  in our view  indicate their common determination to achieve reductions in the most destructive weapons. A new summit meeting between the two major Powers  while responding to the expectations of so many countries  could give an irreversible impetus to this trend.A balance of forces at levels lower than those existing today must be achieved  but essential requirements must be respected: such a balance must be established at the global level  taking into account the interrelationship which exists between the various components of military equilibrium. The Italian Government  for its part  attaches great importance to the prospects which seem to be opening up for negotiations aimed at achieving balanced reductions of conventional forces in Europe.A decisive role in the pursuit of disarmament agreements is also being played by the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. We hope that the work of the Conference will result  inter alia  in the speedy conclusion of a convention for a total and verifiable ban on chemical weapons.In the same spirit we welcome the constructive compromise agreement that was reached at the Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe  held in Stockholm. We hope that this agreement will be the basis for a new and more constructive approach to a problem which is of primary concern to European countries. This agreement augurs well for the future  in our view  because it signals a more general willingness to seek compromise.We hope in particular that the third follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  in Vienna  will result in a qualitative change in East-West relations affecting not on]y dealings between States but the situation of their citizens.Another area in which dialog and international co-operation are necessary  is that of terrorism  which is the very antithesis of dialog  reason and persuasion. Terrorism is a grave threat to peace. Mo political situation  however unjust  can justify any departure for even a moment from the principles of law. Nor can there be any justification for the conduct of those who deliberately disregard their obligation to seek political solutions to their problems  thereby jeopardizing the well-established supremacy of law over force. If we stray from the path of law we have anarchy and the triumph of irrationality.I believe  nevertheless  that there is a growing consensus on the need for a joint  organized response to that phenomenon of such alarming dimensions  beginning with the determination and identification of responsibilities. Solidarity in the fight against terrorism can already be seen at the regional level within the framework of the European Community and that of the summit meeting of the seven industrialized countries in Tokyo  as well as in the broader framework of the United Nations.In this context may I recall the initiative taken by Italy - in association with other friendly countries - in proposing a convention on the safety of shipping and our support for the Canadian initiative on airport security. Moreover  Italy is convinced of the need for stricter compliance with the norms of general international law  including the Vienna conventions on diplomatic and consular relations. For this reason we recently adopted measures for the control of diplomatic pouches. We hope that other countries will follow our example  thus contributing to international co-operation in suppressing the traffic in arms.It is essential also  in my view  to work to remove those causes of tension that offer terrorism alibis which are in some cases far too easy. I am thinking in particular of those areas where crises are most acute  such as the Middle East. Throughout the area there are manifestations of a profound desire for peace  justice and attempts at dialog which are even breaking through the traditional psychological barriers between the Arab world and Israel  and between Israel and the Soviet Union. However  we note with regret that certain preconditions are still being maintained and that there is no prospect of their being reconsidered in the future. This prevents achievement of the two necessary bases for a just and lasting solution of the Middle East conflict: the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to a peaceful and secure existence and the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.A dialog must finally be started on that basis and in pursuance of those objectives  with the indispensable participation of all the parties concerned and the constructive support of those countries which are in a position to play a significant role in the region. Italy  together with its European partners  remains determined to contribute to that dialog  to the best of its ability and with the utmost dedication. We must also work to bring to an end the state of blind and chaotic violence prevailing in Lebanon and to promote a frank and sincere dialog between all the communities of that country. Italy is contributing to the stability and security of at least part of that country through its participation in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We believe that United Nations forces still have an important role to play in that area. That role is  first of all  the one decided by the Security Council in its resolution 425 (1978)  which must be respected and implemented in its entirety. At the same time it would be unjust to ignore the positive effects of the presence of the peace-keeping Force in southern Lebanon  even under present conditions. For this reason we must carefully consider whether withdrawal of the Force would not entail the risk of further jeopardizing chances for a positive evolution of the situation.We would like to see the method of dialog applied to other situations in areas adjacent to the Mediterranean region where distressing and dangerous crises persist and in some cases are escalating. I am thinking in particular of the conflict between Iraq and Iran which continues to cause tragic losses of life and large-scale material damage.Our Organization has repeatedly issued resolute and specific calls for peace  and no effort has been spared to initiate peace negotiations. We all remember the efforts deployed to this end by the late Olof Palme. We believe that the Security Council should make another solemn appeal for a cease-fire and a return to peace. Should such an appeal go unheeded  it would be necessary to use all the means available under the Charter of the United Nations for the restoration of order in a situation in which it was clearly violated.At the special session on Africa held last May  Africa's problems were confronted in a spirit of constructive realism. The African Governments recognize that they themselves bear the primary responsibility for the continent's economic take-off and have undertaken to pursue policies designed to start an autonomous development process with the co-operation of the international community.Italy intends to make a contribution to follow-up action to the special session. In regard to the central problem of external indebtedness and its consequences  I intend to inform the ministers for foreign affairs of sub-Saharan Africa of our intention when the Italian delegation meets with them later this week. Our purpose is to try to move to the stage of concrete operative solutions  which may also serve as an experiment and an example.While the method of dialog is making headway  for example  in the direct talks between Ethiopia and Somalia  unfortunately we find that within South Africa repression and violence are being stepped up and the prospects of peacefully eliminating a system based on racist principles are receding. The international community must continue to exert every effort to promote favorable conditions for the initiation of a dialog between the Government and the political and social forces in the country aimed at building a society based on justice  equality and the full realization of the legitimate civil and political rights of all South Africans.The South African Government cannot continue to ignore the unanimous reprobation of the international community. The Twelve recently decided to send a clear signal to the South African Government by moving from the stage of restrictive measures to that of sanctions in the full sense of the term. At the same time they will continue to assist the black population of South Africa and neighboring countries.The process of restoring and strengthening free and democratic institutions in Latin America certainly offers grounds for hope  in spite of the fact that freedom continues to be denied in a country like Chile where democratic traditions are among the oldest in the region. Political gains are  however  in danger of being nullified by a widespread economic crisis  with all its disruptive effects. We must therefore exercise constant vigilance and concretely commit ourselves to preventing social forces hostile to democracy  and the economic situation  from jeopardizing results that have been achieved at great cost.In Asia  a crisis like the one prevailing in Afghanistan has repercussions which are felt well beyond the regional context. We hope that the proximity talks held under the auspices of the Secretary-General will lead to positive developments. Italy continues to believe that a negotiated solution of that crisis must lead to a genuine and speedy withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and the restoration of the independence and self-determination of that country.A similar solution should be sought for the question of Kampuchea. We are therefore deeply concerned at the absence of even the first signs of a dialog capable of leading to a just and peaceful settlement of that problem.The system of dialog and multilateral co-operation  in which we believe  must go hand in hand with a healthy development of international economic collaboration.Many problems remain to be resolved in this field. Among them  besides the problem of indebtedness - which I have already mentioned - is the need to ensure that international trade enjoys a sustained and balanced growth  which will require the elimination of protectionist practices  the removal of non-tariff barriers  and also a redefinition of national policies to support agriculture. The tasks confronting the United Nations affect not only relations between States but  in the current circumstances  also the well-being and progress of peoples owing to problems such as terrorism and drugs that tend to erode the very fabric of our societies. The problem of drugs  for instance  is an international phenomenon with complex structures and manifestations. It therefore requires an international response. For this reason Italy puts high hopes in the action of the United Nations  particularly the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC)  in this field and is making a substantial contribution to it in terms of efforts andfinancial resources.If the United Nations system is to meet appropriately such a vast range ofresponsibilities and commitments  it must constantly improve the efficiency of itsmachinery. We therefore support the action taken by the Secretary-General and theGeneral Assembly to ensure sound  effective administration of this Organization.in that spirit we welcome the proposals contained in the report of the Group ofHigh-Level intergovernmental Experts. However  our goal must be clearlyunderstood: we want to strengthen the United Nations system  certainly not promotea reduction in its role.Italy is a member of the two great  free political systems of the West  theAtlantic Alliance and the European Community. In our view this strengthens ourcapacity to participate fully in the life and activities of the broadermultilateral system represented by the United Nations. The process of Europeanintegration  which Italy pursues with particular conviction  has the purpose ofincreasing the capability of European countries to contribute to stability ininternational relations and to removing tensions and conflicts  promoting economicand social development and co-operation and  lastly  reaffirming those values offreedom  democracy and respect for human rights that are an integral part ofEuropean civilization.It is in this spirit that Italy is participating in the building of a Europe which we believe is bound in the not too distant figure to become the main partner of all States Members of this Organization that share the same objectives of peaceand progress."
"72",3522,"JAM",41,1986,"Ambassador Choudhury's election to preside over this Assembly is a fitting tribute to his vast experience and tested diplomatic skills. Indeed  it is also a tribute to the capacity of the Organization to live up to its ideals as a democratic concourse of nations. For his country  Bangladesh  like the overwhelming majority of states gathered here  brings to this world body neither the trappings of economic power nor military strength. What he brings is an active and unswerving commitment to peace and development and to the pursuit of those ends through consensus-building and international co-operation. We confidently anticipate a productive session under his guidance.I wish to commend Ambassador Jaime de Pinies of Spain for the skillful and able manner in which he carried out his tasks during the fortieth anniversary session ofthe General Assembly.Each session of the Assembly provides a new opportunity for States to reflect on the course of recent events  to assess their import and to reach new levels of understanding about the problems the world community and its members face. The repetition and ritual which cloak the diplomatic behavior of States and which inevitably accompany participation in this general debate need not obscure the fact that  at the core  this is a profoundly rational and democratic approach to mediating and managing relations among States. In this regard  the United Nations embodies the ancient  often violated but eternally resilient ideals of discussion  compromise and consensus  which are indispensable to the concept of community. This is the Organization's underlying and manifest strength; it is the source of Jamaica's conviction that during its present crisis  and through others that will no doubt follow  the United Nations will not simply persist  but will prevail.This Organization would do well not to succumb to a teleological view of the future. The fact is that  no matter how desirable its goals and lofty its ideals  there is no automatic reason why these will ultimately be met. What is necessary is the conscious  deliberate molding of the Organization to meet new challenges and the rigors of a changing environment. A firm anchor to the time-tested and enduring ideals of the Charter is not inconsistent with a dynamic  adaptive and innovative world body. The United Nations is not the ossified  anachronistic body its detractors purport to be  but there can be no doubt that it must use its accumulated experience more effectively in dealing with old problems. It must move less ponderously. We must now devise ways and means of dealing effectively with a new generation of perplexing international problems. This is the crucial challenge facing the Organization and its Member States.Among these problems is the issue of international terrorism. The primary purpose of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security; and international terrorism has emerged  full-blown  as a potent threat to international peace and to the security of individuals and States. This is a particularly pernicious kind of violence. Its random and indiscriminate nature  its rapid and shadowy spread across borders and  in many cases  the faceless character of its perpetrators create a climate of fear  apprehension and hostility. This is confined not solely to the immediate victims  for it is the nature of terror that its victims must be counted not only among those subject to physical ravages of violence  but among all those burdened with the fear of random attack.My Government condemns international terrorism in the strongest terms. The international community must build upon the advances made at the fortieth session of the General Assembly in addressing this issue. We must also seek now to strengthen the international legal regime laid down earlier through the outlawing of specific acts  such as those covered in the Conventions relating to civil aviation and to the taking of hostages  and other related instruments. We believe that the co-operation of all States  the full exchange of information and ratification of and adherence to the existing international legal instruments are essential elements of a strengthened multilateral approach to this issue. The onited Nations should encourage and facilitate this process by all the means at its disposal. Indeed  it may be timely for consideration to be given to the preparation  within the framework of the Organization  of a convention on the suppression of international terrorism. At the same time  it must be made clear that we do not agree with what appears to be a deliberate attempt to confuse international terrorism with the fight for self-determination by national liberation movements. We recognize that there are still cases of colonial and racist domination where political expression has been stymied. It is  therefore  incumbent on this Organization  and on the members of the Security Council in particular  to work more assiduously to find and implement political solutions which diminish the potential for recourse to violence as an instrument of change.I have spoken of a new generation of international problems. There is irony in this. The increase in communications  including greater ease and facility of travel  has contributed immensely to the evolution of a world community. But at the same time those same forces have had an unintended impact. They have served to intensify and make international  on an unprecedented scale  problems that previously were largely confined within national borders. It has been observed that the psychological effects of terrorist violence tend to be out of proportion to its purely physical impact - horrible as the latter might be. This is instructive  for such universal trauma is possible only where there is a collective psyche emerging and where the randomness and scope of violence threaten to victimize mankind itself.That is also the nature of the illicit international traffic in drugs. That shadowy menace  stalking whole societies  is another example of the new kind of problem facing the international community. The interdependence of the modern world has created conditions in which the illicit traffic  production and consumption of harmful drugs flourish. The evidence now makes clear that this development is a problem of immense proportions. It is a threat not only to health and morals but  if left unchecked  an insidious force capable of undermining the social and political fabric of whole societies. For that reason this is hardly a domestic or bilateral issue  but a problem for the international community to address energetically and with the financial  technical and other resources at its disposal.The countries of the developing world are themselves victims of that traffic. We fear that the preoccupation with dividing the world into sources of supply and markets  into producers and consumers  is an artificial attempt to assign culpability  is too often self-serving  and deliberately obscures the fact that it is the poor countries which are most vulnerable to the deleterious consequences of the illicit international traffic in drugs.Those countries lack the resources to deal with the pernicious consequences of the abuse of drugs in their populations. In addition  the movement of massive funds from the drug trade into those communities has been known to undermine  or seek to undermine  the electoral processes. Hence  it attacks the very foundations of democratic societies.Why do people trade in those destructive drugs? The answer is simple: they do it for profit. We must  therefore  find ways to take the profit out of illicit drugs.My Government is currently examining proposals for legislation which will enable the authorities to trace  freeze  seize and confiscate the proceeds of trafficking in drugs.Jamaica hopes that next year's world conference  in Vienna  on drug abuse and illicit trafficking will lead to an effective and supportive role by the United Nations in dealing with this problem  and will lay the foundation for more effective co-operation among Member States of the international community on this issue.This is the International Year of Peace. It is perhaps  an unhappy omen for our times to reflect that throughout history  wars have been declared with vigor  pomp and fanfare  but peace has often come tremulous  and uncertain. As the poet Milton reminded a famous military leader of his day  ""Peace hath her victories - No less renowned than war"". The primary objective of the United Nations requires  indeed  demands  that this Organization does not capitulate into defeatism where the preservation of peace is concerned. Jamaica has worked energetically  through two committees established at the national level - one of which I have the honor to be Chairman - to inculcate the ideals and promote activities related to the International Year of Peace. We affirm our support for this undertaking which serves to remind us that while new international problems may have arisen the old ones remain unsolved.Unfortunately  there has not been any significant change in the international situation. Military confrontations continue. The atmosphere of conciliation and co-operation is undermined. Opportunities through the United Nations system for closer contact and collaboration are ignored. Clearly any hope for peace has to come out of greater understanding and co-operation. The preservation of mankind demands a greater resolve to bring about solutions through meaningful dialog.We recognize the renewed efforts of the Soviet Union and the United states to hold discussions on arms control. There was a mood of optimism which followed the summit meeting in Geneva last November  and we welcome further attempts by theleaders of those two countries to resume the process of dialog. The process ofdialog may be slow  but we are convinced that it is only through patient diplomacy that any real understanding can be achieved. That has been demonstrated at the successful conclusion of negotiations at the Conference on security in Europe held in Stockholm. Jamaica continues to support positive steps towards arms control and disarmament. The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant earlier this year and its repercussions have once again impressed on us the threat posed to our existence by radiation. It is imperative that the process of nuclear disarmament be initiated  beginning with a comprehensive ban on nuclear-weapon tests. We must welcome the unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests proclaimed by one of the nuclear-weapon States  and it is our continued hope that its gesture will be matched by action on the part of other nuclear-weapon States  and lead to agreement on the cessation of those tests. The international effort to halt and reverse the arms race has the support of the overwhelming majority of mankind who are calling for peace and for the exercise of political will by Governments to bring an end to the wastage of resources on the accumulation of weapons.The tragic and futile war between Iran and Iraq continues. We urge the Secretary-General to continue to use his good offices to prevail upon those States to seek a peaceful end to this long drawn-out and bitter conflict. One of the more sinister aspects of this war has been the deplorable use of chemical weapons. We again urge the parties to the conflict and the international community to proceed more vigorously in their efforts to ban the use of chemical weapons.In the Middle East  the basic problem remains  but the need has become greater for a comprehensive and lasting settlement. We consider the question of Palestine as being central to the Middle East problem  and we do not envisage any lasting peace or stability in the region until the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and a homeland are realized. This  along with the termination of policies of occupation and annexation  would make it possible for all States in the region  including Israel  to exist in peace and security within internationally recognized boundaries.Although other efforts in the pursuit of peace in the region cannot be totally rejected  our view is that a comprehensive approach would be far more effective. We therefore continue to support the convening of an international conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations.The crisis in Central America is yet another issue of serious concern to Jamaica. We have always firmly supported the diplomatic initiatives of the Contadora Group in the search for a peaceful solution to the problem  and we continue to do so.In this regard we are pleased to hear of the recent announcement of the eight Latin American countries involved in the Contadora initiative that they will be meeting as soon as possible to develop a fresh strategy aimed at breaking the deadlock in the negotiations.The attainment of social  economic and political justice in South Africa and the threat to peace and stability in the southern African region as a whole remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Jamaica's full and total opposition to the brutal regime in Pretoria is well known; it was stated by the Prime Minister at the fortieth anniversary session  and more recently reiterated by the Deputy Prime Minister at the United Nations special session on Namibia held in this Kali a few weeks ago. We again call on the Security Council to impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa as a means of bringing the system of apartheid to an end. Over the past year  there has been increasing acceptance of the use of sanctions in this struggle. It is a tribute to the sound instinct and conscience of people everywhere that it is public opinion  not governments  which has taken the offensive. The recent decisions by the Commonwealth to impose further measures against South Africa rests on the conviction that sanctions are effective. Contrary to the belief of some  the Pretoria regime is indeed concerned about the possibility of comprehensive sanctions being imposed.Jamaica continues to be outraged and gravely concerned at the persistence of the appalling state of affairs in South Africa itself  and at Pretoria's unrelenting campaign of military aggression and destabilization attempts against the front-line States. Together with its latest attempts designed further to entrench its illegal presence in Namibia and forcibly to annex that Territory  Pretoria's policies and actions have had the inevitable effect of heightening the already alarming prospects of an open racial conflagration in that region  and constitutes a flagrant assault on the rule of international law  respect of human rights and civilized conduct among States.In Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Cyprus  the Korean Peninsula  Western Sahara and other areas where aggression  occupation  open conflict  or high levels of tension persist  the ideals of the Charter and the hope embodied in the initiative for an International Year of Peace go unfulfilled. Jamaica urges the parties to these conflicts to renew the search for peaceful solutions  and respond positively to the initiatives of the Secretary-General.Peace has many dimensions. Genuine and lasting peace will remain a chimera as long as the overwhelming majority of States and their peoples remain in a condition marked by poverty and lack of development.The challenge of development  along with disarmament and the maintenance of peace  remain the pre-eminent tasks of our time. Indeed  the need for international co-operation and for a constructive and positive role by this Organization is as pressing in international economic affairs as in the case of major social and political problems  to which I have just drawn attention. It is a genuine tragedy that this interdependence is not as fully recognized by the world community as it should be  and this particularly by the major economic Powers.The cost to developing countries in lost growth and retarded development is high. This has once again been demonstrated in no uncertain terms in 1985. Last year the recovery in industrial countries weakened. The United States in particular was unable to sustain its role as the locomotive of the world economy. Growth in that country fell from a robust 7.2 per cent in 1984 to 2.5 per cent in 1985. What were some of the consequences of this weakened recovery? Growth rates also fell sharply in the great majority of developing countries during 1985. Significantly  in light of the severe debt problem of many countries and the need to earn foreign exchange  growth in export volume in the developing world fell from 11 per cent in 1984 to a mere 2.3 per cent in 1985. Debt service ratios moved upwards as export volumes contracted. The terms of trade of developing countries declined during the year. Painfully for countries such as Jamaica  weakening demand in the industrial countries contributed to an 11 per cent fall in the price of non-oil primary commodity exports. Adverse developments also occurred in the case of manufactures exported from the developing countries. These rose only by 3.3 per cent in 1985 after having grown by a vigorous 16.6 per cent in 1984 when the recovery in the industrial countries was stronger.The metaphor needed here to describe this is hardly that oE ripple effect. Clearly  shifts in levels of growth and of demand in the industrial economies set in motion powerful economic forces which literally reverberate throughout the world economy. Not only must the international community recognize this  but it must understand that this force can be harnessed for good or ill.It is for this reason that the Jamaican Government is of the view that an historic opportunity now exists in the world economy. In the parlance of the day  a window of opportunity is present in North-South relations. We say this because economic developments during the 1980s  particularly severe recession of 1980-1982 and its worst manifestations  the debt crisis and the collapse of primary commodity prices  have also set in motion changes in the approaches to development and the economic management strategies of a growing number of developing countries.Structural adjustment and export diversification are being pursued. Budgets and current account deficits have been reduced. Efforts have been made to reduce or eliminate distortions in goods and factor markets. More realistic exchange rates have emerged. It has been a period of austerity  of sacrifice  of change. Midway through the decade it remains clear that despite their own vigorous efforts  sustained and widespread growth cannot be achieved in the developing countries without more robust growth in demand and in levels of financial flows from the industrial countries of the North.It is a matter of serious concern that precisely the opposite process is taking place. Recovery is slowing down in the industrial North. Data from the World Bank show that in 1985 net financial flows to developing countries declined from $55 billion to $42 billion. In addition  net private direct foreign investment from North to South has fallen by 28 per cent since 1981.Jamaica believes that it is paradoxical that  precisely during the period when in many developing countries the conditions exist or are being created for optimal cost-effective use of capital and financial flows from the North  the quantum of those resources has declined. We would urge the developed countries and the multilateral financial institutions to increase at this critical time the provision of financial resources to the developing countries. We emphasize that it is imperative that policies be adopted by the major developed countries that ensure sustained and strengthened recovery in the industrial North.In our view  this requires not only appropriate monetary and fiscal policies but the reduction of non-tariff trade barriers. More thought and attention should also be given by industrial countries to the redistribution and use of accumulated surpluses in a manner which serves to stimulate and promote development in the South. We are convinced that only under this scenario will developing countries be able to grow and service their debt.Many of the problems of the world economy remain acute. The burden of debt weighs heavily on many countries and remains a potential threat to the international financial system. Issues of protectionism  trade  commodity prices  resource flows and monetary reform remain on the agenda of the international community and must be addressed with creativity and vigour.In this context  we welcome the agreement recently reached at Punta del Este on the launching of a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round of multilateral trade negotiations. Next year  also  the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will provide an opportunity for the international community to address the areas of money  finance a trade and development in a comprehensive and integrated manner. We encourage all States to co-operate in order to ensure that this important meeting will be a success. The economies of the developing countries must be placed on a sustained growth path if the hopes and aspirations of mankind embodied in the Charter  which guides the work of the Organization  are to be fulfilled.These continuing  troublesome and often perplexing issues make it all the more necessary to have an efficient  responsive and viable United Nations. The effort at collective self-criticism has now resulted in the report of the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts. That report is welcome. It is one step in the right direction. We fi/id the recommendations thoughtful and thought-provoking. But it would be over-ambitious to expect this session of the Assembly to adopt all of them. There are sufficient contradictions and inconsistencies in the recommendations to make any such package impossible. Nevertheless  the Assembly must examine the report thoroughly. In so doing  Member States must be ever careful not to distort or derogate from the goals and principles of the Organization in our necessary and well-intentioned efforts to satisfy immediate concerns about administrative efficiency and financial soundness.Finally  Jamaica notes with satisfaction that progress is being made in the work of the Preparatory Commission in connection with the law of the sea. We are pleased that agreement has been reached on an understanding to overcome the problem of overlapping claims of the pioneer investors and we look forward to the registration of pioneer investors in the near future. This step will give increased credibility to the international regime for the sea-bed and will furtherdemonstrate the commitment of the international community to the Convention on the Law of the Sea.The history of man's ability to adapt to changing circumstances and environments gives up hope that the United Nations will respond to the new needs and challenges. Everything depends on us  the Member States. It is we who  having taken cognizance of the needs  will so organize ourselves and this institution that its worth will be un-questioned and unassailable.We look to the future of man  we look to the future of the United Nations  and we can only hope that the ability to adapt and the instinct for survival will prevail."
"73",3568,"JOR",41,1986," It gives me great pleasure to extend to you our heartfelt congratulations  Sir  on your election as President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your ability and diplomatic skill will enable you to conduct the business of the General Assembly in a very able manner and that will be a great help to all of us in achieving the positive results that we aspire to at this session. It is a source of particular pleasure that the representative of a friendly country  Bangladesh  with which my country  Jordan  has the closest relations of brotherhood  friendship  co-operation  assume that important international post.I should also like to extend my thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  who conducted the proceedings of the fortieth session of the General Assembly with extreme skill. His ability to deal with thorny international problems  thanks to his wide knowledge and creative democratic spirit  coupled with firmness and decisiveness  led to the outstanding success of that session. This was only to be expected of such a seasoned diplomat  steeped in multilateral diplomacy and with wide experience in United Nations affairs and activities.I also wish at the beginning of my statement to convey on behalf of the Government of Jordan our great appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his sincere and tireless efforts to enhance the role of the United Nations and help solve conflicts and crises which threaten the security of peoples and deplete the energies of countries. We shall give his proposals and observations on various issues the attention they fully deserve.We share the Secretary-General's great concern to ensure effectiveness of the United Nations and its adherence to its ideals and principles  as well as his sincere desire that its role be enhanced  so that it may remain not only a forum for discussion and the expression of views and positions  but also a means of achieving consensus  and possibly agreements on the serious challenges that face mankind. The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations last year  was an opportunity to evaluate the progress of this vital Organization. In the course of the celebrations emphasis was laid on the importance of action to solve outstanding international problems in a spirit of co-operation and harmony and on the common concern not to allow international crises to get out of hand and escape collective control. It is our view that the crisis in the United Nations and the proliferation of its resolutions are caused essentially by the worsening international situation and the chronic regional conflicts that remain unsolved.We should not start from a false premise. The real problem facing us is not the proliferation of united Nations resolutions or the expansion of its organs  important and urgent as dealing with such aspects may be. It is the proliferation of the problems besetting the nations of the world and the fact that they remain unsolved. Therefore the sound premise is not the impact of international conflicts on the United Nations but rather the need to settle such conflicts using the machinery in an effective way. The settlement of these conflicts would absolve the United Nations of blame.We must deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict and the situations in southern Africa  Kampuchea  Lebanon and Central America as threats to international peace and security which sap the resources of the peoples of those regions  rather than treat them as mere items on the United Nations agenda. The situation in the Middle East was dealt with in 1967 by a single resolution  namely  Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which Israel has refused to implement to this day. The United Nations has been unable to force Israel to comply with that resolution. In fact  Israel has escalated its practices and consolidated its occupation  thus forcing the United Nations to keep on reaffirming its resolutions.The United Nations crisis is part of a world crisis  which is a reflection rather than a cause of the worsening situation of international peace and security. Therefore  the way to start dealing with the United Nations crisis is to implement United Nations resolutions  not to rob them of all force and vigor.The usefulness and efficiency of the United Nations as a framework for co-operation among States was demonstrated once again when  in spite of the financial crisis imposed on it  it was able to organize the special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. That session was testimony to the need for collective action and multilateral co-operation. It also showed the importance and effectiveness of multilateral action when the will is there.We see in that a ray of hope that progress can be made towards a collective solution to the economic and political problems in other regions of the world. The United Nations can contribute to the settlement of explosive regional conflicts in the Middle East  southern Africa  Cyprus  Afghanistan and other areas. The Secretary-General is making strenuous and sincere efforts to that end. We support his efforts and call upon others to support and respond positively to them. The United Nations machinery can also be activated to deal with the question of disarmament and the control of nuclear weapons.The eighth summit conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries held at Harare has recently dealt with these questions. The countries of the third world emphasized the importance of enhancing the role of the United Nations and the need to tackle the problems that face us in a spirit of co-operation  trust  realism and frankness.While we continue to believe in the vital need for the existence of the United Nations  we feel  unfortunately  that there is a campaign being waged against this Organization. Although I do not want to go into the details of this campaign  I feel it is essentially unjust and prejudiced. The United Nations can be as strong and effective or as marginal and unimportant as we  the Member States  want it to be. I believe that one of the reasons for its weakness is to be found in the selectivity practised and the double standards observed by some in applying the principles of the Charter  in particular those calling for self-determination  non-use of force in international relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes.With regard to the financial crisis facing the United Nations  I feel that we can work together to find appropriate and practical solutions. We can be guided by the views suggested so far and by the outcome of our deliberations and consultations in this regard. I believe  however  that our aim in solving this current financial crisis  which we do not underestimate  should be to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the Organization rather than cast doubt on it or weaken it. For if it were to disappear  an international situation would arise in which force will take precedence over law.In the context of our commitment to the United Nations and our belief in its importance and effectiveness  we consider it necessary to provide it with adequate means to fulfill its role with regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict. So far  its role has largely been confined to that of an observer or of a non-active participant. The outcome of the struggle between right and might has been thefreezing of the United Nations role with regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict. In a situation in which the majority would not agree to set aside the principles of the Charter which reject aggression and domination while the minority refuses to permit the application of the provisions of the Charter against the aggressor. Therefore  the role of the international Organization has been confined to affirming the principles without being able to take any practical action in this conflict. There are those who benefit from this state of no-peace  no-war. Therein prevails a situation where the only winners have been those who refuse to give up anything and who would not accept less than everything. The only loser has been the Palestinian Arab people  who continue to languish under occupation.In this situation  where occupation is being consolidated  and the historical and inalienable rights of the Arab people have remained confined to theoretical reaffirmation  we in Jordan decided to do our utmost to change the situation so that the Arab rights in Palestine may be translated into practical reality  and the principles and resolutions of the United Nations condemning aggression  prohibiting foreign occupation and calling for self-determination may be translated into direct political action  through the formulation of practical solutions to the Palestine problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict.We have always been convinced that the mere affirmation of principles  the taking of postures and the issuance of declarations without practical efforts towards the achievement of what we aspire to often constitute a course of action that is no less dangerous than the outright occupation. There has developed a regional situation characterized by demographic and geographical changes in the occupied Arab territories; a state of international laxity and a feeling of inability to take any serious action against the creeping annexation of occupied Arab territories. This has been accompanied by a state of international polarization and rivalry between the super-Powers to control the region's destinyand resources. The situation of the Palestinian Arab people  languishing under occupation  has worsened to an unprecedented degree that gives rise to grave concern.For all these important considerations concerning the future of the Palestinian Arab people and the preservation of their national identity and of the Arab and Islamic rights in Palestine  Jordan has worked for a comprehensive  just and durable peace settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict  including the Palestine question  which is the core of the conflict  through an international conference attended by all parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Such a conference should be held under the auspices of the united Nations on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) .We feel that convening such a conference would provide the appropriate framework for negotiation on the basis of international law and the principles of the Charter. We consider that it would be a forum that could not be exploited as an arena either for debate or for polemics. It would rather be a solemn international framework for responsible negotiation and effective action to reach the desired settlement  one in which the parties would be held responsible for their actions before the whole world  and subjected to the scrutiny of the international community. We feel that the outcome of such a settlement should ensure Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories  guarantee the historic and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in their ancestral homeland  and guarantee the right of all States and peoples of the region  including Israel  to live in security and peace within internationally recognized boundaries.Our position has a firm foundation. First and foremost there is our belief in the inevitability of peace  and our national commitment to the Palestinian people with whom we are linked through a common historical background and the bonds of a common aim and destiny.In view of this special and distinctive relationship  we are the first to realize the true and sincere desire of the Palestinian people  languishing under occupation  to achieve a just and honorable peace. We therefore oppose the attempts that are being made to confine them to a cycle of violence  rejection and extremism whereby their enemies  that is the enemies of the Palestinian people  may be able to exclude and ignore them  and  even worse  to trample upon their rights under the pretext of combating violence and terrorism.That is why we have worked  together with our Palestinian brethren  towards the implementation of the Arab peace plan  which enjoys the support of an overwhelming majority  by creating practical machinery for the implementation of this plan. To this end  we signed an agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization on 11 February 1985  the bases and principles of which continue to constitute the starting-point of our orientation in relation to the Palestine question. It essentially guarantees the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization  the legitimate and sole representative of the Palestinian people  in peace-making and peace-keeping  if our efforts have met with obstacles placed by some  this should not provide an excuse for the international community to shirk its historical responsibility towards the Palestinian people and the achievement of peace. We should not allow Israel to use this as a pretext to deny the Palestinian people their legitimate rights and continue its policy of keeping the land  and hence impose  if possible  its version of peace  armed with unlimited political  military and economic support from the United States.The United Nations took on a special responsibility for the Palestine question when in 1947 it adopted the resolution to partition Palestine. The problem became even worse when the international Organization found itself unable to implement its 1948 resolution on the right of the Palestinian refugees to repatriation or compensation. It again found itself powerless when Israel occupied all of the Palestinian territory in 1967. It was unable to implement a comprehensive peace settlement based on the principle of non-admissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and to achieve peace in return for withdrawal. We cannot disregard the responsibility of the five permanent members of the Security Council in regard to this problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict which it caused. In 1947 the views of those States converged on partitioning Palestine - despite rivalries and struggles between them. In 1967 their views again converged on a fundamental concept - the concept of territory for peace - upon which to build a just and comprehensive peace  based on the principle of the non-admissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. That was the principle at the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) - reaffirmed by Security Council resolution 338 (1973)  which called for the implementation of resolution 242 (1967) by negotiations between the parties under appropriate auspices.The appropriate framework is provided by the General Assembly  the highest international authority  in which all the peoples of the world are represented and which is supported by everyone. This is reflected in the call for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East. We hope that the Security Council will support that call before it is too late  so that all the parties concerned may negotiate for peace. All those who oppose the convening of the international conference must understand that by their opposition they are only prolonging the Arab-Israeli conflict and  consequently  the suffering and anguish of the peoples of the Middle East  and are exposing the whole region to instability.The emergence of some response on the part of those who have taken positions in opposition to the convening of the conference confirms the fact that the position we took from the beginning is the right one and that the international conference  as proposed  remains the ideal way to achieve a just  lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Palestine question and the Arab-Israeli conflict.We in Jordan have never hesitated to condemn and denounce terrorism  regardless of its source or nature. We do not agree that attacks against the lives of innocent people in places of worship or while they are traveling can be condoned as being in accordance with international principles or civilized human behavior. We do  however  draw a distinction between such shameful acts and the legitimate national struggle waged by oppressed and colonized peoples and their liberation movements; the latter are approved by the principles of international law and in United Nations resolutions.On the other hand  we feel that attempting to place the stress on terrorist acts  which have recently escalated  instead of working to put an end to the Israeli occupation of Arab territory and achieving peace  can only contribute to increasing the tension already prevalent in the region. The attempt to reduce the Arab-Israeli conflict - with the aggression and occupation of Arab territory that it involves - to a mere problem of international terrorism can logically have only one result: creating new justification for more violence and more terrorism. One of the results of such a trend on the part of some quarters is that terrorism has become an aspect of the absence of peace and the continuation of the current deadlock; and some wish to use this as a pretext for ruling out a political settlement and dissociating themselves from attempts to achieve peace. That can only provide extremist and rejectionist parties with an excuse to exploit situations and encourage terrorism to serve their own schemes.In the Arab Gulf area  the Iraq-Iran war has entered its seventh year  and we still witness international impotence and indifference in regard to Iran's intransigence and obduracy. In spite of the unanimous recognition of the necessity to put an end to that war  the realization that it is futile and that there can be no justification for continuing it  and the possibility that it will spread  Iran continues to reject all appeals for the cessation of this devastating war. Iran has lately coupled its rejection of the various appeals for peace with a dangerous escalation of the war. In contrast to this  Iraq has made a positive response to all the peace initiatives aimed at ending the war. The President of Iraq  Mr. Saddam Hussein  put forward in August 1986 constructive proposals for ending the war with Iran.In welcoming this move towards peace by Iraq - which is extending its hand to peace from a position of strength - we call upon Iran to reciprocate by making a similar positive move in order that an honorable and just solution acceptable to both parties may be achieved  a solution which would spare the two countries and their peoples further killing  destruction and depletion of resources.The continuation of that war not only constitutes a danger to the welfare and safety of the Iraqi and Iranian peoples  but also threatens regional and international security. Furthermore  it constitutes defiance of the United Nations and contributes to weakening it. In that regard  we must condemn all attempts designed to prolong and fuel this war  in particular by supporting and backing the intransigent party that refuses to end it.In sister Lebanon  the plight of the Lebanese people has lasted for over 10 years. It has been worsened by Israel's expansionist policy and its repeated acts of aggression - in particular  its illegal presence in southern Lebanon  which threatens Lebanon's sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity. Israel is using the area as a stepping stone for continued interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon and the whole region. We hope that Lebanon will be able verysoon to restore its sovereignty and independence as a result of the complete withdrawal from Lebanese territory of all Israeli forces  thereby making it possible for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to discharge its mandate under Security Council resolution 425 (1978).Our concern with the deteriorating situation in the Middle East in no way prevents us from paying attention to the deteriorating situations in other regions of the world  be they in Africa  Central America  Asia or the Mediterranean.We stand firmly at the side of our brothers in the African continent against the racist and colonialist policies of South Africa  manifested in the apartheid regime and the occupation of Namibia. We oppose such policies firmly and strongly and support all the measures recommended and adopted by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations to put an end to the obnoxious apartheid regime in South Africa and to achieve independence for Namibia in accordance with the United Nations plan on this subject. We are also in favor of supporting the African front-line States materially and politically in their confrontation with the expansionist policy of South Africa.We also support the efforts of the Contadora Group to bring to an end the conflict and tension in Central America  so that the peoples and States of the region may devote themselves to the economic and social development of which they are in dire need.The principles which govern Jordan's foreign policy of support for the right of peoples to self-determination  resistance to foreign occupation  rejection of the use of force in international conflicts  and adherence to the peaceful settlement of disputes  are the constants of our position towards all urgent regional conflicts  in Kampuchea  Afghanistan and elsewhere.Prom this standpoint  we welcome the efforts of the two Koreas towards the reunification of their territory by peaceful means and dialog  in accordance with the three principles enunciated in the joint communique of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  dated 4 July 1973. We welcome their joining the international community. We also support the efforts of the Secretary-General to solve the question of Cyprus With regard to the situation in Afghanistan  we hope that the efforts of the Secretary-General  which are aimed at achieving a speedy settlement of the problem  will succeed and ensure the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghan territory  the return of Afghan refugees and emigrants  and the safeguarding of the independence and territorial integrity of this friendly country.Finally  in this complex and unstable international situation characterized by fluctuations in the relations between the super-Powers  oscillating between from detente and cold war  with the consequent potential for a world confrontation that would threaten all mankind  in addition to a weakening of belief in the principle of multilateralism  and the danger this engenders for the future of the United Nations  which personifies the hope of mankind for a more secure life free fromwant and poverty. In view of the worsening of the world economic situation and the tense regional situation in the Middle East - where there is such a bleak international and regional climate that dangerous phenomena are emerging  such as the attempts of the forces of extremism and aggression to dominate the area and the efforts of some to live at the expense of others  rather than coexist with them -in view of all this  Jordan maintains its balanced action and objective and creative thinking  advocating coexistence with all  rather than some living at the expense of others. It is determined to make its voice heard and to listen to others  whether friend or foe  and in the face of all adversities is ready to accept sacrifices in the service of its principles and consistent position.We do so  armed with a balanced  moderate and objective vision regarding the problems that face us in our region and in the world at large. We work hand in hand with the forces of good  in solidarity with the champions of peace and united with our Palestinian brothers and family to whom we are linked by a distinctive historical relationship.This is the message of Jordan. I place it before the Assembly  the representatives of the world's States and peoples. It is a message of a peaceful policy based on right and justice and the desire to live and let live. It is a peaceful balanced initiative that should be lasting to achieve peace in a country where it has been absent and render justice to a people to which it has been denied for several decades  namely  the Palestinian people  and eliminate the challenge posed to a nation that will not allow itself to be treated unjustly or treat othersunjustly  namely  the Arab nation. Peace and security for all  not peace and security for some at the expense of others."
"74",3615,"JPN",41,1986,"I should like first  on behalf of the Government and people of Japan  to. express my sincere congratulations to Mr Choudhury on his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am certain that this session will be a truly fruitful one  benefiting immensely from his rich experience  keen insight and decisiveness as it deals with the many difficult problems before it. As a fellow Asian  I assure him that the delegation of Japan will co-operate in every possible way to help him in carrying out his important duties.At the same time  I must express our -sincere appreciation to the President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  for the excellent manner in which he has discharged his responsibilities. Likewise  I should like to take this opportunity to pay high tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who has been working tirelessly to resolve numerous international problems  and in so doing has traveled to all corners of the world.Before beginning my formal remarks today  I should like to express Japan's heartfelt sympathies to the people of Cameroon  particularly those who have suffered as a result of the toxic gas released from Lake Nios. Itself a country of many volcanoes  Japan immediately dispatched a survey team to see what could be done to alleviate suffering and to prevent similar incidents in the future. Japan stands ready to consider additional relief assistance as necessary.I should also like to express our sincere sympathies to the many people who are suffering as a result of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union last April. This accident has served to highlight anew the very serious international responsibilities of all countries that use nuclear energy  and in this context I wish to commend the International Atomic Energy Agency  which has expeditiously drawn up draft conventions for dealing with future accidents of a similar nature.On the occasion of the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations last year  delegates from around the globe spoke to the world from this podium of the founding principles of the United Nations  its raison d'etre  and its problems. Having weathered four decades  the United Nations became the focus of renewed attention from all quarters.The major theme of the deliberations last year was a reaffirmation of the United Nations' increasingly important role in the search for world peace and prosperity. As was suggested by Prime Minister Nakascne  the United Nations is the perfect vehicle for promoting mutual appreciation and res per . among the various cultures of the world and for building a new and harmonious civilization for the twenty-first century.Yet  concern has been expressed that the United Nations might suffer functional paralysis should it fail to promptly achieve the reforms necessary to rectify the very serious administrative and financial situation  caused in part by organizational over-expansion.At the fortieth session of the General Assembly my predecessor  Foreign Minister Abe  squarely addressed this problem and proposed that a group of eminent persons be established in an effort to revitalize the organization and functions of the United Nations. This proposal was based on our conviction that the United Nations is essential to the whole international community  including  of course  r.».y country  and was an expression of Japan's steadfast support for this indispensable world Organization.Happily  Foreign Minister Abe's proposal was accepted by the Member States  and the 18-member Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts was established. Bringing to their work superior wisdom  rich experience  and a thorough knowledge of the acute problems facing the United Nations  this Group has labored intensively to produce the report it recently submitted to the Secretary-General. None of the similar efforts to reform the United Nations in the past has produced as comprehensive and constructive a report as the one submitted by this Group. I wish to pay sincere tribute to all its members. The determination and vigor with which they accomplished their task are  indeed  the very attributes needed for the revitalization of this Organization.The Group's report contains many constructive recommendations for making the United Nations a more efficient organization  and I wholeheartedly support them. I very much hope that at this forty-first session the Assembly will consider these recommendations and that they will be implemented as soon as possible with the support of all Member States. The United Nations should then be able to regain the trust of all the peoples of the world  gain the ability to respond promptly and effectively to any situation that may arise  and in this way serve as a model for all the bodies within the United Nations system.What  then  should the United Nations do once it has begun to function more effectively and efficiently? What should it do to eliminate conflicts and famine  and to eradicate terrorism which has recently claimed so many victims  so that ordinary people throughout the world may live a peaceful and prosperous life  free from anxiety?What the world today expects of the United Nations is  first  the maintenance of international peace and security  and  second  international co-operation for economic  social and cultural development. But as we witness these issues it is impossible not to address also the question of disarmament.If members will allow me to interject a personal note  I was born and raised in the city of Nagasaki in south-west Japan. Nagasaki was well known as Japan's only foreign trade port during its two and a half centuries of national seclusion  from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. In the final days of the Second World War  Nagasaki again became famous as the only other city besides Hiroshima to have been the target of an atomic bomb.Returning home soon after the war's end  I was confronted with the rubble that was once Nagasaki and with the misery of its people. I joined the local government in order to put all of my energies into rebuilding the city. At the same time  having witnessed the effect of this awesome weapon  I began to give serious thoughtnot only as a public servant but also as a concerned individual  to the questions of how to maintain peace in the nuclear age and how to deliver mankind from the nuclear threat. When I think about the destruction wrought by nuclear weapons  I am unshakable in my conviction""  all nuclear weapons must be abolished.Voicing such a belief is easy. Today's world would be different if statements or declarations in and of themselves could bring about true peace and the abolition of nuclear weapons. What is important are deeds. However modest  concrete and steady action alone can contribute to peace and the abolition of nuclear weapons.The nuclear super-Powers have especially grave responsibilities in this effort to save mankind from the nuclear threat. President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev at their summit meeting last November agreed that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Before concrete action to reduce nuclear weapons can be taken  it is necessary to establish relations of mutual political trust between the States concerned. The East-West political dialog  with impetus from last year's United States-Soviet summit  has begun to be held at a higher level and with greater frequency  and this is an important first step towards the establishment of such mutual trust. It has become a major responsibility of all countries participating in the East-West political dialog  including Japan  to ensure that it bears fruit.For every country the issue of disarmament  including nuclear disarmament  is inextricably linked to its own security; thus we must bear in mind that any special proposal for nuclear disarmament which does not give due consideration to the security interests of other parties would be counterproductive and would undermine mutual trust.Moreover  we believe that a satisfactory system of verification must be established to ensure compliance with disarmament and arms control agreements and to strengthen relations of mutual trust. My country  in its efforts to achieve a comprehensive nuclear test ban  has proposed a step-by-step approach to the establishment of an effective verification system. Following up this proposal  Japan proposed at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva last April that more detailed seismic data should be exchanged in order to enhance verification capabilities and interested countries will begin doing so on an experimental basis this December. I hope that these efforts will greatly contribute to the goal of a comprehensive nuclear test ban.In dealing with the nuclear problem  we must face the reality that the existing nuclear balance works as a deterrent. It is therefore necessary  while continuing the dialog to build up mutual trust  to make steadfast efforts gradually to reduce nuclear stockpiles without upsetting a proper balance. I am convinced that that is the only way we can hope to abolish ultimately all nuclear weapons and ensure that the people of Nagasaki will be the last to experience the horror of a nuclear attack.In view of the especially grave responsibilities of the two nuclear super-Powers on this issue of peace and disarmament  I sincerely hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will hold a second summit meeting soon  as agreed last November  and that major progress will be made towards resolving the various issues between them  including that of nuclear disarmament and arms control.We should also like to see a redoubling of international efforts at the United Nations  at the Conference on Disarmament and elsewhere  to reach concrete agreements in the field of disarmament  including especially a comprehensive nuclear test ban and a ban on the use of chemical weapons. We should strive also to preserve and strengthen the regime of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. I renew my pledge that Japan will contribute actively to such efforts in those forums  including this General Assembly session.Having stated Japan's basic position on the issue of disarmament in general  I must here say a few words about the SS-20s that the Soviet Union has deployed in Asia. Japan very strongly hopes that the negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces between the United States and the Soviet Union will deal with SS-20s on a global basis and lead to their total elimination  both in Asia and in Europe.While Japan has long hoped to establish stable relations based upon mutual understanding with its important neighbor  the Soviet Union  it is essential first to resolve the territorial issue still pending since the Second World War and to conclude a peace treaty embodying that settlement. I am confident that resolving this territorial issue would contribute significantly to peace and stability in the Far East and throughout Asia.Along with the issue of disarmament  the question of how to resolve regional problems and local conflicts has an important bearing on the issue of world peace. Although the primary goal of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security  there have been over 150 local conflicts since it was founded  many of which still continue without any sign of abatement.I should like to turn now to some of the regional problems that confront the international community and Japan's policy regarding them.One of the most urgent among those problems is how to induce the Government of South Africa to abandon its policy of apartheid. This is an issue on which the entire international community must focus its attention.Barring the vast majority of the South African people from participating in the political process and subjecting them to numerous other forms of discrimination simply because of the color of their skin  apartheid is absolutely intolerable to all who share mankind's ideal of respect for human rights. I am gravely concerned that the situation in South Africa is rapidly deteriorating because its Government not only persists in practising apartheid but also has taken to such reprehensible acts as attacking neighboring countries and has declared a state of emergency throughout its territory. The situation in South Africa must be resolved by peaceful means  and it is imperative that all parties concerned make every effort to avoid further bloodshed.The Government of South Africa has recently announced a series of reform measures but  regrettably  they are not the basic reforms needed to effect the abolition of apartheid. Japan has availed itself of every opportunity strongly to urge the Government of South Africa to have the courage to take decisive political action to abolish apartheid immediately  free Nelson Mandela  legalize the African National Congress and other political organizations and enter into discussions with black leaders.Japan maintains no diplomatic relations with South Africa  limiting its relations to the consular level. It has imposed restrictions on relations with that country in a wide range of fields. For example  Japan prohibits direct investment; it prohibits the export of weapons and computers; it has adopted trade restrictions such as those on the import of South African gold coins; and it severely restricts sports and cultural contacts. On 19 September my Government announced its decision to take additional steps until such time as the Government of South Africa announced clear and specific measures to abolish apartheid. These include a prohibition on the import of iron and steel  restrictions on tourist travel between Japan and South Africa  the continuation of the suspension of air links with South Africa and a prohibition on the use of international flights of South African Airways by government officials.While taking these measures against South Africa Japan intends to step up its economic co-operation with other countries in the region which may encounter economic difficulties as a result of developments in South Africa. Japan will also expand and strengthen its co-operative efforts to enhance the status of SouthAfrica's black population.Similarly  Japan deplores South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia and webelieve that illegal situation must be ended as soon as possible. Namibian independence should be achieved in full accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions 385 (""1976) and 435 (1978)  which constitute the only acceptable basis for a peaceful  just and enduring settlement. Japan hopes that elections for independence will be held under United Nations supervision and that soon oome when we will be able to welcome Namibia to United Nationsthe day will membership.As for the situation in Afghanistan  Japan strongly appeals to the countries concerned to come to an agreement  through positive co-operation  with the good offices of the United Nations  for the prompt withdrawal of all Soviet military forces  the restoration of the Afghan people's right to self-determination  and a safe and honorable return for the refugees. In this connection we support the efforts of the Secretary-General in the proximity talks for the resolution of this problem.It is likewise most regrettable that the situation between Iran and Iraq remains tense  with hostilities between them continuing and even showing signs of intensifying and posing a major hazard to shipping in the Gulf. I appreciate the efforts made by the Security Council for a peaceful solution of this conflict  and call upon the Council to continue to play a just and more active role. I should also point out once again the need for both Iran and Iraq to respond to these Security Council efforts by appearing before the Council and stating their positions there. I support the efforts of the Secretary-General towards a solution of this conflict  and hope a way will be found to open a dialog between the two parties. Japan intends to continue its efforts  in co-operation with like-minded countries  to create a climate conducive to peace between Iran and Iraq.Peace in the Middle East is one of the oldest and most tragic of the problems with which the United Nations has grappled. In order that a just  lasting and comprehensive peace may be achieved in the Middle East  I strongly hope that all of the parties concerned will redouble their efforts with a view to peace. Japan appreciates the sincere efforts of the parties concerned to attain peace  efforts exemplified by the decision to make 1987 the year of negotiations for peace. I assure the Assembly that Japan will also do everything it can to realize peace in the Middle East. in Central America  Japan hopes that the regional efforts will soon yield a peaceful solution. In this context  we strongly support the efforts of the Contadora Group and other forces for peace in the region.I find it most deplorable that  despite the resolutions adopted every year by the overwhelming majority of the General Assembly  the situation in Kampuchea remains unresolved and continues to pose a major threat to peace and stability in Asia. Japan has long called for an early and comprehensive political solution of the Kampuchean problem  based on the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and on the exercise of the rights of self-determination by the Kampuchean people. It strongly supports the efforts of the ASEAN countries to this end. At the same time  Japan will continue its dialog with Viet Nam and all of the other countries concerned in an active effort to create a climate conducive to peace in Indo-China.The situation on the Korean peninsula  just a short stretch of water away fromJapan  continues to be tense.Because this problem is one that should be peacefully resolved primarilythrough direct talks between North and South Korea  it is unfortunate that North Korea continues to be opposed to the resumption of talks. Japan hopes that substantive dialog between the two sides will be resumed as soon as possible.The 10th Asian Games are currently being held in Seoul with the participation of a large number of young people from throughout Asia. Prime Minister Nakasone's attendance at the opening ceremonies is a demonstration of Japan's full support for the Games  in the belief that their success  as a prelude to the 1988 Seoul Olympics  will contribute to the stabilization of the situation on the Koreanpeninsula.Japan has often indicated that if both North and South would consider joining the United Nations as a step towards the reunification of the Korean peninsula  itwould welcome and support their membership. This would contribute to relaxing tensions and enhancing the principle of universality the United Nat-ions. Considering that both North and South have already joined a number of United Nations specialized agencies  I believe the time is ripe for the Organization to admit both North and South as Members.Each of these regional disputes and local conflicts has its own distinct cause  its own complex history  and it would be extremely difficult to solve them all at once. However  the United Nations must by no means remain a bystander. It is true that the United States and the Soviet Union play a major role in the maintenance of international peace and security. This does not mean  however  that these super-Powers are the only determining factors and that there is little the United Nations can do.Just as it would be a mistake to overestimate the ability of the United Nations as peace-keeper  so would it be wrong to disregard or underestimate its potential as an effective force in this field. In fact  the United Nations has already contributed to preventing and containing conflicts in a number of critical situations.Japan believes that the peace-keeping role of the United Nations should be strengthened  and in this regard I wish to make two points.First  it is imperative that all the Member States of the Organization continue to work seriously to revitalize the Security Council. In particular  I appeal strongly to its permanent members to join together to take positive steps to strengthen its functioning and to fulfill the grave responsibilities that go with their privileges.Secondly  we the Member States must reaffirm the role that the United Nations organs can play in the maintenance of peace and security  and seek ways in which each of our roles can be integrated with those of the United Nations. Given the way the Security Council  the General Assembly  and the Secretary-General have contributed to the prevention of conflicts through their fact-finding  informal contacts and good offices  it would seem that the most practical approach to strengthening the united Nations peacekeeping role would be to enhance these functions.In this connection  I should like to refer to the working paper on the prevention of conflicts  which Japan and five other Member States prepared in response to the appeals by the Secretary-General  particularly in his annual reports. The working paper  which has been studied for three years by the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations  is aimed at enhancing the role which the main united Nations organs can play within the framework of the Charter for the purpose of preventing conflicts from arising and eliminating the threat of conflict  thereby promoting the fullest possible use of the peacekeeping functions of the United Nations as a whole. I sincerely hope that this working paper will be adopted as a declaration of the General Assembly as soon as possible. In this way  every Member State would reaffirm the importance of world peace and its own commitment to the role of the United Nations.It is by no means easy to strengthen the United Nations peace-keeping functions. Yet I would recall here the words of Mr. Cordell Hull  the United States Secretary of State during the Second World War and a founding father of the United Nations  who said that what this Organization needed was time  perseverance and a spirit of co-operation. It is precisely in these trying times  when the interests of countries are so intertwined  that we must  as suggested by Mr. Hull  seek to make the United Nations not a forum for acrimonious debate but a place where through tenacious effort we can explore  devise and implement solutions to the many problems that confront us.Along with its peace-keeping functions  the United Nations also has an important role to play in promoting social and economic development world-wide  especially in developing countries. Given that many regional conflicts are sparked by poverty and starvation  it is impossible to overemphasize the importance of that role. The developing countries of Latin America  Asia  Oceania and Africa are facing severe economic difficulties as a result  for example  of the collapse in commodity prices and their burgeoning external debts  and I am concerned that those difficulties may endanger political stability in those regions. Japan is determined to extend as much assistance as it can to those developing countries as they strive to overcome their economic difficulties.On the question of-multilateral trade negotiations  I am pleased to report that agreement to launch a new round was reached at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Ministerial Conference held just last week at Punta del Este. Steady expansion of exports is of primary importance for the sound economic growth of developing countries  and I am confident that improvements in the trading environment resulting from progress in this new round will work to their benefit. As for Japan  we are continuing our positive efforts to further improve market access and to stimulate domestic demand. Our imports of manufactures and other products from developing countries are on the increase  especially with the recent appreciation of the yen  and we intend to step up our efforts for economic structural adjustment and to expand our trade with those countries.Despite its difficult financial straits  Japan has committed itself to disbursing at least 340 billion over the seven-year period from 1986 to 1992  and in 1992 to providing double the amount of official development assistance it extended in 1985  in accordance with its Third Medium-Term Target. That commitment was made in keeping with Japan's policy of actively supporting the self-reliant efforts of developing countries towards economic and social growth and improved standards of living and welfare. Japan stands ready to offer all possible support to ensure that the economic difficulties in developing countries do not seriouslyhinder their development plans.In order to ensure that our co-operation with the developing countries' self-reliant efforts is managed properly  effectively  and efficiently  it is imperative that they themselves draw up development plans consistent with changing conditions and their development needs. It is also important that there be in-depth policy dialog on those development plans  and that arrangements be made to facilitate dynamic co-operation between the donor and recipient countries in a genuine partnership. It will then be possible for Japan and the developing countries to draw up assistance and co-operation programs best suited to the development needs and conditions of the latter and establish a genuine partnership between than.Humanitarian relief assistance to peoples in danger of starvation or suffering from natural disasters is another important part of Japanese official development assistance. Based on our experiences in connection with last year's earthquake in Mexico and the volcanic eruption in Colombia  Japan has strengthened its system for providing overseas emergency relief in order to respond faster and more fully to major natural disasters  including the dispatch of teams of experts  and in addition to extending financial assistance. We shall work to further improve that system. At the same time  Japan has in recent years rapidly expanded its assistance to the fa mine-ravaged countries of Africa.The United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development adopted unanimously at the special session on Africa last May provided useful medium- and long-term guidelines for the self-reliant development efforts of African countries and for international support for those efforts. I am particularly encouraged that the members of the Organization for African Unity have expressed their determination to stand on their own feet and overcome Africa's economic difficulties. Taking fully into account that program of Action  Japan is determined to contribute positively to Africa's medium- and long-term development by supporting  in particular  efforts to promote agricultural development and to make Africa self-sufficient in foodstuffs. We also very much hope that the constructive and realistic attitudes of all the countries concerned demonstrated at the special session on Africa will be followed up in the future North-South dialog.Japan has also sought to enhance its voluntary contributions to the United Nations Development program (UNDP) and other programs for economic and technical co-operation within the United Nations system. As a result  Japan is now the largest or second largest contributor to many of the reading assistance organizations. For the future  we intend to continue our efforts to better co-ordinate our bilateral co-operation with multilateral programs such as the UNDP in order to enhance not only the quantity but also the efficiency of our assistance. We will do all we can to tailor our contributions to the real needs of the recipient countries.This year commemorates the 30th anniversary of Japan's admission to the United Nations. In the three decades that have passed since then  the Government and people of Japan have consistently sought  in light of our bitter experience  to make co-operation with and support for the United Nations a key part of Japan's foreign policy. We recall that all Member states  upon admission to the United Nations  solemnly pledged to act in conformity with the purposes and principles of the (United Nations Charter  accent the duties and responsibilities set forth therein  and use all the means at their command to fulfill those duties and responsibilities. Yet  we see today conflicts in many parts of the world that probably could have been averted had the parties rigorously observed those purposes and principles. I should like therefore to appeal most strongly to those countries to remember their vows to the united Nations  to renew their commitment to the principles of the Charter  to resolve their conflicts peacefully  and to direct their energies to the creation of a better world.In less than 14 years  we shall enter the 21st century. We can either cooperate to bequeath to this United Nations  which is the most universal organization ever created by mankind  or in clamoring for our own interests we can let the Organization crumble like the Tower of Babel. The choice before us is clear."
"75",3687,"KEN",41,1986," Permit me  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  to congratulate you. Sir  most warmly on your election to preside over the deliberations of the forty-first session of the General Assembly and the recently concluded fourteenth special session on the Question of Namibia. X am particularly pleased to see you  a sen of Bangladesh  a country with which Kenya shares a common historical experience and fruitful bonds of friendly relations  assume the high office of the presidency of our Organization. We are confident that your vast experience and diploma tic dexterity  coupled with the assistance of your able officers  will guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion. Let me also take this opportunity to extend a well deserved tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Pinies of Spain  for his able stewardship of the fortieth anniversary session of the United Nations General Assembly and the thirteenth special session on the critical economic situation in Africa.Similarly  I should like to pay tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General  and his staff  for the good service they have faithfully continued to render to the international community. We recognize that the work of this body would be impossible to accomplish without the able and dedicated service of the Secretariat staff led by the Secretary-General  who  in the execution of his important responsibilities  has demonstrated both foresight and tenacity of purpose.Last year the international community celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  when statesmen and other leaders reaffirmed their dedication to the noble and high ideals that inspired the founding fathers of our Organization. Kenya reiterated its commitment  highlighting some of the achievements of the United Nations  such as the implementation of the process of decolonization  prevention of global conflict  peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance withthe accepted norms and principles of international law  promotion and respect of human rights and fostering of international economic co-operation. We also reflected on what we felt were significant shortcomings which impede the full realization of the lofty goals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Regrettably) during this forty-first session  we still find many long-standing disputes eluding solutions and strong resistance in the negotiation process to bring to an end such evils as apartheid and the last vestiges of colonialism. On the economic scene  we find the economies of nany countries still crushed under the weight of unfavorable terms of trade and external debt crisis.The Charter of the United Nations exhorts states to adhere to and act in conformity with the obligations imposed by international law  and respect the fundamental principles enunciated in the Charter. However  we note with a tinge of sadness the emergence of a dangerous trend  where nations are abandoning the machinery laid down by the Charter in favor of acts which sometimes amount to coercion  aggression and illegal use of armed force. My delegation wishes to re-emphasize the need to uphold the supremacy of law in the conduct of international relations.When the many challenges which continue to face the world are viewed against our experience over the past several decades  the process of multilateralism and the role of the United Nations in that process become both apparent and compelling. Yet just when the world needs to strengthen multilateralism and the United Nations  both seem to have come under cynical attack. We are witnessing more instances of unilateralism and the erosion of support for the United Nations  as evidenced by the crisis through which the Organization is going and which necessitated the resumption of the fortieth session of the General Assembly.Although the crisis is described as financial  it must be quite obvious to all of us by now that the United Nations is facing one of its worst political crises yet  a crisis of which the financial difficulties being encountered are mere symptoms. It is therefore incumbent upon all Member States to demonstrate their faith and commitment to our Organization in deeds rather than in words. Kenya  for its part  welcomes the report of the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts entrusted by the General Assembly at its fortieth session with studying ways and means of enhancing the effectiveness of the financial and administrative capabilities of the United Nations. In the group's recommendations  we find a number of positive-elements which deserve serious consideration by this Assembly. We look forward to working with others to find durable and generally acceptable solutions to the problems facing the Organization so that it may better serve the international community. However  if that endeavor is to succeed  we must all accept and recognize the fundamental fact that ours is first and foremost a political organization with many tasks. At the same time  our efforts to reform and reactivate the Organization must be strictly in accordance with the Charter. In Africa we are deeply disturbed that our continent is currently facing a greater threat to its political stability than ever before. That threat stems from the fact that the obnoxious racist regime in South Africa has not only intensified its brutality against those seeking freedom and justice within its borders and in Namibia but has also arrogated to itself the right to launch aggression and inflict murder and destruction against its immediate neighbors. We in the rest of Africa cannot remain indifferent when our brothers and sisters continue to be subjected to vicious assaults for crimes of which they are innocent  and to constant threats to their national security. The front-line States continue on a daily basis to suffer from the racist regime's acts of destabilization and direct military aggression  a flagrant breach of the principles of the United Nations Charter relating to respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States. These aggressive and illegal acts brutally committed by the racist regime have led to increasing loss of innocent life and of property beyond that regime's borders.In South Africa itself  an explosive situation currently obtains  a situation without any doubt as a direct result of the continued existence of the evil system of apartheid  which has been universally condemned and which has been declared a crime against mankind. Moreover  having carefully scrutinized the policies of apartheid  the international community long ago concluded that apartheid is an evil which cannot be reformed and which must  therefore  be dismantled. In that connection I wish to emphasize the words spoken by my President  His Excellency Mr. Daniel Toroiticharap Moi  when he addressed the General Assembly at its thirty-sixth session in his capacity as then Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAD). He stated that""Across the whole spectrum of impact and meaning  apartheid lies as an anguish upon the conscience of all civilized men. It violates those universal principles of human dignity and conduct which the United Nations has been authorized to codify and to harness. And there is no doubt that it affronts the very foundation of international law. On those three grounds alone  and there are many more  the only conclusion to be reached is that apartheid must be destroyed. In any case  there should never be any compromise with evil - and apartheid is  in every aspect  evil."" (A/36/PV.11  p. 11) Those words are as valid today as they were then.By now it is clear that consensus has emerged at the international level that the system of apartheid must be dismantled. Regrettably  however  the various measures proposed to accelerate the demise and destruction of apartheid have met with stubborn resistance  particularly by the racist regime itself and by those who have chosen to make compromises with apartheid  particularly the regime's allies and major trading partners. That resistance has made it impossible for the Security Council to agree unanimously on the measures necessary to undo apartheid. We firmly maintain that there is a moral duty on the part of every country and people to do its utmost to achieve the total destruction of this abhorrent system. To make compromises with it would lead us to catastrophic situations that we should all live to regret.Attempts to induce the Security Council impose comprehensive sanctions against racist South Africa because of the racist regime's arrogant defiance of the will of the international community to dismantle apartheid have time and again been subjected to veto. While the Security Council remains in a stalemate on this question the situation in South Africa has continued to deteriorate. The racist Pretoria regime has shamelessly and relentlessly intensified its repressive measures against all those opposed to the evil system  especially the blackpopulation of the country. It has entrenched its brutality  particularly by the recent proclamation of a state of emergency in a number of black townships and districts. In this way the racist regime hopes to frustrate and impede the rising tide of resistance and the escalation of the liberation struggle. Yet despite all this the struggle has gained momentum and intensity in the effort to secure freedom and independence in a free  multiracial South Africa.We are keenly aware of the enormous sacrifices the oppressed and suffering peoples of South Africa and Namibia are called upon to make because of an unfortunate  deliberate ""accident"" of history. We say this because most delegations from former colonial countries represented here have had their share of experience in the freedom struggle or are the offspring of freedom fighters. For them  the tribulations of a liberation struggle need not be emphasized. Independent Africa has proved to the world that racial harmony and respect for human rights can be achieved even after extreme intolerance and brutality. With this experience behind us  we find it imperative to remind the South African regime and its allies that majority rule does not of necessity lead to acrimonious relations. At this juncture it is pertinent to underscore the fact that the liberation struggle cannot and must not be confused with terrorism or indiscriminate violence  which we all condemn. The liberation struggle going on in that part of the world is the last resort of an oppressed people denied all other peaceful avenues. Moreover  history has demonstrated very clearly that a war of liberation against colonialism and racism will always triumph  because it is a just war.In the struggle to liberate South Africa and Namibia from the tentacles of apartheid we salute  and declare our unwavering solidarity with  the peoples of South Africa and Namibia in their struggle against oppression  exploitation and thedenial of the exercise of their inaJ tenable right of self-determination  fie therefore demand the unconditional and immediate release of Nelson Mandela and all other political parishioners and detainees  so that they can participate fully in the political process in South Africa} the immediate lifting of the state of emergency and other oppressive measures; the lifting of the ban on the liberation movements operating both inside and outside South Africa  and the immediate and complete dismantling of apartheid.Since the racist regime has consistently defied with impunity the call by the international community to dismantle apartheid  the only peaceful alternative is the imposition of sanctions against the obnoxious racist regime. We must uncompromisingly insist that the Security Council impose comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations  as called for at the World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  recently held at Paris.It is clear to everyone that the arrogance of the minority racist regime in South Africa stems from its relative military superiority  coupled with the economic and political support it enjoys from a number of its Western allies and friends. That support to the racist regime has fostered the false belief that the regime can continue indefinitely to defy the rest of the world with impunity. That arrogance must be brought to an end; we must act now.The Assembly is meeting at a most crucial period in the history of southern Africa? it is meeting against a background of a rapidly deteriorating situation in that region. South Africa has been experiencing the most widespread  persistent and destructive unrest in its post-war history. In the past two years alone  more than 2 000 people have lost their lives  many in clashes with the so-called security forces or through State-inspired violence. Thousands have been injured. Since the Government declared a new state of emergency in June this year  at least 12 000 people have been indefinitely detained. Schoolchildren of all ages  including some as young as six years  estimated to number 2 000  are today languishing in detention camps in conditions reminiscent of Hitler's concentration camps.Unfortunately  while these violations of human rights are going on in South Africa and Namibia  and while this obnoxious regime continues its repressive defense of the status quo  the burning moral issue of human rights violations is being deliberately watered down by a highly dramatized opposition to the efficacy of sanctions  without any definition by those who profess to value democracy  human rights  individual liberty and equality of what alternative measures should be taken to fulfill the moral obligations. To dismantle this universally condemned system of race classification and subjugation  condemnation and expression of repugnance alone are not sufficient. Vocal opposition without tangible measures is hollow. In any case  change in South Africa will come about  and it is a question of vital importance how it comes about. He hope members of the Assembly will be counted on Africa's side. We salute an ever-growing section of the world community that has been taking a principled stand by imposing various forms of sanctions.With regard to the international Territory of Namibia  illegally occupied by the racist regime of South Africa  much has been said over the years in various international forums  including this body. It is therefore not ray intention to rehearse it agin or dwell on the sad history of South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia. But let ae underline a few points that are crucial to this question and that the Assembly should always bear in mind as we deliberate on the course of action that now must be taken to ensure that Namibia moves to genuine independence within the shortest time possible.First  from the moment the League of Nations gave South Africa the Mandate to administer the then South West Africa  the racist regime took to flouting the terms of that Mandate. Under the Mandate South Africa was  in particular  required to promote the political  economic  social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the Trust Territory and their progressive development towards self-government or independence; to encourage respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion; and to ensure equal treatment in social  economic and commercial matters. What happened over the years in that Territory  however  was a complete breach of the terms of the Mandate. Consequently the United Nations in 1966 abrogated it.Secondly  even after the International Court of Justice and the Security Council further confirmed the illegality of South Africa's continued presence in Namibia  the racist regime defiantly refused to evacuate the Territory.Thirdly  efforts by the United Nations to persuade South Africa to allow the United Nations to assume its full responsibility over the Territory of Namibia and implement Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) have met with the obstinate and arrogant defiance of South Africa  and to date Namibia remains illegally occupied and its independence has been unduly delayed.Even friends and allies of South Africa must now agree with us that South Africa has no intention whatsoever to relinquish its control over Namibia peacefully. It is now imperative for this Organization use coercive measures  as provided for in the Charter  to force South Africa to evacuate the Territory of Namibia and thus enable the Organization to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The Secretary-General reported that the provisions of the resolution had been agreed upon by the parties directly concerned aid that all the outstanding issues relevant to the resolution had been resolved by November 1985. Hence  we reject any attempts to delay Namibia's independence any longer on account of irrelevant and extraneous issues such as the attempts to link the independence of that Territory to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. In addition  it is intolerable that the racist regime has continued to engage itself in creating futile institutions in the Territory with which it hopes to circumvent the terms of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).The world has for a long time been treated to a series of deceitful maneuvers and tactics all designed to delay indefinitely the genuine independence of Namibia or replace it with a puppet administration subservient to and controlled by the racist regime in South Africa. These evasive moves by South Africa to delay Namibia's independence further must be brought to an end. In this regard  my delegation fully accepts ana supports the recommendations of the Paris World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa and the International Conference for the Immediate Independence of Namibia  which culminated in the holding of the recently concluded fourteenth special session of the General Assembly  on the question of Namibia. We joined in the call by that special session to the Security Council to convene immediately and take a firm decision with respect to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which remains the only internationally accepted basis foe the independence of Namibia. We now expect the Security Council to adopt an enabling resolution to trigger off the implementation of the united Nations plan for Namibia's independence.On the Middle East  we have consistently supported the just and legitimate demands of the Palestinian people for a homeland and a State of their own. He consider the right to self-determination which the Palestinians have for so long been denied to be the core of the problem in the Middle Cast. We should recall that the exercise of the right to self-determination constitutes one of the basic principles of the United Nations We  in this regard  are obliged to continue to support the just demand? of the people of Palestine and to reject totally the Israeli practice of acquiring and occupying territories by threat or use of force. We in Kenya firmly hold the view that no nation should ever attempt to justify its own existence at the expense of others. Thus  we insist that all States in the region have an equal right to coexist in peace and security and within internationally recognized and secure borders.Elsewhere in that area  Kenya is gravely concerned about the prolonged and destructive war between Iran and Iraq. The war represents a negation of one of the cardinal principles of the Charter of our Organization - that is  the peaceful settlement of disputes. We hope that wiser counsel will soon prevail. We believe that the United Nations has a vital role to play in this and we reiterate our appeal to the parties concerned to bring this fratricidal war to an end.In Lebanon  a civil war continues to inflict untold sufferings. It is our hope that all the parties concerned will do everything possible to facilitate the restoration of peace in that tormented country. In this connection  we must express our strong opposition to foreign intervention or interference in the internal affairs of sovereign  independent States. We believe that parties to anydispute should seriously endeavor to resolve the dispute peacefully in a spirit of good-neighborliness and respecting each other's sovereignty; independence and territorial integrity. We hold this position firmly as it also relates to the situation in Afghanistan  to Kampuchea and Cyprus and to the unstable situation in Central America.Kenya is convinced that disarmament is a moral imperative in this nuclear age if the basic purpose of the United Nations Charter - that is  the maintenance of international peace and security - is to be achieved. It is self-evident by now that the continued accumulation of sophisticated  lethal weapons  particularly nuclear weapons  does not provide additional security. On the contrary  the arms race has further jeopardized international peace and even brought mankind close to the precipice of self-destruction. The situation clearly demands dialog and meaningful negotiations  an£ it is in that context that we have expressed our appreciation at the ongoing bilateral negotiations between the super-Powers in Geneva and elsewhere. It is our earnest hope that their negotiations will have a favorable impact on the global disarmament efforts and on the lessening of world tension. Indeed  we take note that the United States end the Soviet Union have now embraced the idea of reductions of offensive weapon systems.We  on our part  reject the notion that increased armament superiority between the two super-Powers is a means to achieve peace. Today  nuclear-weapon States and other militarily significant States spend colossal financial resources annually on the manufacture  improvement and acquisition of arms.This indeed is a deliberate waste of the world's resources  which should be redirected to the improvement of the well being of mankind  particularly the poor and underprivileged. At a time when the world is reeling under severe economic strains  when the level of poverty in developing countries staggers the imagination  the two leading super-Powers fail to heed the passionate pleas of the world community for a halt to the arms race.The current economic situation continues to reflect persistent structural imbalances between the countries of the North and the South. These imbalances have been compounded by growing protectionism  deterioration of the terms of trade  mounting external debt  inability in the international monetary system  and the emerging reverse transfer of net resources from the developing to the developed countries. Against this background the gap between the developed and the developing countries continues to widen  posing a threat to international peace and security. The crisis is not merely a cyclical phenomenon but a symptom of the deep-rooted structural imbalances that afflict the world economic system.In that regard the existing economic system requires thorough reform  including the restructuring of the international monetary  financial and trading systems for the mutual benefit of the developed and the developing countries.International trade is going through one of the most disturbing periods in history. Current trends of protectionism and threats of unilateral restrictive actions comparable to those which plunged the world into the depression of the 1930s are increasingly being erected in most developed countries to the point where protectionism seems to be the order of the day. While tariff barriers are the most obvious of all protective measures  non-tariff barriers have  under many euphemisms  become more and more insidious and widespread. The international community has a duty to ensure the smooth working of the international trading system and to correct inherent disparities. In working out modalities for free trade  the necessary measures should he taken to accelerate development and to ensure the distribution of accruing benefits to all the peoples of the world. In this regard Kenya looks forward to the new round of multilateral trade negotiations as well as to the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII)  both of which will provide an opportunity for the search for solutions to the problems hindering the growth and expansion of world trade. For our part  we shall make every effort to contribute to the success of the new round of multilateral trade talks and of UNCTAD VII by approaching the negotiations in a spirit of compromise. We believe such an attitude is necessary for the realization of the objectives of those important conferences relating to trade and development.Kenya continues to emphasize the urgent need to recognize the interrelationship of problems in the areas of trade  development  finance and monetary systems  including the indebtedness of developing countries. It was most appropriate that at its second regular session  held in Geneva this year  the Economic and Social Council focused its attention on the interrelated issues of money  finance  resource flows  debt  trade  raw materials and development. My delegation shares the view that a political dialog should be established between the Governments of creditor developed countries  international financial and banking institutions and developing countries in order to reach a global and equitable arrangement on relieving the debt burdens of developing countries. For the same reason  due to the prevailing uncertainties in the international monetary system my delegation reiterates its support for the convening of an international conference on money and finance. Such a conference would address itself to many of the critical issues which up to now continue to be on the agenda of various international forums disjointedly in spite of their interrelationship.For the first time in the history of our Organization  early this year the Assembly convened a special session devoted to the development crisis afflicting the African continent. The special session focused comprehensively on Africa's Priority Program for Economic Recovery and Development. At the conclusion of its deliberations at the special session  the General Assembly  inter alia  adopted and endorsed by consensus the United Nations Program of Action for Africa's Economic Recovery and Development  1986-1990. This constitutes an important step that demonstrates the political will of the international community as a whole to tackle Africa's economic problems with renewed determination. However  the implementation phase of the Program of Action is most crucial for the achievement of its noble objectives. Kenya and other African nations are keenly monitoring assistance from the developed countries and others in a position to help in that regard. The period 1986 to 1990 is a short one  and we therefore appeal for the expeditious adoption of practical measures towards mobilizing the resources necessary for the successful implementation of the Program.African countries have individually and collectively embarked on a concerted comprehensive Program to deal with the development crisis. As can be seen from the records of the twenty-second summit session of the Organization of African Unity Heads of State or Government recently held in Addis Ababa  from 20 to 31 July  we have committed ourselves to a series of bold and radical measures to save the African economies from collapse and to ensure fundamental restructuring and policy reorientation that will launch the continent on the path to self-sustained development. I wish in this connection to put on record my Government's appreciation of all the efforts and determination of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  during his tenure of office  in search of solutions to the African development crisis.Economic co-operation and technical co-operation among the developing countries  commonly referred to as ECDC/TCDC activities  should be viewed as being complementary to North-South co-operation. Economic co-operation among developing countries should not in any way be seen as the application of an isolationist policy but rather as a means of widening the scope of international co-operation with the objective of accelerating economic growth and increasing the productivity of developing countries. In this context Kenya has endeavored to work closely with other countries of Eastern  Central and Southern Africa in the economic and technological fields. Together with the sister countries of our subregion  we have worked out co-operative arrangements which are important instruments for enhancing economic and technical co-operation among our countries. These arrangements include the Preferential Trade Area  encompassing 15 countries of East and southern Africa  the recently established six-member State Djibouti-based Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development and the Northern Corridor Transit Traffic Agreement.In another area the world today faces another serious problem  one almost as serious as the threat posed by nuclear weapons. I refer to the problems of drug abuse and the associated illicit trafficking. In recognition of the seriousness of the social problems posed to certain populations of the world community by drug abuse and the illicit trafficking of drugs  this Assembly adopted resolution 40/122 and agreed to convene an International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking at the ministerial level in Vienna in 1987. The problem of drugs and drug trafficking is not only social but has deep economic and political ramifications. We look forward to the outcome of the Vienna Conference  which will definitely give us all an opportunity to discuss this subject in detail and to map out concrete solutions.I am convinced that in the activities o£ our Organization in the recent past we have not in any way been short of declarations  programs or strategies. He have  for example  adopted very impressive documents like the 1985 Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies adopted by the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the united Nations Decade for Women  and the Vienna International Plan of Action on Aging  and we have marked the International Year of Disabled Persons  1987. All have had a serious bearing on social development and its relationship to economic development. As we proceed individually and collectively in implementing these Programs and strategies  every effort should be made to increase their momentum.In the area of population  we continue to applaud the good work being done by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities. In spite of the progress made  developing countries are still confronted with problems such as urbanization  internal migration  high mortality rates and environmental degradation. Moreover national and international economic problems have jeopardized measures taken to redress adverse population trends. Kenya considers population control to be an essential component of development. Solving crucial population-related problems requires both national attention and international co-operation. In this connection we welcome the decisions of the recently concluded Barcelona International Conference on Population and the Urban Future. Rapid population growth and a sudden upsurge in urbanization are among the most dramatic trends in Africa's demographic picture. This situation is expected to persist and will certainly increase the demand for employment  housing  health  education and related services. Closely related to the population problem is the International Year of Shelter Year for Homeless  which will be observed next year. Kenya is committed to the objectives and strategy of the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless and we have already instituted the necessary administrative procedures in preparation for the observance of the Year  which will coincide with the tenth session of the Commission on Human Settlements.The forty-first session of the Assembly coincides with the observance of the International Year of Peace  as proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 40/3 of 24 October 1985. There is no doubt that the International Year of Peace is a landmark in the effort to which we are all committed and provides a unique opportunity for us all to reaffirm our support for and dedication to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.It cannot be overemphasized that peace is a universal ideal. The maintenance and promotion of peace constitutes a primary purpose of our Organization. In observance of the Year we in Kenya have set aside a full month  from 16 September to 16 October of this year  during which we are dedicating a few minutes each day to contemplation on the importance for mankind of peace in the world.I conclude by extending good wishes to all the nations assembled here today as we move ahead in pursuit of world peace  security and co-operation in all our endeavors."
"76",3758,"KHM",41,1986," Mr. President  I have the great honor to begin this address by paying a well-deserved tribute tothe statesman who is entrusted with the onerous task of conducting our works duringthe present session  and who has been elected to his office by a unanimous vote of this Assembly.We are aware of your wisdom  experience and impartiality. An eminent son of Bangladesh  you come from a country which plays a very positive role through its loyalty to the United Nations Charter and its eagerness to further regional co-operation  of which Dhaka is one of the centers  and international co-operation as well. It is also a pleasure for me to recall that your great country and my own have always maintained relations of trust and friendship.May I also be permitted to pay a tribute to your eminent predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  who conducted the work of the fortieth session with great wisdom and skill.I believe I express the feelings of everyone of us when I address my very cordial and affectionate salutations to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose exemplary dedication to his noble task  determination and courage cannot but increase our gratitude and admiration. He has spared no effort and omitted no initiative to ease world tension  seeking always  within the framework of the high mandate conferred on him by our Organization  to find a just and equitable solution to the many problems that beset us.Even if  from time to time  he has been tempted to give way to discouragement  he has persevered in embarking on the course he has chosen  faithful to the motto that was formerly that of the Head of State of a small  noble country: ""It is not necessary to hope in order to undertake  or to be successful in order to persevere.""For many years I have come to this rostrum  to brief the Assembly on the painful problems of my country  Cambodia. It is a small country with a small population  with no resources other than agriculture  a considerable part of whose people have had to choose exile in order to preserve their customs  their freedom and sometimes their lives.Cambodia - Kampuchea in the Khmer language - was great and powerful at the time of an empire which at its height created monuments that still fill mankind with admiration. In the eighteenth century our Annamite - alias Vietnamese -neighbors  resorting to force or trickery  seized our rich eastern provinces  known as Lower Cambodia  and  with the help of the then colonial Power  made them Cochin China  known today as South Viet Nam.Aware of our relative weakness and wishing to put an end to the disputes between us and Viet Nam  we had the wisdom to declare that we were satisfied with the borders resulting from French colonization  provided they were secure and recognized. Our sole  legitimate ambition was to live in peace and security among ourselves  devoting our energies fully to the economic development of our country and the well-being of our compatriots.A peaceful and hard-working country: such was Cambodia before 1970.Knowing that North and South Viet Nam. had a population 10 times that of Cambodia  and that its array ranked fourth in the world  I had done my best to carry out towards it a policy of understanding  conciliation and friendship. Although we were officially neutral  I had granted facilities to the Vietnamese guerrillas fighting the Saigon regime and permitted them to station themselves in some uninhabited border areas and to receive weapons and supplies via our ports and borders.In exchange for this aid  which I deemed valuable  I had obtained what counted most to me. In 1967  the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam - that is  North Viet Nam - solemnly recognized and guaranteed the independence and sovereignty of Cambodia  ""within her present borders""  according to our own formulation.We Khmers accordingly thought that from  then on we were secure.Unfortunately  after having signed a treaty  which was in fact a military pact with the Soviet Union  reunified Viet Nam  on Christmas Day 1978  launched its powerful infantry  tanks and aircraft against Kampuchea  whose considerably less numerous troops were overwhelmed  despite their heroic resistance. Hanoi's design was not  despite its claims  to ""come to the rescue of the brother Khmer people out of humanitarian concern""  but quite simply to realize the scheme for the Indochina Federation  a scheme which was masterminded as early as the 1930s on the founding of the Indochinese Communist Party.Whatever they may say today  the Vietnamese have never given up this plan for the Indochina Federation with Hanoi as its capital.Thus  a country which had made such tremendous efforts and sacrifices to free itself from foreign domination and consequently won general esteem suddenly proved to be an expansionist  colonialist Power  shamelessly repudiating its most solemn commitments to a small neighboring country  with contempt for the letter and the spirit of the United Nations Charter and flouting the wise resolutions adopted by our Organization to put an end to the war in Cambodia.Thus  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam revealed itself to be a nation that does not keep its word and is without honor. It lost at a stroke the sympathy of its friends  and was left with only the Soviet Union as protector and financial backer  that country having strategic and political interests in Viet Nam. Indeed  it is the various components of the Khmer resistance  making up the coalition of Democratic Kampuchea  that gain year by year wider support from the international community.For the eight years that we have been occupied  we have tirelessly conducted joint military and diplomatic initiatives.This year  the military situation in Cambodia has changed. The heaviest fightings no longer take place at the border with Thailand  but far deeper in the interior of the country. Despite the construction by Cambodians through a system of forced labor under Vietnamese orders of a heavily mined trench along the Khmer side of the border - similar to the mined belt built by the apartheid regime of Pretoria along the borders of Namibia - our resistance units have succeeded in carrying out vigorous action around the Tonle Sap - the Great Lake - in the fertile  densely populated plains in the immediate vicinity of Phnom Penh and even near the Vietnamese border.Our forces have destroyed many Vietnamese administrative centers set up in villages and communes throughout the country and have frequently attacked district and provincial capitals such as of Siemreap  Kompong Thom  Battambang  Pursat andKompong Speu  as far as Pochentong international airport  at the gates of Phnom Penh. These daring raids  which are mounted by an ever growing number of men  take the enemy by surprise every time  and cause them heavy losses in men and military equipment.The increasing number and effectiveness of these raids are possible only thanks to the active participation of the people  who provide us with information and serve as our guides  and the co-operation of Kiwier soldiers forced by the Vietnamese aggressors to enlist in the Heng Samrin puppet army  who give brotherly support to our fighters. The feeling of revolt already noticeable among the villagers has been spreading to the Heng Samrin troops  who have on many occasions mutinied against their Vietnamese commanders  eliminated them  taken to the country and whenever possible joined the national resistance. Such feats of arms have been spreading throughout the country all the more quickly since our guerrillas are now almost everywhere  in particular near our villages  to protect the people.The Vietnamese occupation forces in Cambodia are now in an impasse. They know from their own experience that a national resistance which enjoys the people's support cannot be defeated.Along with the patriotic armed struggle  we have also sought to offer our adversaries the possibility of reaching a negotiated solution satisfactory to both parties. Should they accept  we would wish to establish an agreement with the Vietnamese that would benefit our two countries and peoples and would enable them  once peace has been restored  to establish ties of friendship and co-operation based on the ""five principles"" of peaceful coexistence  in equality  mutual respect and reciprocal interests.The Assembly has witnessed this appeal for good understanding and peace  which I renew every year from this rostrum on behalf of my country and its coalition government and on my own behalf.Every year  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has chosen  out of conceit  to ignore our peace proposals and those of our South-East Asian neighbors and friends  as well as the fair resolutions on Kampuchea adopted by the United Nations. Acting against the will of the entire international community  Viet Nam pretends to recognize as the only legitimate Government of Cambodia the puppet team it set up following the occupation of our capital  which  needless to say  would not have been able to remain in power a single day were it not for the permanent protection of the Vietnamese armed forces.We should like  however  to spare the blood of our compatriots and to put an end to the sufferings of those who live in exposed and sometimes bombarded camps on the border.While Viet Nam unremittingly pursues the war in the stubborn hope of achieving a military solution  which every year grows more faint  the puppet regime of. the so-called people's Kampuchea is disintegrating further every day under the irresistible thrust of the patriotic people as a whole and of their national resistance forces. The international media have given thorough accounts of thesteadily worsening situation in our country and in Viet Nam itself. I should like to quote some revealing excerpts from those press reports.In The New York Tines of 23 December 1985  Ms. Barbara Crossette reported the following: There is impartial evidence from residents of Phnom Penh that (the guerrillas) are regularly within striking distance of the city. In September  they fired rockets into the capital's central fuel storage depot  a resident of the city said.""The resident said the explosions had shaken buildings across a wide area. Only the failure of several of the rockets to fire saved the whole depot from destruction  he added."" (continued in French)The daily newspaper The Nation Review of 16 January 1986 pointed out: (spoke in English)""In a rare military briefing for Western journalists. General Trang Cong Man  editor-in-chief of Viet Nam's army newspaper ... admitted that during the current dry season  (the guerrillas) 'harassed the suburbs of the Kampuchean capital of Phnom Penh  the important north-western provincial capital of Siemreap and other areas. Such incidents were rare prior to 1984  and large areas of the country previously accessible to foreigners are now off limits for security reasons...."" (continued in French)Agence France Presse (AFP) reported on 26 March 1986:Cambodia's pro-Vietnamese authorities are using Buddhist monasteries and temples for propaganda meetings to promote their army in a recruitmentdrive.....That campaign  also the subject of a circular from the CambodianCommunist Party's Central Committee  was launched as the Phnom Penh army was apparently encountering discipline problems.""According to the AFP report  the circular requested that local authorities organize meetings intended""to disseminate information on the armed forces' role and the entire population's defense duties"". AFP stressed that""This appeal indirectly confirmed statements from Thailand and the anti-Vietnamese Cambodian resistance that desertions had recently taken place in the Phnom Penh army .... Phnom Penh's military publication. Revolutionary Army  in February shed a little light on problems of discipline and numbers  criticizing a number of unspecified units and commanders for a lack of enthusiasm and ideological weakness. A well informed source on military affairs in Hanoi recently said that the Phnom Penh troops lacked experience."" The New York Times of 5 April 1986 wrote: ""A year after the Vietnamese overran guerrilla camps along the Thai-Cambodian border  (the Khmer resistance forces) are increasing their activity in almost every Cambodian province  according to guerrilla leaders and diplomats.""Reports reach Thailand of guerrilla strikes  some close to Phnom Penh. Several diplomats suggest that the Vietnamese ... (are) secure in garrisons  but did not control the countryside ....""An unusual confirmation of the seriousness of the situation inside Cambodia has come from the Soviet newspaper Pravda. A report from the Cambodian press agency (of the Phnom Penh regime) said that Soviet economic aid will be doubled over the next five years. According to Soviet figures  aid last year totaled 138.6 million dollars. Disruption caused by the guerrilla war is adding to the already severe economic problems of Cambodia  it was reported in Pravda  which added that in the countryside  the Cambodian Communist Party was attracting few members despite programs of ideological education ...."" (continued in French)The magazine The Economist of 19 April 1986 wrote: ""The Government of Heng Samrin  with the help of the Vietnamese soldiers who have been sitting in his country since 1978  is still trying to get a grip on Kampuchea. The grip keeps slipping .... In the winter of 1984-85  the Vietnamese wiped out a string of guerrilla camps along Kampuchea's border with Thailand .... The guerrillas are back in business. Brigadier-General Tran Cong Man  the editor-of-chief of Vietnam's army newspaper  reckons there are now 8 000 - 12 000 of them in Kampuchea. A communist diplomat in the capital  Phnom Penh  puts the figure at 15 000 .... The guerrillas have become harder to catch ....""In a report published in he Monde of 4-5 May 1986  Jean-Claude Pomonti wrote as follows:It is noted that security measures have been strengthened in Cambodia since the summer of 1985. In August of that year  military service  which is compulsory for men from 18 to 30 years of age  was extended from two years to five years. Around the villages in some provinces fences have been strengthened and a night curfew is being enforced.-Since that time  police authorization is requited for movement between districts. New identity cards have also been distributed. Since January 1986  patrols in Phom Penh have been reinforced and each group of 10 families must provide two men to serve as night guards. Similar measures have been taken in at least some provincial cities ... Heng Samrin  chief of the Phonm Penh rigime  has admitted that resistance activities have posed complicated problems' for his administration. In a Cambodian Communist Party circular  read out on 3 April over Radio Phnom Penh  he even specified that the new maneuvers of the enemy forces have temporarily caused complicated problems here and there  in this or that department'.""Rene Backmann  writing in the weekly  Le Nouvel Observateur  of the last weekin August 1986  reported the following:""Pour years ago  in April 1982  I was allowed to go across the whole country  from Takeo near the Vietnamese border up to Sisophon at the Thai border. Bridges  railway stations and villages were strictly controlled by Vietnamese and Cambodian soldiers  but traffic was free and heavy. At present  journalists are allowed to go only up to Kompong Speu  about 50 kilometers from the capital  and those wishing to go to Siemreap and Angkor must take an Air Kampuchea Antonov 24 aircraft  flown by a Soviet crew. The roads are no longer safe. ""Lack of security  resulting mainly from the activities (of the resistance forces] starts at the gates of Phnom Penh ... It is clear that they"" - the national resistance forces - ""are able to strike almost everywhere outside the towns. They mine roads  fire rocket-launchers at trucks and trains ... 'It is true that the military situation is not good ' admitted a Vietnamese official  who received me in the cool living room of a villa somewhere in Phnom Penh and who refused to be identified. 'The situation is net easy for us here. We have made a number of blunders  and we shall make them again  certainly. And you will not be convinced if I tell you that we are loved by everybody* ...""The health of the population is poor. Pulmonary diseases  malaria  parasitosis and malnutrition wreak havoc. 'Infant mortality remains very high  in particular because of tuberculosis ' noted Dr. Sau Sokhonn  director of the 7 January Hospital. At ts e National center for Sanitation and Epidemiology ... Dr. Khun Ngeth spofte to me at great length about the theoretical role of his department and finally confessed that out of 1.35 million children aged under five only 63 000 had been vaccinated against tuberculosis. And yet vaccines have been provided by UNICEF. ...""The drawers of my room at the Monorom Botel are always lined with old issues of Pravda. Five or six cinemas have reopened their doors; they screen Soviet or Vietnamese films in auditoriums that are three quarters empty.""Soviet 'experts'  always in groups  in their gray Volgas or minibuses  are now less circumspect than they were four years ago. ... The Vietnamese colony seems to be growing. In addition to 'advisers' in white short-sleeved shirts and soldiers in olive green uniforms a.. we now come across housewives in traditional black trousers  bright tunics and cone-shaped hats shopping in the towns ...""Black market pharmacists from O Russei markets  who sold medicines stolen from State stocks - provided by OdlCEF - or clandestinely imported  have become quasi-official pharmacists  selling on the black market all the medicines that are missing from the hospitals. ... Health Ministry personnel divert medicines provided by UNICEF. ... Doctors with a monthly salary of 300 riels desert their hospital posts to give consultations in their apartments.""The war continues  and it costs dear  in men and money. Soviet and Vietnamese experts are paid in dollars ...""The decision to call up men aged 16 to 30 for three years' military service  then to round up for three months tens of thousands of civilians to clear areas close to roads and lay mine fields along the Thai border  has been very unpopular  especially when the 'volunteers' have come back to Phnom Penh bringing with them a particularly resistant form of malaria which has claimed a heavy toll. Soldiers with limbs amputated  victims of mine explosions  begging for rice at the doors of restaurants are a constant reminder to the population that the war is at the gates of the capital.""Today the future seems to be blocked and the diplomatic 'quarantine' which has already lasted for seven years  is becoming more and more intolerable to the [puppet] leaders of Kampuchea. Shut off from the outside world ... the country struggles on in a state of impenetrable torpor  filled with sadness  resignation and dreams. At the airport  the customs officer who checked my luggage before my departure saw that I had with me letters for Cambodians who had emigrated to France. He frowned  then smiled and asked me whether I could take his letters too ...""The occupation of Kampuchea - and of Laos - has drained Viet Nam's scanty human and material resources  so that its internal difficulties are now glaringly obvious.In an article published on 5 Hay 1986 in the daily newspaper Nhan Dan  and in the Communist Review  the theoretical organ of Viet Nam's Communist Party  Mr. Le Due Tho  number two and ""strong man"" of the Communist Party of Viet Nam  wrote as follows:""Many among the cadres and Party members  realizing the economic difficulties and the difficult living conditions of the people  are concerned about how we are going to extricate ourselves from this difficult situation  and in general about our country's future ... Such things as corruption  smuggling  self-enrichment  dissolute and depraved behavior  over-indulgence in food and wine and bare-faced bribery are widespread among cadres and Party members ... everywhere and at every level. This causes a great waste of production  loss to the people and degeneration among cadres and Party members  and has reduced the confidence of the masses. Never before in our Party has there been such a lowering of the standards of virtue and in the way of life ...""The international prestige won by Viet Nam through the blood shed by its people in a just struggle waged over several decades has now melted away in the furnace of its anachronistic colonialist policy.Viet Nam is facing ever growing difficulties  and we have tried once again to make the leaders in Hanoi understand that it is clearly in their interest to negotiate with their adversaries  namely the legitimate representatives of the people of Kampuchea.It was with that a in in mind that the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  on 17 March last  put forward to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam an eight-point proposal for a political settlement of the problem of Kampuchea  a proposal which is in line with the relevant resolutions of the united Nations and with the Declaration adopted at the International Conference on Kampuchea  held in July 1981. I wish to recall briefly those eight points. They are:First  negotiation between the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nan for the total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea within a definite time frame. We accept a two-phased withdrawal of Vietnamese forces.Second  after the agreement on the withdrawal there will be a cease-fire.Third  both the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the cease-fire will be supervised by a United Nations observer group.Fourth  after the first phase of Vietnamese troop withdrawal  Heng Samrin and his faction will take part in a coalition government of Kampuchea which will then become Quadripartite  with each of the four parties having the same rights as political forces in the national community.Fifth  the quadripartite coalition government of Kampuchea will hold free elections under the supervision of the United Nations.Sixth  Kampuchea will become an independent country  united within in its ownterritorial integrity  having a liberal democratic regime  peaceful  neutral andnon-aligned without any foreign base. Its neutrality will be guaranteed by the United Nations.Seventh  Kampuchea welcomes all countries from West and East  neutral and non-aligned  to help rebuild the country.Eighth  Kampuchea is willing to sign with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam a treaty of non-aggression and peaceful coexistence  and to establish economic and trade relations with it.This proposal has been given broad support by the international community  in particular China  the member States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Japan  the United States of America  Canada  Australia  the EuropeanEconomic Community (EEC)  and the overwhelming majority of non-aligned and third world countries. However  it has been rejected outright by Viet Nam and  with some embarrassment  by the Soviet Onion and its allies.Yet  this is an equitable and lasting solution to the problem of Kampuchea  testifying to the utmost flexibility and open-randiness of our Government. Should Viet Nam reconsider its hasty and absurd refusal  this proposal would allow not only the restoration of peace to our country but also the end of the political  economic and diplomatic isolation - almost insoluble so far - in which Viet Nam has been driven.As soon as Viet Nam agrees to withdraw its troops from Cambodia  Khmer national reconciliation will come true. For the present war is not a civil war; it is the result of the Vietnamese invasion. I have already said that the Heng Samrin army has been co-operating fraternally with the Resistance army in the field. As for the military and civilian officials of the so-called people's Republic of Kampuchea  they are Khmers like us. Should they wish to see 3 their homeland with us  we will offer them not only immunity from reprisals for having worked under the occupiers' orders but  furthermore  the assurance that they will share with us the same rights as free citizens and possibly administrative and even State responsibilities.Our people have suffered too much from those long years of war and misery to deprive themselves of the co-operation of any of their sons  provided it is a loyal one.We have learn from tragic experiences of the past that the national unity of the Khmers is a vital necessity. The one and only way to our survival is therefore national reconciliation within an appropriate social  economic and political framework  that is  in a liberal parliamentary regime which will bring us peace  independence  territorial integrity  non-alignment  as well as a neutrality guaranteed by the United Nations  and a sincere co-operation with all countries based on peaceful coexistence.As far as Viet Nam is concerned  it would have its proteges take part in a quadripartite government entrusted with organizing free and United Nations-supervised elections  and enjoy the same rights as other Khmer citizens. Our neutrality would assure Hanoi that no foreign base can be installed on Khmer soil  and that no foreign Power can claim any dominant influence over our country.Moreover  as soon as a Khmer Government is formed after the general elections  independent Cambodia will propose to Viet Nam the signing of a treaty of non-aggression and peaceful coexistence  and the establishment of friendly and peaceful mutual relations - a treaty which will be opened to all western  eastern and third world countries.Thus  Cambodia and Viet Nam would consequently be able to live and prosper side by side  without hatred or a spirit of revenge.I would add that  for the whole of South-East Asia and the Pacific  reconciliation between Cambodia and Viet Nam would remove all threats to peace  security and stability in the region. We knot/ how much our friends in ASEAN wish to turn South-East Asia into a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  known as ZOPFAN - a wish that remains unfulfilled because of the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea. The adoption of our eight-point peace proposal would pave the way to the establishment of such a zone  which would be beneficial to all countries in the region - including  of course  Viet Nam.The international community represented in this Assembly is perfectly aware of all these prospects. It has therefore granted us broad and firm support. On behalf of our people and Government and on my own behalf  I express my heartfelt gratitudefor this support.Legally  the rejection of our proposal by the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is inexplicable. So is it in actual fact  since our opponent claims that he wants to ""negotiate"" in order to put an end to the conflict and that he desires nothing but a ""negotiated solution"".The Hanoi Government up to now has had a strange way of considering this solution. It first claims that the regime it has installed in Phnom Penh is ""the sole legal and legitimate representative of Kampuchea""  that it has ""the entire country under its control""  and that it ""enjoys the support of the whole Khmer people"". It claims that Viet Nam further intends to pursue a ""constructive dialog"" with the ASEAN countries to resolve ""the problem of peace  stability and co-operation"" in South-East Asia. With regard to Kampuchea  it finally asserts that it is up to the different factions of our country to ""negotiate with oneanother"".I should like to state once again that the ongoing conflict in Cambodia is not a civil war  but a war of aggression waged against an independent and sovereign State Member of the United Nations. In addressing ourselves to Viet Nam and proposing a particularly generous peace plan to it  we address ourselves to the only party responsible for this conflict  to the one on which peace or war depends.Representatives in this Assembly Hall are quite well aware that the Phnom Penh regime cannot be considered the ""legal and legitimate Government of Kampuchea"" Installed immediately after the fall of our capital city and composed of elements trained ideologically in Hanoi or owing allegiance to it  this regime controls nothing  not even itself  for it is placed under permanent control of Vietnamese cadres at every military and civilian level. As for the Khmer troops forcibly enlisted by the occupiers  I repeat: they cause us no harm  since they are openly opposed to their Vietnamese masters and help the Resistance forces whenever possible.In trying - vainly - to dodge the real problem of Kampuchea  Viet Nam hopes to make people forget the presence of its armed forces in our country and to maintain them there for ever  in its talks with the ASEAN countries the Hanoi Government does what it can to make them rubber-stamp the fait accompli and to negotiate with them as if there were no occupation of Cambodia.Now  if our ASEAN friends sincerely wish to resume correct relations with Viet Nam  they are too realistic and aware of their interests to accept this situation which is of legitimate concern to them. They say that if they allow a small country like Cambodia to be ""swallowed up"" by the Vietnamese  then each of their nations will be exposed to the expansionist threat of a warmongering and over-armed Power  with a population of 60 million and determined not to aMde by its commitments and treaties.Furthermore  no one in the world believes the Vietnamese propaganda regarding partial and gradual withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea  knowing that the so-called withdrawal is simply rotation to replace exhausted  ill or wounded soldiers by fresh troops  which are actually reinforcements.As for the renewed solemn proclamation by Hanoi that it would withdraw all its armed forces from Kampuchea by 1990  provided - it has said - those withdrawals -are not taken advantage of to undermine the security and peace of Kampuchea""  we have already made it clear that that is nothing more than a purely rhetorical formula  namely  the oax vietnamica in Kampuchea with the permanent presence of Vietnamese forces. That was confirmed by Ms. Barbara Crossette in The New York Times of 5 January 1986. ""... Hanoi has said it hopes to withdraw its troops by 1990. Today  however  when asked if there was any hope of settling the military situation in Cambodia sooner than that. General Man was not optimistic. 'The fighting must continue for some time'  he said. 'It is not possible to stop soon.' The General said that the Khmer resistance forces had been using more artillery in attacks against the Vietnamese ....""In the face of the irresistible development of our patriotic resistance  the Vietnamese Ambassador to Phnom Penh  Ngo Dien  really acting as a proconsul  declared to the special correspondent of The Economist in Phnom Penh in that magazine's issue of 19 April 1986: ""We may have to return if Kampuchea is menaced in the future.""The Vietnamese are already talking of coming back to Kampuchea though they have never left.As can be seen  so long as Viet Nam refuses to end its war of invasion and occupation in Kampuchea  the Khmer people and their coalition government have no alternative but to pursue the struggle for the nation's survival. They are encouraged by the ever firmer and broader support of the international community. If it were otherwise  there would indeed no longer be a ""problem of Kampuchea"" but in a few generations - perhaps in several decades - Cambodia would have vanished from the map of the world. Overwhelmed by the growing influx of Vietnamese settlers - more than 700 000 at the present time - its people would have become a minority on their own soil. Not only are virtually all the traders  fishermen  stock-breeders and planters Vietnamese but an increasing number of Vietnamese farmers are occupying our richest lands  leaving to the Khmers peasants only unproductive land.We do not expect miracles from this International Year of Peace but only that it may offer an opportunity for the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to think about the consequences of its ambition  which has already brought about so much bloodshed  misfortune and suffering to our people as well as to its own people. It is certain that an equitable settlement of the Khmer—Vietnamese dispute would set a valuable example for all countries the world over which are having difficulties with their neighbors and wish to settle them without recourse to arms. I am sure that an appreciable step would thus be made towards good understanding and reconciliation between nations.Today  unfortunately  the international situation is marked by growing tensions  with local and regional conflicts worsening  terrorism escalating  andcrises heavily affecting developing countries. Hundreds of millions of people in various regions of the world are facing misery and famine while rich  producing countries do not know what to do with their agricultural surpluses. Everybody speaks of peace  disarmament and development while the arras race continues unabated  in a climate of generalized suspicion.It is not with words that we shall build peace and improve the human condition  which remains the sacred aspiration of all peoples  but rather through strict respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries through the peaceful settlement of disputes and the implementation of the sacrosanct principles of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. Those principles are clearly set forth in the Charter of the United Nations  which we have solemnly pledged to abide by and implement.Let us take a look around the world.Despite the patriotic efforts of African Governments  Africa is still facing serious difficulties  aggravated by the world economic crisis. There is abject poverty almost everywhere and the survival of millions of Africans in several countries is at stake. At its thirteenth special session the General Assembly adopted by consensus an important program aimed at stepping up co-operation and increasing aid and support to the African Governments which are in trouble despite their courage  to help them in their efforts to bring about the structural transformation of their countries with a view to achieving quick  self-sufficient and autonomous development. The adoption of this program shows that it is possible to mobilize States from all continents  despite their political differences  to join in a common effort to fight against natural disasters  misery and famine. That is indeed a bold initiative  one that goes far beyond direct aid  in particular in terms of food  to which the aid of developed countries to the most underprivileged has for too long been limited.The people and Government of Kampuchea have always had cordial and fraternal relations with the African peoples and nations which have valiantly struggled as we have for independence  freedom and national identity. Today the Government of Democratic Kampuchea continues - and will continue still more in the future - to the best of its limited means to make a contribution to Africa's victory over misery and famine and to its success on the way to development and progress.The real trouble spot on that continent is still southern Africa  where the Pretoria regime continues to oppress the large majority black population  to occupy Namibia illegally  to deny the Namibian people their right to self-determination and to pursue activities of aggression and destabilization against neighboring States.We are convinced that the only remedy for the abhorrent regime of apartheid is its eradication. We are of the opinion that global economic sanctions against the Pretoria regime would hasten the establishment of a multiracial  egalitarian and democratic society. The elimination of the apartheid regime would further contribute to the peaceful  just and lasting solution of the problem of the decolonization of Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978)  as called for recently by the General Assembly at its fourteenth special session  on the question of Namibia. So long as the policy of apartheid continues to be carried out and so long as Namibia continues to be occupied  its neighboring States will continue to be the victims of acts of aggression  subversion and destabilization on the part of the Pretoria regime. The Declaration of the World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa of 20 June 1986 expresses the sense of revulsion of the international community in the face of the arrogant challenge of the Pretoria regime to world condemnation of apartheid. Our heartfelt and unwavering support goes to the valiant South African people  victims of the worst violence  and to their real leaders  most of whom are undergoing hardship in prison  to the Naraibian people and their leaders in the South west Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  and to all the peoples and Governments of the front-line States.In Chad  the situation remains serious and can be solved only through the withdrawal of all foreign forces of occupation from the national territory. We renew our fraternal support for the just struggle of the Chadian people and Government to realize national union and the territorial unity of their motherland.In the Middle East  the parties concerned are still far from sitting at the same negotiating table. We deplore the denial of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people  without which the region will be nothing more than a powder keg  and we continue firmly to support the Palestine Liberation Organization  the legitimate representative of the Arabs of Palestine.In Lebanon  the fate of the nation is in the hands of its sons and daughters. It -is our earnest hope that that country  once called the Switzerland of the Middle East  will succeed in overcoming its differences and hatreds and that the Lebanese people can find national concord. Needless to say  we want all foreign hostages to be liberated.Despite the repeated calls of the international community for peace  the Iran-Iraq conflict today remains the bloodiest in the wold. The human and material losses are high  and the conflict threatens to spill over to neighboring States. We urge neighboring and fraternal States to follow the path of peaceful  just and honorable settlement of the conflict in the interests of their peoples and to the satisfaction of all their friends the world over.In Central America  the Contadora Group  backed by the Support Group  has ceaselessly stepped up initiatives aimed at finding a political and peaceful solution to the problems of the region. The Presidents of the five Central American countries on 25 May last voiced their will to pursue the search for peace and democracy within the framework of the Contadora Group. We wish them every success in their noble undertaking despite the serious difficulties still blocking their way.In Asia  our continent  the situation in Korea has remained explosive for almost 35 years. The division of the country continues. Reunification of the fatherland retrains the unanimous and sacred wish of all Koreans. In order to achieve that jOal it is necessary to continue to build  through meetings and talks in every field between the delegations of both parties  mutual confidence and understanding that will lead to a meeting between the parliamentary delegations of toe National Assemblies of the Hero era tic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea in accordance with the wise  realistic and patriotic proposals formulated by President Kim II Sung. It is our hope that those meetings and talks  which in 1985 resulted in encouraging results  will resume without hindrance and expand for the good of the s?.e Korean nation and people within a sustained process aimed at the peace""?:""  and independent reunification of the Korean fatherland.In Afghanistan  a heroic people has for seven years been waging fierce and indomitable resistance against the Soviet invaders and the regime in their service  which is itself torn by internal rifts.Hiding behind orchestrated propaganda supposedly favoring disarmament  peace and international security  the Soviet Union ruthlessly bombards the civilian population without any distinction  razes villages to the ground  tortures and executes opponents of the regime that has been imposed by Moscow. Nearly 4 million citizens of the unfortunate com try of Afghanistan have been compelled to take refuge in Iran and Pakistan.Yet it is obvious that despite the increase in Soviet forces having at their disposal a great number of tanks  aircraft and helicopters as well as seasoned troops  and despite the discrepancy in forces and weapons  the successes scored by the Afghan resistance on the ground should make the Soviets understand that  whatever price they may pay  their victims will never let themselves be subjugated. The Soviet Onion should arrive at the wise conclusion that it is not by repeatedly changing its puppets in Kabul that it will succeed in persuading the international community to accept the fait accompli in that country.An indispensable and lasting peace can be restored only on the basis of the just United Nations resolutions which call  just as in the case of our Cambodia  for the withdrawal of all foreign forces frost Afghan is tan and exercise by the African people of its inalienable right to self-determination.As long as the Soviet Union delays the restoration of that peace  the Mujahideens will have no choice but to continue their patriotic struggle against the occupiers. And the Islamic Republic of Pakistan  whose very noble and generous compassion towards the Afghan people should be emphasized  also has no choice but to defend its threatened sovereignty and repeatedly violated territorial integrity. The Khmer people and its Coalition Government will continue their total support for end solidarity with that just struggle.As for our neighbor to the north  our Lao brothers and sisters are waging a difficult but very courageous struggle against Viet Nam  which has absorbed their motherland through the so-called treaty of friendship and co-operation signed in July 1977. In our struggle against a common enemy and for the same cause  wecontinue to grant them our unwavering support and fraternal solidarity.May I be permitted to express my warmest thanks for the Assembly's attention throughout my statement.The General Assembly of the United Nations is the only place in the world where all countries  from the biggest to the smallest  from the most powerful to the weakest  can freely speak of their problems in the certainty of being listened to  and sometimes heard. That is why we Khmers  overwhelmed with difficulties andhaving only the comfort of our conscience and your understanding  feel so much at home here.I should like to thank you for this noble understanding as well as for your compassion towards a people that in this hour of misfortune counts on you for its survival."
"77",3871,"KWT",41,1986,"I have the honor. Sir  to extend to you on behalf of Kuwait  its Emir  its Government and its people our heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-firs' session of the General Assembly. You come from Bangladesh  a friendly Muslim country with which Kuwait has the strongest bonds. We are confident that your great skill and long experience will effectively assist us in making the work ofB this session successful. I also wish to commend the skill and expertise with which Mr. de Pinies performed his task ^s President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly and his praiseworthy efforts in directing the affairs of that historic session.I take pleasure  too  in expressing to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar our full appreciation of his endeavors  good offices and diplomacy in handling the various complex world issues and of his command of the administrative situation in our Organization  as reflected in his valuable report to the current session. We welcome his presence today  following his recuperation  and we wish him good health for the future.The General Assembly resumed its fortieth session five months ago to discuss the most serious financial crisis experienced by the United Nations since its inception. Unfortunately  that crisis  which still casts a dark shadow over the activities and future of our world Organization  has taken on political dimensions that are already complicating and impeding multilateralism.Kuwait views with great concern the crisis which the United Nations is facing. We believe that in order to deal with it fairly and prudently we must all refrain from exploiting the Organization for political purposes - as are certain countries with their own ideas of what the effective role of the United Nations should be. Instead  efforts should be focused on the definitive fulfillment by all countries of their political and financial obligations in accordance with the Charter. We hope that the crisis is merely a passing cloud that will not affect the principle of collective action and that the role of our world Organization will regain the status envisaged for it under the Charter  in the interest of international peace and security and of the survival and continued progress of mankind.We must try with all the vigor at our command to transform that crisis into momentum for administrative reform  rationalization of expenditure and the creation of an exemplary world structure within which constant efforts are made for the well-being of all humanity. After all  the viability of the United Nations and the preservation of its role are in the interest of all mankind and all nations  regardless of narrow political concerns. It is reassuring and auspicious that the Organization has lately been witnessing the gradual abandonment by critical Members of their intransigence and a renewed recognition on their part of the Organization's significance for world stability and the importance of collective action in the sphere of international relations.In this regard  we wish to place on record our appreciation of the efforts of the Group of High-Lev el Intergovernmental Experts in reviewing the efficiency of the administrative and financial performance of the United Nations. We hope that the General Assembly will seriously consider and study the Group's recommendations in the interest of multilateralism.In recognition of the importance of collective international action  whether in the framework of the United Nations or that of other international or regional forums  Kuwait will host next January the summit conference of the Islamic countries  which is convened every three years. We wish to stress that our work when we we 1 cone the leaders of Muslim countries to Kuwaiti soil will constitute an important brick in the edifice of collective international action and a contribution to the consolidation of world peace and security and the solution of complex global problems.With this lofty aim of serving world peace and the peoples of the region  we look forward to the forthcoming summit conference of the leaders of the Arab Gulf Co-operation Council  which will be convened  God willing  in the United Arab Emirates in November. We are confident that what is achieved there will give an impetus to the drive towards well-being and peace initiated by States members of the Council at their first summit meeting.Kuwait is deeply concerned about the continuing intensity of disputes  tensions and the arms race  as well as the exacerbation of international political conflicts and economic problems and their repercussions  which lead to the escalation and extension of disputes and divisions in various regions of the world. We are also increasingly concerned that the phenomena of terrorism  particularly State-sponsored terrorism  have become so widespread as to endanger the security of peoples and States alike.The most serious threat to the ability of the international community today is that attention is being distracted from the vital issues of man's survival  development and prosperity by regional and international conflicts  in which precious resources are wasted  innocent blood is shed aid lives are lost and which engender ill will and animosity that threaten mankind's future.A case in point is the Iran-Iraq conflict  which has now entered its seventh year. That tragic conflict causes heavy loss of life and saps the resources of two States Mentors of the Organization. It also constitutes a threat to the security and stability of the countries of the region and freedom of navigation in the Arab Gulf region as a result of the seizure and bombing of ships and tankers that belong to countries not parties to the conflict. Kuwait's commercial fleet has been affected over the past three years by the numerous unjustified attacks  the latest of which was directed against the Hl-Puntas tanker on Tuesday  16 September 1986. In conformity with Security Council resolution 555 (1984)  we have given the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council a detailed account of that incident. While referring to the above-mentioned Security Council resolution  which is considered to constitute a framework which the parties to the conflict must observe  Kuwait believes that the Security Council has a special responsibility under the Charter to maintain peace and security in the world in general  and to influence the hotbeds of conflict in particular  and to ensure that the flames do not spread to other States that are not parties to the conflicts.We  the small States  look up to the Security Council and expect it to shoulder its responsibilities under the Charter and put an end to this conflict.The persistence of this tragic conflict has afforded outside Powers the opportunity to seek to exploit and perpetuate it for in it they found a chance to weaken the Muslim ranks  throw them into disarray  upset the balance of relations in the Arab world  and undermine the unity and solidarity of the developing nations  which are bound by the fundamental issues of a common destiny. Being an Arab Gulf country and a member of the Co-operation Council of Arab Gulf Countries  we believe that the international efforts at mediation  in which our world Organization is supposed to play a decisive role  must continue relentlessly and unceasingly until peace and stability have been restored to the region. In co-operation with its sister member countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council  Kuwait has sought  and still continues to seek  to end this devastating dispute. The international community must also close ranks and work as a whole to bring this conflict to a final and immediate end. We have now come to a crossroads  and should this danger be allowed to persist  the consequences will doubtlessly affect everyone and will extend beyond the regional scope  with the result that no one would stay unscathed from its evil effects.While blessing every well-intentioned endeavor and every constructive proposal  by whomsoever it is put forward  to end this conflict  Kuwait declares its support for the latest initiative taken by the Government of Iraq because it includes important principles on the validity of which the world community has agreed and which would ensure the achievement of a just and lasting solution to the conflict between the two neighboring countries  a solution that would preserve the legitimate rights of both parties in accordance with international conventions and laws. Kuwait also calls on the Islamic Republic of Iran to respond favorably to this new initiative and to all genuine efforts directed towards putting an end to the bloodshed  saving the resources of the two Muslim peoples and ensuring a safe and honorable life for them.We must refer in this regard to what the non-aligned countries called for at their eighth summit conference at Harare this month in regard to the Iraq-Iran conflict  both in the commendable statement of the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe  Mr. Robert Mugabe  at the opening session  or in the final declaration issued by the conference.We believe the resources and wealth of Iran and Iraq are being wasted on the wrong front. The right place for those capabilities is the front where the battle is being fought for the region's future against the common foe  whose four-decade occupation of Palestinian lands has unmasked its true aggressive and expansionist intentions towards all countries of the region.The Zionist entity  which was created on the basis of false historical premises and by virtue of absolute support from well-known Western quarters  is the entity that was based en the policy of aggression and expansion at the expense of Arab countries  the entity that continues to occupy Palestinian and Arab territories  the entity whose activities of State-terror ism have branched out to various areas inside and outside our region.Israel does not declare publicly its rejection of peace: rather it would have peace on no other basis than the recognition of the fait accompli  namely its seizure and control of the Arab-occupied territories  those of the West Bank  the Gaza Strip  the Syrian Golan Heights and South Lebanon. Not content with this it blatantly interferes and undermines the security and stability of Lebanon through a series of brutal raids and barbaric military operations. Clearly  had it not been for this continued aggression and blatant intervention  Lebanon would not have remained in the morass of its crisis and internal turmoil.Israel is required to submit to the will of the international community which calls for the withdrawal of its troops from South Lebanon. These troops have persistently maintained their illegitimate presence since 1978  either directly or by proxy. The members of the Security Council have the undoubted duty of making a concerted and determined effort towards achieving this withdrawal. We concur with the Secretary-General's recent call for them to take immediate action  individually and collectively  to implement Security Council resolution 425 (1978).W>at we have affirmed in the past  and what we continue to affirm  is that peace  as we Arabs perceive it  does not mean Israel's mere pledge not to expand its fait accompli policy  namely not to occupy and annex more Arab territories  but rather  in essence and inevitably  the restoration of the lands that were usurped and the re-establishment of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  especially their right to self-determination  in order to enable them to create their independent State on their own soil under the leadership of their sole legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PIO).In spite of Israel's barefaced persistence in committing acts of systematic State-terrorism  namely murder  detention without trial  plunder of lands  Judaization  colonization and other well known Zionist actions  we still hear some Western voices making cries for help on behalf of the party their propaganda portrays as the tame Israeli lamb  while hurling accusations of terrorism and barbarism at those who have inalienable rights and become targets of aggression when they defend themselves against that aggression and try to repulse the weapon of tyranny and brutality away from their women  children and the elderly.Israel has been  and continues to be* the first to ignore and bring disgrace upon the Charter of the United Nations and the will and the resolutions of the international community  including the resolution on the convening of an international conference on peace in the Middle East  which represents a focal point for any movement towards a peaceful settlement. Should the aggression-oriented and peace-rejecting entity persist in this course and continue to make futile attempts to impose the fait accompli policy  under the spell of the illusions of separate and partial solutions  the consequences will dangerously exacerbate the situation with regard to security  regionally and internationally.t)This forty-first session is convened at a time when this year  1986  has witnessed an intensified escalation both on the level of the national struggle waged by the oppressed majority in South Africa and by the Namibian people  and that of the heroic resistance by the front-line States in southern Africa as well as in the international support and sympathy accorded to that legitimate struggle and honourable resistance. In 1986 two international conferences have been convened under the auspices of the United Nations cn Namibia and sanctions against South Africa  followed by a special session of the General Assembly on Namibia  which was concluded only a week ago  not to mention various other meetings conducted within the multilateral context and devoted to the just causes of southern Africa.We have also seen the leaders of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  a movement which represents the majority of the members of our international community  meeting at the beginning of this month in Harare under the chairmanship of one of the leaders of the struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination. That successful summit meeting was conclusive evidence of the ultimate and firm solidarity of the broad majority of the international community with the peoples of southern Africa.There is no need for us to draw the attention of the world community  whose representatives are gathered here today  to the crimes the racist Pretoria regime is perpetrating against the indigenous majority in South Africa  its continued occupation of Namibia and evasion of the implementation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  and its unjustified acts of aggression and the blackmail policies it pursues against the front-line States. However  we wish to assert anew from this rostrum that the arrogance and insistence on eschewing the logic of justice  right and peace exhibited by the racist Pretoria regime and its supporters is tantamount to the pursuing of a misleading mirage  from which nothing will be reaped but defeat and loss and which will lead nowhere but to the acceleration of the downfall of such artificial entities that are a legacy of the colonial past. The independence-loving and freedom-loving peoples of the world will not rest until apartheid and racial discrimination a re eliminated and majority rule instituted in South Africa  and until colonialism in the territory of Namibia is uprooted and its people have regained their national legitimate rights under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  their sole legitimate representative.The problem of Afghanistan lingers on despite the lapse of seven years since the foreign military intervention began in the territories of that peaceful Islamic nation. In spite of all the continuous international efforts and resolutions that advocate allowing the Afghan people to choose their own polity and determine their own future without foreign interference  Afghanistan continues to suffer under the burden of the illegitimate foreign military presence. Kuwait urges the international community and its organizations to continue their endeavors towards settling the Afghan problem and solving it peacefully through the withdrawal of the foreign forces from the Afghan territories  non-intervention in the country's internal affairs  respect for its sovereignty and repatriation of Afghan refugees. We hope that the progress towards settling the problem we have noticed during this year will lead to the achievement of those goals.Our position with regard to foreign intervention also applies to the Kampuchean question. We are firmly convince J that both covert and overt forms of intervention pose a grave threat to international peace and security and to the peoples of the regions afflicted by them.The Latin American States and the region of Central America have not been immune from painful regional disputes. That region is still turbulent and tense as a result of the extension of the great Powers' sphere of rivalry there  and innocent lives nave thus become hostages of an ideological and political conflict extraneous to the region and incompatible with all its interests. The major Powers must respect the national choices of the people of the region and refrain from interfering in their domestic affairs  while all parties concerned must abide by the norms of international legality and the noble principles of the United Nations Charter. Kuwait supports all peaceful efforts aimed at settling the region's problems  primarily those of the Ccntadora Group and its Support Group.For some time new a perilous phenomenon has been becoming more and more noteworthy in the arena of international relations  namely  terror ism in its various forms. This phenomenon has begun to undermine the stability and security of peoples and States and to expose innocent lives to devastation  outrage  terror and dismay. It erodes the fabric of international relations and destroys bridges of coexistence among countries and peoples. The phenomenon has  regrettably  taken on many forms and has become a bane to which nobody is immune.While vehemently and firmly condemning this dangerous phenomenon  Kuwait believes that countering it is a collective international responsibility that must be shouldered with full determination and loyalty. The historic resolution on terrorism adopted by the General Assembly at its fortieth session should rally international action against this phenomenon. In our view  that resolution is a beginning for steps that must be expeditiously taken to eliminate the evils of this bane and its tragic human consequences.While adopting this basic position towards terrorism  Kuwait emphasizes once again the necessity for distinguishing and drawing no parallels between terrorism and the sacred right to legitimate struggle of national liberation movements  especially those in Palestine  Namibia and South Africa.If we cast a general look at the world economic situation we find that the aspects of disequilibrium and inequality in international economic relations have intensified and that growth rates in most developing nations are either at a standstill or declining. We find that the limited economic recovery experienced by some industrial countries was of no benefit to developing nations and soon began to fissile out again  since it was based on the narrow interests of the major industrial countries  their economic parochialism and their growing tendency towards unilateral action  away from the framework of collective action and the mechanisms of joint international activity.We find that instead of providing for a flow of financial resources from industrial to developing countries to support the latter in their difficult development efforts  and instead of seeking to stimulate exports between the two regions of the world  the policies of some Western com tries have produced a reverse flow of capital  a negative trend that strengthens the dynamism of disintegration in regard to exchange rates  the imbalance of monetary systems and the rising of interest rates in the industrial nations  which serves to exacerbate the world debt crisis and has proved to be a heavy burden for developing countries.The world economic situation has deteriorated to a degree that is reflected particularly in the economic crisis of the African continent  which we are called upon to deal with diligently and' in detail through the implementation of the United Nations plan for reviving and developing the African economy adopted by the special General Assembly session earlier this year. The gravity of the world economic situation is also reflected in the severity of the debt crisis in many of the developing countries  and it is therefore imperative  in the light of these alarming conditions  to seek to establish without delay a comprehensive economic system that depends on the palpable reality of the international economic situation.The requirements of development are among the paramount priorities of the developing countries  and the call to end the global arms race undoubtedly constitutes a crucial element in this regard  for the link between development and disarmament is one of the axioms of today's world.In conclusion  I wish to appeal on behalf of Kuwait to all Members of our international community to renew their pledge and commitment to the lofty principles and goals of our Organization  and to devote genuine and self-denying efforts to the achievement of advancement for the international community and for mankind. Let us work together to ensure the success of this session  so that it can provide a new brick in the edifice of constructive international action in the interests and future of our peoples."
"78",3917,"LAO",41,1986," I should like to begin by warmly congratulating Mr. Choudhury on his well-deserved election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. My delegation considers this to be a tribute to his country and to him personally. His wisdom and diplomatic qualities assure us that our work will be crowned with success.My delegation also wishes to express its satisfaction at the outstanding way in which his predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  discharged his heavy responsibilities during the previous session.We wish to pay a tribute to the patience and devotion with which our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  has worked to create conditions favorable to the strengthening of international peace and security and the promotion of international co-operation for development.As we meet today once again in this prestigious Hall we cannot help but cast a backward glance at the achievements of the fortieth session  which was  as we all know  a commemorative session  and at those of the present year  which has been proclaimed the International Year of Peace. While there has been a trend towards a reduction of tension in certain parts of the world  the international community has witnessed a resurgence of acts of aggression  overt or covert intervention and other forms and practices of State terrorism carried out by the warmongering imperalists and their staunch allies against certain independent  sovereign States in Asia  Africa and Latin America.The hopes of the people of the world that were raised last November by the Soviet-American summit meeting have come to naught. That meeting did not provide the expected momentum towards a reduction of tension in international relations or a slowing down of the arms race  particularly with respect to nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt that survival in the nuclear age is the most crucial  pressing problem for all mankind.The Lao People's Democratic Republic welcomes and firmly supports the new initiatives and constructive and realistic proposals put forward by the Soviet Union for the gradual and total elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2000. Furthermore  the Soviet Union  despite the negative attitude and opposition of the United States Administration  has extended its unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests three times. It is vitally necessary for the other side to reciprocate. Equally commendable was the proposal recently made by the countries members of the Warsaw Pact substantially to reduce armed forces and conventional weapons in Europe. Regarding the prevention of the militarization of outer space  the Soviet Government also recently put forward a comprehensive program for the exploration and international exploitation of outer space for peaceful purposes for the well-being of all mankind.In order to free our planet Earth from the threat of a nuclear holocaust that would destroy all forms of life and human civilization itself  it is the most sacred duty of the peoples of the world to step up their stubborn struggle against the unbridled nuclear and conventional arms race here on Earth and the extension of the arms race to outer space. Accordingly/ the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic welcomes and firmly supports the Declarations of New Delhi and Mexico by six Heads of State or Government  as well as the activities to promote peace and disarmament carried out by mass organizations throughout the world. In this connection  it is very much to be hoped that the Soviet-American negotiations in Geneva on limiting nuclear and space weapons will have concrete results and that the Geneva Conference on Disarmament will make substantive progress in the negotiations on the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and on a convention completely prohibiting chemical weapons.We hope that the American side will show greater realism and abandon once and for all its plans to achieve some hypothetical military superiority by persuading its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies and others to join in its so-called star Wars program and seeking unilaterally to revoke the SALT-II agreements of 1979. In this connection  we should note that the Heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries  at their eighth summit meeting in September in Harare  appealed urgently for an end to the unbridled nuclear arms race and all projects designed to extend the arms race to outer space. My delegation warmly welcomes the initiatives of the Socialist countries concerning the establishment of a general system of international peace and security encompassing the political  economic  military and humanitarian fields  an item which has been included in the agenda of the current session.Tension and bloody conflicts  with their toll of death and suffering  have become almost the daily lot of the world today. Their causes are well known to all.In the Middle East  the Zionist occupation forces continue with impunity to repress and oppress the defenseless populations of the Palestinian and Arab territories which have been occupied since 1967.Southern Lebanon and its population continue to suffer from the exactions of and the atrocities committed by the Zionist troops  which refuse to withdraw from the area  in flagrant violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions of 1978 and 1982. Israel's arrogant and intransigent attitude can be explained by the fact that it receives comprehensive support from its ""strategic ally"" and those in other imperialist circles.The Lao People's Democratic Republic reaffirms once again its consistent stand with respect to the settlement of the Middle East problem  at the heart of which lies the Palestinian question. The Lao Government will firmly support anycomprehensive  just and lasting settlement that ensures the exercise by thePalestinian people of its inalienable national rights  including its right tocreate its own State in Palestine  and the complete and unconditional withdrawal ofIsraeli troops from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967 including Jerusalem. We firmly hope that  in order to achieve that goal  theInternational Conference on Peace in the Middle East can be held as soon aspossible  under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of theSoviet Union and the United States  as well as all the parties concerned  includingthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole  legitimate representative ofthe Palestinian people. It is unfortunate that so far the United States Governmentand Tel Aviv have categorically rejected the convening of that Conference.The world was deeply outraged by the acts of provocation and armed aggression committed last March and April by the United States Administration against Libya  an independent and sovereign country  a Member of the United Nations and of the Movement Non-Aligned Countries. Those acts have been universally condemned. The Lao Government and people wish to reaffirm their steadfast support for and solidarity with the Libyan people and other Arab peoples in the region who have thus become the victims of acts of provocation  intimidation and aggression at the hands of Zionist forces and their absolute protector.We cannot  of course  allow ourselves to be unmoved by the grief and destruction which the Iran-Irao conflict has inflicted upon the peoples of those two countries  members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and of the United Nations. We sincerely hope that a just  lasting and mutually acceptable solution can be found to that tragic conflict  which has gone on far too long.A regime of unspeakable terror and oppression continues to hold sway in South Africa as a result of apartheid  a most savage and inhuman system of racial discrimination which the white minority in power there has institutionalized as a principle of government. The Lao Government and people have always been associated with the noble efforts of the international community to do away with this anachronistic endemic scourge once and for all. It was that same racist Pretoria regime that was responsible a century ago for the misfortunes of the Namibian people  whose territory it continues to occupy illegally. The position of my Government in this respect is well known. We consider that the accession of the Namibian people to true independence in a united Namibia can be achieved only through strict and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). It is essential that the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its special session devoted to that question  which ended successfully barely 10 days ago  should now be scrupulously implemented.Having themselves experienced colonial oppression in the past  the Lao Government and people wish to reaffirm their support for  and solidarity with  the heroic people of south Africa under the leadership of the African National Congress on the one hand and the valiant Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  its sole and legitimate representative  on the other. The same support also goes to the peoples and Governments of Zimbabwe  Angola  Mozambique  Zambia and the other front-line States that are struggling in the same noble cause as well as in the defense of their independence and sovereignty and of the territorial integrity of their respective countries.The threats to peace and security in Central America have recently increased by a disturbing degree. In this connection the International Court of Justice recently declared illegal the acts of armed provocation and economic and commercial blockade which the United States Administration has committed against the heroic Government and people of Nicaragua. A just  lasting and mutually acceptable settlement to the crisis in Central America can  we feel  be achieved only through implementation of the peace initiatives drawn up within the framework of the Contadora Group and the Lima Support Group.The Government and people of the Lao People's Democratic Republic wish to reaffirm here their support for and unswerving solidarity with the people of Nicaragua and the Sandinist government in their struggle to preserve their independence and sovereignty and the territorial integrity of their country.We also reaffirm our sympathy with arid firmest support for the Government and people of Cuba  our brothers  who are still waging a tireless struggle to preserve their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. Our sympathy and solidarity go also to the people of Puerto Rico and the other peoples in that region who are struggling heroically for self-determination  independence and true democracy in their respective lands.The region of South-West Asia has unfortunately not remained free of tension. I refer in particular to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  which has been the victim of an undeclared war waged by the aggressive circles of imperialism and regional and world reaction. The Lao Government and people energetically condemn this whole series of acts of state terrorism and reaffirm their unswerving support for and solidarity with the Government and people of Afghanistan in their tireless efforts to preserve the precious gains of the April Revolution and to find a just political solution to the situation with respect to that country.In the region of the Indian Ocean  the intensification of the military presence of imperialism and the strengthening of the air and naval bases at Diego Garcia constitute a grave threat to the peace and security of the coastal and hinterland States. It is essential  therefore  that the International Conference on the Indian Ocean be convened without further delay in order to turn the region into a zone of peace.The situation in Asia and the Pacific region as a whole  and more specifically on the Korean peninsula  is scarcely stable. The introduction by the United States of nuclear weapons into South Korea  not to mention the division of the peninsula and attempts to perpetuate the existence of two Koreas  constitute a grave threat to peace and security in the region and an obstacle to the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation.With respect to the strategic interests in the Pacific area  my delegation is firmly opposed to the resumption of nuclear tests and attempts to deploy imperialist nuclear weapons. These represent grave threats to the security of the peoples in that region.With respect to the fate of the peoples in colonial territories and those under trusteeship  my country is opposed to any procedural manoeuvres by the colonial and administering Powers to bring about the annexation of Micronesia and New Caledonia. We support the courageous struggle being waged by those peoples to achieve true independence for their territories.I should like now to refer to the problems of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia  a region which includes my own country  the Lao People's Democratic Republic. The underlying causes of the instability and tension in the region are all too familiar for the simple reason that they have been referred to from this rostrum by a large number of delegations  including my own  over the last seven years.In leading circles of imperialism  expansionism and great-Power hegemonism a dim view is taken of the success of the revolutionary process in the Lao People's Democratic Republic  the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. They wish to reinstate in Pnom Penh the criminal gang of Pol Potists and their lackeys  against the sovereign wish of the suffering Kampuchean people.The international community has a duty to protect the legitimate interests and inalienable fundamental rights of the Kampuchean people  whose endeavors to bring about the renaissance and miraculous national consolidation of the country deserve respect and admiration.Success achieved over the past eight years by our three peoples - Lao  Vietnamese and Kampuchean - in the work of national defense and reconstruction and of strengthening solidarity and co-operation with socialist and other countries of the world committed to peace and justice constitutes a fundamental factor guaranteeing the peace and stability of the region. The three countries of Indo-China have already on several occasions reaffirmed their intentions  most specifically in the communique issued by the thirteenth conference of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Laos  Viet Nam and Kampuchea  held in Hanoi from 17 to 18 August last. On the one hand  it referred to the adoption of the measures necessary to make South-East Asia a zone of peace  friendship and co-operation  on the basis of the total withdrawal of foreign troops from the area and the cessation of all foreign interference. On the other hand  it proposed a solution to the Kampuchean problem. In this connection  it should be recalled that the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea is ready to negotiate with Khmer opposition groups or individuals on the basis of the military and political elimination of the Pol Pot clique  together with the withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteer forces from Kampuchea  in order to bring about national reconciliation.We welcome the significant statement made last June in Manila by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the establishment of an international tribunal to try Pol Pot and other criminals responsible for the crime of genocide in Kampuchea. That realistic and honest proposal must evoke a favorable response from all members of the world public committed to peace and justice.The relations between the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Thailand are not free from difficulties. A large number of problems have arisen between our two nations during recent years and have not yet been appropriately resolved. However  the constant demands of the Lao and Thai peoples for normal relations are becoming increasingly pressing. That is why the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic believes that it is time to talk and is prepared to do everything in its power  at both the governmental and the local level  to create conditions favorable to the strengthening of mutual understanding and trust between our two peoples  in order to bring about a resumption of negotiations and the speedy normalization of all areas of Lao-Thai relations  and to contribute to ensuring peace and stability in the area. Similar action by the Thai Government will always be welcomed.Relations between my country and the People's Republic of China have not improved. However  the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic attaches great importance to its long-standing friendship with the Chinese people and accordingly calls for normal relations and good-neighborliness on the basis of respect by the People's Republic of China for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  non-aggression and non-interference in our internal affairs and peaceful coexistence.Consequently  we hope that instead of persistently espousing an erroneous approach to the problems of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia and to the problem of Kampuchea  the international community  particularly the United Nations  may make a constructive contribution to promoting the irresistible process of dialog which has already begun  however cautiously  among the countries of Asia directly concerned.It is interesting to recall that the Heads of State or Government of non-aligned countries  at their 1983 summit Conference in New Delhi and the Harare summit last September  spoke out clearly on this matter. In this connection  it seems to us that the item entitled ""The question of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia"" has been on the agenda long enough. That is why  to spare this session of the General Assembly an atmosphere of tension  acrimony and useless polemics  it would be preferable not to discuss this item but to focus rather  on the underlying problem relating to the overall situation in Asia and the Pacific.I should now like to say something about the close relationship betweendisarmament and development. People of good faith accept without reservation the*fact that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between these two realities. Only those who refuse to put an end to both the conventional and the nuclear arms race challenge the existence of such an organic link.There can be no doubt that if only a tiny fraction of the astronomical sums devoted annually to military expenditure throughout the world could be freed it would suffice to relief the suffering and poverty of a sizable number of children  women and old people in Africa  Asia and Latin America  or even the world as a whole.In this connection  my delegation has learned with disappointment and regret that it was the negative  uncompromising attitude of certain Western Powers that prevented the convening this year in Paris of the United Nations Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development.Similarly  my delegation is concerned at the financial crisis of the United Nations  which in our view results from the premeditated decision of certain imperialist Powers artificially to create that situation.The peoples of the world have an urgent and legitimate need to live in peace and security  free from conflicts and tension  frustration and poverty. Unfortunately  the peoples of the developing countries  particularly the least developed nations  are today suffering as a result of both acts of aggression and destabilization  and measures of economic  commercial and financial pressure imposed by imperialist and neo-colonialist Powers.More often than not it is the least developed and land-locked countries that suffer from the harmful effects of the hostile and reprehensible trade policy carried out against them by their neighbors  the transit countries. They continue to suffer from the harmful effects of the world economic crisis  compounded by the resurgence of protectionist measures resorted to by the great majority of the market-economy countries. The policy of high interest rates  the deterioration in the terms of trade  the crushing burden of external debt  the drying up of soft official development aid flows and  lastly  the reverse transfer of financial resources are all factors contributing fatally to the impoverishment of developing countries and particularly the least developed. Accordingly  it is not surprising that the gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" continues to grow. It is high time the developed market-economy countries reconsidered their unreasonable and selfish position and agreed to become actively and sincerely involved in the efforts of the international community to initiate global negotiations leading to the implementation of a strategy for restructuring international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. Let them not lose sight of the fact that the establishment of the new international economic order on a just and equitable basis  would work to the benefit of all the peoples of the world.In recent years there have been many disturbing events  which have resulted from imperialism's policy of interference  aggression  attacks and the plundering of natural resources. However  the peoples of the world  strengthened by their faith in the future and by the sustained efforts they are making in the quest for peace and social progress  have fought side by side to foil that policy. It is gratifying to note that this view of events was confirmed by the recent summit Conference of the non-aligned nations.My delegation hopes that this session  which has begun in an atmosphere marked by the optimism of the International Year of Peace  will prove to be capable of successfully carrying out the noble task en trusted to it by mankind."
"79",3961,"LBN",41,1986," I wish first of all to join other heads of delegations who have preceded me to this rostrum in conveying to His Excellency Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. I take this opportunity also to wish him every success throughout his term as President of the General Assembly. His wisdom  great experience and moderation are the best guarantee of success in this forum.I wish particularly to pay a tribute to the previous President of the General Assembly  His Excellency Mr. Jaime de Pinies  for his successful handling of the work of the Assembly at its fortieth session.I express ray country's gratitude to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the commendable efforts he has constantly made to achieve the purposes of our Organization - peace  security and well-being for all mankind - and to work towards more scrupulous compliance with and the implementation of its resolutions. We thank him too for the very special attention he has devoted to my country  Lebanon  which does him credit as a man of conscience.My country has always been unswervingly committed to the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations. Not for a single day  despite the crisis that has shaken it  has Lebanon failed to play its modest role as a Member of this Organization. We have an unshakable faith in the principles of the United Nations and view it as a supreme forum for saving mankind from the scourge of war - whether regional or world-wide - for improving the economic  social and cultural conditions in which people live  and for promoting the advent of a better world.We thus believe that it is the duty of all Member States to lavish on the Organization all the material and moral assistance it requires  and to Support the Secretary-General in his efforts. The United Nations must survive for the sake of the future of mankind. If it is true that we bear a collective responsibility  it is no less true that it is a priority on the part of the two super-Powers topromote concord among nations  to assure international peace and security and to end the crises and conflicts that are proliferating throughout the wot Id  These objectives necessarily involve adequate prevention  deterrence and repression of aggression  the granting of the right of self-determination to peoples  and the elimination of the injustices that threaten then  in the framework of greater respect for the dignity of the human person.The agenda of this session is certainly not short of important topics for deliberation. But we insist that Lebanon not be forgotten; in return  we undertake as far as possible to help solve the thorniest problems. Delaying decisions is no solution; it can only add to the existing complexity of the problem and lead to the proliferation of resolutions.Once again  the agonizing problem of Lebanon has come to the fore  as it has for 11 years without interruption  11 years of deliberations in the course of which all Members have become familiar with all aspects of the problem  11 years that make it unnecessary for me now to dwell in too much detail on what everyone now calls the ""hornets' nest"" of Lebanon. When it was a country standing tall  Lebanon never failed to respond in defense of a just cause. The walls of this Hall will remember this  and they still ring with the resounding appeals made from this rostrum. *Lebanon's tribulations began in 1975; our scarred people's wounds  still gaping  attest to its martyrdom  as spoken of by the heads of delegation who have mounted this rostrum year after year. What can I add that is not already known? I wish only to recall a few basic facts.Whether deliberately  out of ignorance  or trying coyly to hide their face  the media go on repeating that the war in Lebanon is a civil war.Today  I wish to aver as a man of conscience whose words will be confirmed by history  that the war ravaging the land of Lebanon is in no wise a civil war: not in its scope  not in its intensity  not in its very essence. In Lebanon  brother has not taken up sword against brother. Despite its pluralism  Lebanon is a mosaic held together by the cement of nationalism. Once the predatory vultures stop tearing it apart  the war will end forthwith  the unity that has been fragmented will be restored in our ravaged country  and brother will embrace brother.As I said  Lebanese society is a heterogeneous blend  but the Lebanese people - with all the groups that make it up - has deep roots in the land from which it draws its life-blood. Although it has been bowed by tribulation  nothing has been able  nor will it be able  to uproot that age-old cedar. First and foremost  Lebanon is a people  whose vital forces need security and quiet if their creative energy is to be released.Lebanon is the Lebanese  thirsting for peace and reconciliation in their homeland  a united homeland from which tears and suffering are banished. A people which death has daily haunted for 11 long years without being able to vanquish it totally  without ever extinguishing the life that runs with passion and determination in its veins  is a people with Rany branches  but none the less belonging to a single trunk  rooted in the same land.That is why I have just said that nothing could be further from the truth than talking of the events in Lebanon as a civil war  whatever the appearances my be. The problem of Lebanon is - to be quite objective - a tangled web of many skeins  of internal  regional and international factors. The war in Lebanon has three elements: first  internal dissension among the Lebanese comparable to that found quite naturally among numbers of the same family; secondly  the regional nature of a conflict which has been added to the Israeli-Arab dispute-  and  finally  the international dimension  because of the rivalry of the great Powers in the region  this it is true that the solution to each problem can be found by attacking the root causes of it  this is the equation that is found on taking up one by one the three component factors that I have juat mentioned.First  at the internal level  there is now a dialog going on between the various Lebanese parties concerned  on the initiative of the President of the Lebanese Republic  Sheikh Amin Gemayel  and this has been welcomed by the Head of Government  Mr. Rashid Karami  and the mentors of his Government. Let us hope that it will lead to a lasting agreement among the Lebanese that is not constantly threatened by disruption  an agreement enshrining a true osmosis  not simply coexistence""  concord  not merely a concordat; an agreement forging an authentic nation  not a pale reflection of one. That is why we are counting on this dialog to lead Lebanon bo calmer waters  pinning great hopes on the wisdom of its leaders and the heads of the various political factions. Internal witty is the bulwark against which the violent winds from outside have no effect.Lebanon will gain four main advantages from this unity. These are: the definitive ending of the war  to the great satisfaction of Lebanese and non-Lebanese alike; ^he establishment of the lasting security to which the Lebanese aspire and which is as necessary to them as bread  air aid light; amendment of the Lebanese Constitution and legislation to ensure greater justice and equality of opportunity for all Lebanese  and the fulfillment of the dreams and aspirations ofthe Lebanese within a more united Lebanon  with strengthened institutions - reforms made necessary by the attempts to divide us  which can only weaken our country and postpone its salvation; and national reconstruction and the restoration of everything that the war has destroyed throughout these long years of tragedy.Then all those of goodwill will unite in this common endeavor  the people of Lebanon will speak in a single voice in favor of a sovereign  free and independent Lebanon  not a piece of straw being tossed about by the waves  not the fragile prey of hungry vultures  but a strong Lebanon  strong because of the force of its people  its mother Earth  its history and its civilization.At the regional level  everyone is aware that in 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon  occupying part of its territory  in violation of the United Nations Charter and the most elementary rules and customs of international law. The Security Council adopted resolution 425 (1978)  in which it called upon Israel to withdraw forthwith from all Lebanese territory occupied by it  called for the restoration of international peace and security and for assistance to the Government of Lebanon in regaining control of all its territory in order to make southern Lebanon a zone of peace and security and established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  to be entrusted with a special mission.On 6 June 1982 the Security Council adopted resolution 509 (1982)  demanding that Israel withdraw unconditionally from Lebanon's internationally recognized borders. That did not prevent Israel from continuing to occupy a part of southern Lebanon  committing one act of aggression after another  with the assistance of armed forces trained and financed by it  and stopping UNIFIL from discharging the mission entrusted to it under resolution 425 (1978) and subsequent resolutions.Israel must withdraw from all occupied Lebanese territory. Until it does so  the continued presence of UFIFIL is indispensable. Lebanon wants UNIFIL to remainand asks that it be enabled without further delay to fulfill its mission more effectively. Although it is now eight and a half years since it was set up  it has  unfortunately  still proved powerless to ensure Israeli withdrawal  to prevent the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and to remove the aggressor from our territory.Lebanon deplores the incidents of which UNIFIL has been the victim since its establishment  whoever the perpetrators may have been  and particularly these that took place at the end of August and the beginning of September last.I reaffirm here that the people and Government of Lebanon are unanimous in their desire to improve the security of this Force. Lebanon is ready to contribute to all efforts in this connection. However  we call for a review by the Security Council of the role of UNIFIL. We share the concern of mentors of the Council from the troop-contributing countries and of the Secretary-General to ensure the security of the peace-keeping forces  which are the largest in the world.Lebanon is prepared to send UNIFIL a reinforcement contingent to help in the implementation of resolution 425 (1978)  which calls for Israeli withdrawal and the deployment of UNIFIL up to the international borders of Lebanon.I take this opportunity to say how horrified Lebanon is at the attacks against UNIFIL  and I wish to pay one last tribute to the memory of the officers and men who have lost their lives. The heartfelt condolences of Lebanon go to the Governments of the victims and their families  and in particular the Governments of France and Ireland. Lebanon thanks all the States that have given financial or logistic support to these troops  especially Sweden  which has increased its participation by providing UNIFIL with a logistic unit. Not content with pursuing its occupation of Lebanese lands  Israel  feels duty-bound to violate the integrity of Lebanese air and sea space. If Israel does not withdraw and its acts of aggression continue  the future of the region will be uncertain  for the people of Lebanon is resolved to free its land and to vanquish the occupier by practicing legitimate resistance  which can only increase in view of the inhuman acts of aggression Israel has persisted in imposing on Lebanon.We believe that liberating south Lebanon is a national duty and that resisting the occupier is a legitimate act under international law  whether written or customary. Every State that has ever experienced the bitterness of occupation has always resisted  adding to its history pages of fierce struggle  proudly written in the blood of its valiant resistance fighters. The General Assembly must know that the Lebanese leaders and heads of the popular factions have repeatedly stated that  once Israeli withdrawal has been achieved  Lebanon will never allow the pre-1982 situation to recur in the south.We categorically reject the policy authorizing that country to undermine Lebanese sovereignty and independence because of its perceived need to ensure its own security. The Lebanese are not the depository of the.security of Israel  nor are they responsible for policing its borders. They are responsible only for the adoption of security measures within Lebanese borders and do not accept any agreement that would impinge upon the sovereignty of their country.I can assure th^a Assembly that the implementation of resolution 425 (1978) -complete withdrawal of Israel and restoration of Lebanese sovereignty over the whole of Lebanese territory - is a basic element to the solution of the problem that gave rise to the war. I cannot fail to take this opportunity to appeal to the Arab nations. For some of them  Lebanon has become a focal point for their own problems and differences. Eleven years after the beginning of this deadly war their eyes have been opened to the fact that the tragedy being played out in ourcountry affects them too and that the conflagration which has engulfed Lebanon is now on their own doorstep. Yes  the Arab countries are indeed firmly resolved to root out this cancerous excrescence which has not spared them either. With their assistance we can rebuild our devastated country for the greater good of us all.I come now to the international dimension of the Lebanese conflict. The war of Lebanon  and we have made this point before  results from the inability to agree on a just  comprehensive  lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East and the obstinacy in linking Lebanon with the crisis that besets the region as a whole. We have constantly called for a solution to be found to this problem as soon as possible and we have given unambiguous support to the convening of an international conference on this subject with the participation of all parties concerned.Is it not therefore unfair that it is Lebanon  a small country so desirous of peace and tranquility that has been spared neither suffering nor tribulation  that is paying the cost of this inability to resolve these problems that go far beyond the context of its national borders?We appeal to our friends throughout the world - in particular the United States and the Soviet Union - to help us to put an end to our trials without linking our problem to the problem of the Middle East as a whole. Furthermore  I am convinced that the solution to the problem of Lebanon is one of the key elements to the settlement of the Middle East conflict.The crisis that has beset Lebanon for 11 years has brought in its wake an alarming political and social situation further compounded by the Israeli invasion of 1982 and the continued occupation of the south  as well as a distressing economic and financial situation that Lebanon alone is not able to put right. Our losses - in lives and material damage - are incalculable.In order to rebuild what the war has destroyed  we need the contributions of the Arab countries  friendly countries and international organizations  as well as the united Nations and its specialized agencies  in keeping with the resolutions of the Arab summit  the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly. He urge that Lebanon be helped to effect its economic recovery and to improve the lot of its sons in distress or displaced and to help tend their wounds.Frequently the mention of terrorism or certain terrorist acts brings with it the mention of Lebanon. Let me state from this rostrum that Lebanon knows the difference between resistance and terrorism. While resistance is legitimate when it is a question of restoring the rule of law on a territory freed from foreign occupation and within the context of regained sovereignty  the same cannot be said of terrorism  which we most vehemently reject and condemn.Everybody here knows that Lebanon is one of the victims of terrorism and that it has been suffering from terrorism more than any other country. How many innocent lives have been cut down  how many citizens have been forced into exile  how many orphans or invalids have been victims of this war!**The President returned to the Chair.Although  unfortunately  Lebanon has become for some a springboard to launch terrorist acts - because part of its territory is not under the control of the central Government - are we not entitled to think that if that Government were in a position to regain  inch by inch  control over its national territory and to restore public order there  that would in itself remove this scourge of modern times and the resulting shadow that looms over everyone  Lebanese and ncn-Lebanese alike? That is the task we are tackling  and it is here that the assistance of the international community is the most necessary  in order to enable Lebanon - through the implementation of this Organization's resolutions - to regain its security  territorial integrity and complete sovereignty  in its own interest and in the interest of everyone.After that brief review of the facts  I wish to make some comments.First  since its establishment  the United Nations - and I should like to say for the record that Lebanon was one of the founding Members - has had the responsibility of protecting the small States that do not have the resources to ensure their own defense  in a world where the law of the jungle is said to be the best law. And Lebanon  which is a small community  needs the confidence of others and looks to this Organization to fulfill the wishes of its people. That is why we hope that the United Nations will remain an effective Organization  monitoring compliance with the law and taking into consideration the aspirations of States to sovereignty and independence  with respect for humanitarian values. Only then will we be able to continue to view the Organization as the shield protecting us from injustice. Lebanon  as a Member of this Organization  certainly has obligations under the Charter; but it also has rights  which are the counterpart of those obligations and which it wants to see recognized and respected by the Organization and its Member States - primarily the right to independence  to sovereignty and to territorial integrity  which of necessity implies implementation of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly.Secondly  Lebanon  it is true  is a small country with a small population  but it has made up for that by the other assets with which nature has  fortunately  endowed it and which are familiar to the historians. That country  small in size but large in civilization  was the lighthouse that projected its beam over the waters of the port - a beam that was weak but that was none the less visible from far off the coast  in the gathering gloom of the night. Will not Lebanon - this country that is small but has an intense cultural impact - be rescued by this body in its hour of adversity?Thirdly  in fact  the whole region has borne the full brunt of the war in Lebanon  because peace in Lebanon cannot be dissociated from peace beyond its borders. Formerly  as everyone here well knows  Lebanon was like the white dove of peace. On more than one occasion  it held out the olive branch. It was a land of asylum for the needy. It zealously defended law and peace. That was the case formerly  as I have said  when it was a haven of peace - enough peace to fill the whole world. Unfortunately  when peace deserted my country  the tranquility of our neighbors left with it. That is why  unless we all make it our duty  without any further ado  to put out the flames consuming Lebanon  the fire may well spread to the whole region.Fourthly  on the strength of what we have physically experienced  we here that the Lebanon of former days - strong  independent and united - the Lebanon before the storm in 1975  was perfectly capable  because of its special geographical situation and its leading historical role  of shouldering its responsibilities and even of assisting others. But the Lebanon of today  weakened and bled white  has become a burden to itself and to this body. if  then  we see to it that this peace that has fled Lebanon is brought back to it  this body too will regain peace too.Lebanon is addressing itself not to the Assembly's emotions but to its conscience. Peace  and peace alone  can guarantee tranquility and the enjoyment of life to human beings  releasing their vital energy and promoting the development of the values they cherish  free from the fear of death and war - this horrible fate which wrests from them the state of grace that life represents. This tiny spot of light on the map of the world that Lebanon constitutes can become stronger in peacetime  until it is a luge flame spreading its beneficial glow to all around it.Today  my country is rent asunder by the difficult choice between the law of the jungle and the supremacy of the rule of law. But Lebanon - if only for reasons of its special situation - cannot assert the strength of power which it no longer has. Its strength must therefore be sought in legitimacy.Lebanon  a country of democratic tradition and openness to the world  made freedom a profession of faith  until it turned against us because of a cruel fate and a strange reversal of the scale of values  by which tolerance was confused with permissiveness and openness to others with anarchy - to the point that what had been its lifeblood became a weakness. It was then that the war of others burst on the Lebanese scene and settled there. It was then that some saw in Lebanon a choice land to which to export their conflicts  with their succession of misfortunes and destruction - and the tears of the widows and the orphans will never be able to wash away the blood of the innocent.And each time  the aggressor cane bade to our devastated homeland  which it thought it had brought to its knees  only to discover in the ruins the seeds of new life  to discover that there was still in the hearts of the Lebanese people an obstinate desire to live in their Motherland where they have such deep roots.Lebanon has had more than its share of suffering. It has endured the war of others and has suffered for others  with admirable courage  it has endured its sufferings with patience. Although it has sometimes had to bow before the tempest  it has risen up again and has remained defiant despite its sufferings. That is why it is high time that justice be done to this country  lest like Sanson it perish in the ruins of the fallen temple  bringing others down with it  in its own destruction.Throughout its history. Let-anon has braved these violent attacks. Each time it has tended its wounds and risen up again  firm as a rock  resisting valiantly; while its people has tenaciously rebuilt the ruins with loving care and once again opened wide its doors to the outside world. The winds that are blowing may uproot the brambles and shake the buildings  but it can do nothing against the majestic cedar  so deeply rooted in its native soil that their destinies are inseparable. And my country lives up to its emblem it is immortal.Lebanon must be the only country in the world with as many of its citizens scattered throughout the world as it has residing within its borders. Thus Lebanon shares the benefits of its creative genius with the whole world  and especially with all the countries that have given asylum to Lebanese.Consequently it is not in vain that Lebanon addresses the conscience of the world  which well appreciates the powerful influence of that country when it was at peace.In conclusion  when we recall that Lebanon was referred to in an epic dating back  to the ninth century B.C.  engraved in cuneiform characters on tablets ofclay  when we re-read in the passage of Homers' Odyssey describing the grotto of the Siren Calypso: ""The perfume of the cedar spread to each nook and cranny  filling it with scented air""  we understand that we have a duty not to fail in our historic mission.There are children in Lebanon who have never known anything but fear. The very least our duty to them requires is to teach them what peace means. Lebanon hopes to become again the white dove of peace  holding in its beak the olive branch  its brow encircled with a crown of cedar leaves  giving free reign to its love for freedom  sovereignty and independence  as well as its thirst for justice and beauty.Our President  to in Gemayel  said last year to this Assembly:""Lebanon has achieved the miracle of survival and it deserves to live indignity.""... On behalf of Lebanon I declare that it will survive at the crossroads where history and geography have placed it  a living example of a country devoted to law  justice  liberty and the dignity of man."" (A/40/PV. 42  p. 42)The Prime Minister  Mr. Bashid Karami  said  at the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly:""We have striven to make Lebanon a haven for freedom and humanity. This is our cherished legacy to be handed over intact to succeeding generations."" (A/39/PV. 22  p. 46)We salute this Organization  created to spread peace and security and to promote the advent of a world where life will be better. Our gratitude will go out to it when brave words are accompanied by deeds  when fine professions of faith prove to be more than mere words. That will indeed be a blessing for a nation enriched by its past  courageous in facing the dangers of the present  and looking to the future with hope."
"80",4007,"LBR",41,1986," I have the honor to bring to this Assembly warm greetings and best wishes from the President of Liberia  His Excellency Samuel Kanyon Doe  and the Government and people of Liberia whom I represent before this Assembly today.The Liberian Government is pleased at the unanimous election of Mr. Choudhury to preside over the forty-first session of the General Assembly. We have no doubt that with his exceptional qualifications and vast experience as a diplomat and statesman he will provide effective leadership to the Assembly. I assure him of the fullest co-operation of the Liberian delegation  which extends to him its warmest congratulations and best wishes for success.Similarly  we wish to express special thanks and appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies of Spain  for the excellent manner in which he presided over the fortieth session of the General Assembly. The far-reaching decisions taken during his tenure of office  especially when this Organization commemorated its fortieth anniversary  will undoubtedly contribute to the furtherance of world peace and security.Our esteemed Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  deserves special commendation for his tireless efforts to promote peace and economic prosperity in our world. We thank him for his very interesting report and assure him of the Liberian Government's continued support in this difficult and challenging task.For the past five years  since the Liberian Revolution of 1930  my predecessors have regularly informed this Assembly of the political situation and the institutionalization of the democratic process in Liberia. We ask the Assembly's kind indulgence as we continue this worthy tradition.Looking at the Liberian case in the perspective of other experiences  it is remarkable that just five years after the military takeover Liberia has succeeded in returning to civilian democratic rule. That is a credit to the military authorities  who have kept their promise to the Liberian people to restore democratic government after a period of five years. It was no surprise  therefore  that even though there was an abortive invasion of the country in November 1985  immediately following the October legislative and presidential elections  the transitional process was neither halted nor delayed. We are pleased to state that despite the difficult economic situation in the country the Government  -th its legislative  judiciary and executive branches  is functioning effectively in conformity with the new Constitution.The return to civilian democratic rule was not  however  the only goal of the Government. Socio-economic development and the improvement of the quality of life of every Liberian are also the subject of priority programs. In order to mobilize and direct our limited resources to these important objectives. President Doe's Government pursues a national policy based on unity  peace and stability.National reconciliation is a key aspect of this policy. That being so  the President has not only granted clemency to all those implicated in the abortive invasion of November 1985 but also ordered the return of confiscated properties to their rightful owners and he continues to call upon all Liberians in self-imposed exile to return home. Those and other measures are designed to lay the basis for the preservation of peace and the development of democratic institutions  so that our energies and resources may be devoted to the development of our nation.We have no doubts that with our commitment and dedication we will surmount the genuine problems and challenges of nation-building by means of a spirit of national unity and reconciliation. It is our sincere hope that we may count on the assistance of all friendly Governments in achieving our goal of unity  peace  stability and prosperity.Liberia will continue to pursue its foreign policy objectives  based on the promotion of peace  respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States  non-interference in the internal affairs of States  respect for human rights  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the right of all oppressed peoples to self-determination and independence. In this connection my Government will emphasize sub-regional  regional and international co-operation and promote friendly ties with all nations and peoples.Despite general recognition of the achievements of the United Nations  the Organization is experiencing a crisis of credibility  with criticism directed against its organizational structure and functions. Concern has been expressed about overloaded agendas  the slow pace of work and the proliferation of resolutions many of which are never implemented. Fingers are pointed at the many areas of tension around the world  the failure to achieve general and complete disarmament  the prevalence of human rights violations and the steady deterioration of economic relations between North and South. In short  the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security is being questioned as many unresolved international conflicts take the form of armed hostilities.We share the view that the credibility crisis which has troubled the united Nations has been due on the one hand to the insistence of the great Powers on vetoing Security Council resolutions which are unacceptable to them and on the other to the division  as it were  of the international system since 1945 into two rival ideological blocs  which continue to support opposite sides in most conflict situations. As a consequence  violence and anarchy have often characterized international relations. Some States  led astray by erroneous calculations or blinded by passion  resort to unlawful means in order to acquire or preserve economic benefits  gain political advantages or pursue selfish ambitions.Decisions and choices of action tend to promote national interests rather than collective goals. We have observed that rhetoric and posturing take the place of serious negotiations and diplomacy  while parochial interest is given primacy over the collective effort. Instead of using the mechanisms and procedures of the United Nations  Member States prefer to resolve their differences through the threat or use of force.In addition to the fundamental problems confronting it  the United Nations is faced with the current financial crisis  which threatens its very foundations and survival. We therefore welcome the report of the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations. It is my Government's considered view that much could be achieved by streamlining the vast United Nations bureaucracy. However  to cut programs arbitrarily would  in my delegation's view  seriously hamper international economic and technical co-operation.There are a number of major international issues before the Assembly which I should now like to address.The essence of global responsibility is solidarity and a collective effort to meet the challenges of our times. This is the mandate given to us under the Charter.We meet here in the Assembly  year after year  to express our common hopes for a better world beyond the narrow vision of national interest and to propose solutions to our common problems. Yet  Member States have not mustered the political will to make the accommodation and adjustment necessary to achieve these desired objectives. This has been conspicuously exemplified in international economic relations where our responses have not been commensurate with the seriousness of the problems confronting us.The unprecedented crisis in the world economy is affecting trade  financial and monetary relations. In most countries  the crisis has taken the form of rising inflation  serious recession and a worsening of social tensions. For the developing countries  there is the additional burden of the worsening terms of trade  difficulties in obtaining access to the financial markets  increasing burdens of debt servicing  and a disruptive decline in the level of development assistance. For most of these countries  the outlook is desperate and hopeless.We cannot build a better world or a secure world when the global economy continues to perpetuate such acute imbalances and gross inequalities. Unless wo can take bold and imaginative steps to reverse the present trend  our future prosperity and even our survival will remain uncertain.We must be constantly reminded that the difficult and controversial issues that divide the rich and the poor countries of the world cannot be solved by confrontation. They can be redressed by our political will to overcome differences and by our determination to produce significant and useful results. This calls for understanding  commitment and co-operation. Let us call upon these principles  to the benefit of all.The decline in commodity prices  the spread of protectionism  the decline in official development assistance and the increasing burden of indebtedness have had disastrous and alarming consequences for African economies. Added to these disturbances are the effects of prolonged drought and desertification.Africa is also handicapped by several disadvantages  particularly the fact that it includes 26 of the world's least developed countries and harbors the greatest number of refugees. These and other factors  such as low productive capacity  the lack of economic infrastructures and the mismanagement of resources  have denied the continent of benefits it should enjoy  considering its enormous mineral and human resources.We believe that the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly  on the critical economic situation in Africa  is a significant landmark in international co-operation and multilateralism Africa's Priority program for Economic Recovery (1986-1990) is a vivid expression of the collective resolve of African countries to meet their own economic and development challenges. However  the implementation of the United Nations program of action could give strength and vitality to Africa's efforts. This program deserves the full support of the international community and we applaud the significant contributions and concrete measures already taken by Canada and the Nordic countries in support of Africa's economic recovery.My Government commends the Government of Italy for its recent initiative in convening a meeting last week with foreign ministers of African countries to reaffirm Italy's commitment to render assistance and to consider the action to be taken to follow up on the thirteenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly. We certainly hope that other countries will follow Italy's positive lead.For a period of almost 40 years  the issue of apartheid has been discussed and debated by the Assembly. Apartheid is a negation of the ideals of the United Nations  inasmuch as the Organization itself emerged out of the ashes of a war fought against Nazism  which  like apartheid  rested on a spurious doctrine of racial superiority. Neither the condemnation nor the reformation of apartheid is enough and nothing short of its total elimination is acceptable. Only when apartheid is totally eradicated can we justify the existence of this Organization and the prime place given to the ""dignity of the human person"" in the Charter.For those countries which have kept apartheid alive  they have clearly demonstrated that they choose economic considerations over adherence to theprinciples of the Charter. In view of South Africa's intransigence  there is no doubt that any measure other than comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter and the intensification of the armed struggle can bring apartheid to an end.My Government rejects as a dishonest excuse for inaction the argument that comprehensive mandatory sanctions will only worsen the plight of the already suffering black people of South Africa. The Government of Liberia will therefore not relent in its support for comprehensive mandatory sanctions and for the liberation struggle until apartheid is completely eradicated.The Government of Liberia continues to view the question of Namibia with grave concern. The linkage of extraneous issues  particularly the withdrawal of Cuban troops  was calculated to deny the Namibian people enjoyment of their inalienable right to self-determination  freedom and independence. South Africa's illegal occupation of the Territory  though a defiance of the resolutions of the United Nations  and its establishment of an interim administration  have been supported by foreign economic interests in order to maintain access to the resources and wealth of the Territory.My delegation categorically rejects the call for the withdrawal of Cuban troops as a condition for Namibia's independence. We support a negotiated settlement on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) with the full participation of the South West Africa People's Organization  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people.In the interest of peace a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement in the Middle East must be achieved without delay. The state of affairs in this region must therefore continue to receive our close attention. The basic elements of a settlement which we support involve the withdrawal of Israel from all territories occupied since the 1967 war  recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  and acknowledgment of the rights of all States in the area to live in peace and security within secure and internationally recognized borders.The continuation of the war between Iran and Iraq - now in its seventh year  is a most tragic and unfortunate development. We therefore appeal to the leaders of the two countries to permit the Secretary-General to use his good offices in negotiating an end to the hostilities. The continued resort to force by the two sides has not only resulted in untold human sufferings for their two peoples but has also seriously affected international shipping in the Gulf region.In this connection ray Government must register its deep concern about the continued indiscriminate bombings in the Gulf region of international shipping  including vessels flying the Liberian flag  in complete violation of international law and the right of innocent passage.My Government rejects intervention  interference and armed occupation wherever they occur as an infringement of the Charter and the territorial integrity and sovereign rights of States. Those that pursue policies of armed intervention should be reminded that the will of a freedom-loving people cannot easily be bent or subdued by force. The gallant people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea must be assisted to resist foreign domination and repression. While a political settlement is being worked out in those regions  humanitarian assistance to the refugee population should continue on an increased basis.The delegation of Liberia is concerned about developments in Central America. The Contadora initiative should not be allowed to lose its momentum  committed as it is to peace  democracy  social justice and economic freedom in Central America. We commend the Contadora spirit  which provides the most viable option for the peaceful resolution of the problems in Central America.My delegation is equally concerned about the dispute over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Argentina. We support a negotiated settlement of the dispute and urge the two parties not to allow their differences to prevent the development of a formula that would enable them to engage in meaningful dialog. We strongly believe that oily renewed confidence and the normalization of relations between the two countries can reduce tension in the South Atlantic.In our pursuit of world peace and security it is important to refer to the sensitive political situation that continues to divide South and North Korea. The reunification of the Korean people is a matter to be decided by them throughthe holding of direct talks  and they deserve the support and encouragement of the international community. My delegation believes that United Nations membership for the two Koreas could increase the opportunity for dialog and co-operation and enhance the prospects for peace on the peninsula and peaceful relations between them.In no area is the distortion of human priorities as glaring as in the area of the arms race  and in no area is the need for commitment to the principles of the Charter more important and more closely tied to the survival of humanity than in the field of disarmament and arms limitation.Indeed  the enormous expenditure on weapons of mass destruction has not made the wot Id any more secure. On the contrary  the arms race has increased fear and anxiety through a balance of terror with a killing power that could destroy our planet several times over. What is even more disquieting is that the enormous waste is not limited to the big Powers alone. Third-world nations too are diverting their meager resources away from the basic needs of their peoples into armaments.We are often told that the justification for the arms race is security. But enduring peace and security cannot be built on the accumulation of weaponry and strategic superiority. Real security can be found only in common security - that is  security for all. Such security lies in a life that is free from fear and want  hinger and disease  ignorance and unemployment  poverty and despair. This kind of security can be realized only if the arms race is halted and the funds released are allocated to socio-economic development throughout the world.The widespread resort to acts of terrorism by individuals  groups and even States has become a major development in international relations today. While we acknowledge that the root causes of terrorism must be addressed  there can be no justification for the maiming  torture and killing of innocent people. There is an urgent need for concerted international efforts to take decisive action to combat terrorism. My Government has recently enacted legislation that imposes the death penalty on anyone convicted of either engaging in or attempting to perpetrate acts of terrorism.In conclusion  my delegation believes that the crucial factor in the effectiveness of the united Nations is the attitude of the Member States  and not specific provisions of the Charter. Although the Charter proclaims the sovereign equality of all Member states  we are aware that some countries have a greater capacity to influence international events. Therefore  those States  in my opinion  must set the pace in making the United Nations system relevant and effective.Economic security is as indispensable to a just and equitable international order as political security. The aim of a new international economic order is to provide security and justice through the elimination of hunger  poverty and socio-economic disparities between the rich and the poor. It constitutes one of the principal guarantees of the creation of better conditions for all peoples to enjoy a life based on human dignity.The United Nations was founded to translate such aspirations into reality. Let us recommit and rededicate ourselves to the lofty goals and objectives of the United Nations "
"81",4053,"LBY",41,1986," On behalf of the delegation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  I should like to congratulate Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury on his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. I am confident that he will lead the work of the Assembly to a successful conclusion. I must also express appreciation of the work of Mr. Jaime de Pinies  President of the fortieth session.We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his efforts to ensure the survival of the United Nations and the enhancement of its role.Recently the people of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya commemorated the sixteenth anniversary of the expulsion of the last fascist from the Jamahiriya  thus setting the seal on the termination of an era in Libyan history characterized by racist  colonialist domination.As our people celebrated this anniversary over the years  they renewed their pledge to resist this odious type of policy which prevailed during the last century and which some Powers are trying to impose in this century. For 41 years the United Nations has been trying to find a way to eliminate this scourge which has prevailed and is still prevailing in the world.While history records that this Organization  the United Nations  has achieved some victories in decolonization in some parts of the world  which resulted in the accession of some territories to independence  it will also record that in some cases this independence was incomplete  while in others it is still threatened. Their independence is being jeopardized by a policy of hegemony  aggression  and the withholding and plunder of resources.The United Nations  throughout its history and during the present year  has seen how the independence of its Member States can be unprotected.Let us look at the economic war threatening the poor  small States. Let us see how some of the States Members of this Organization are not only negotiating with other States  but rather with private institutions; and how some Members of our Organization are not only bargaining over how to repay their debts or manage their institutions  but are bargaining over the pawning of their wealth and natural resources.The experience of the special session of the General Assembly on the grave economic situation in one of the continents of the world was a source of disappointment  not only for the Member States but also for the peoples  which believed for 41 years that they had established a collective system to protect their security and safety.During this year  the International Year of Peace  the United States of America committed a blatant act of aggression against the Jamahiriya  a State Member of the United Nations.There is no dichotomy between our people's celebration the other day of the anniversary of the expulsion of fascism from our soil and the fact that our delegation is making its statement today before the General Assembly. Fascism in the Mediterranean used to believe that the northern coasts of Africa are an extension of its European coasts. Fascism in the United States of America still believes that  the coasts of the Mediterranean  in the South  the North  the East and the West are an extension of American hegemony over international politics.The United States  through its policy of aggression  is attempting to subjugate the littoral States of the Mediterranean and force them to adopt a policy that accords with its own political approach.Let us cast a clear look at the state of affairs. On 16 April of this year  the United States  with the assistance of the United Kingdom  sent its warplanes to Benghazi and Tripoli to launch raids against innocent civilians in the Jamahiriya. These raids were designed inter alia to murder the leader of the Jamahiriya.The peoples of the world did not stand idly by before this brutal act ofI am sure that those who signed the San Francisco Charter signed it on behalf of these people. Z am certain that our President here is aware of the denunciation and condemnation engendered by the brutal and wanton act of aggression against theThis is a matter that should not be passed over in silence. This international Assembly must view it from all angles.On the one hand  this aggression still persists since the present American Administration has decided to adopt the approach of attempting to combat the progressive policy of the Jamahiriya. The Administration is still waging media and psychological warfare  not only with the view of misleading American public opinion but of misleading international public opinion. This includes the peoples and nations and Governments of the world.During the last few days the extent of the disinformation practiced by the Administration has been proven. In this regard we can clearly conclude that all the allegations leveled by the American Administration against the Jamahiriya fall within this disinformation campaign. And the alleged reason for its aggression against the Jamahiriya falls within this misleading false campaign. On the other hand  the bombing of cities and the murder of innocent civilians is neither a beginning nor an end to aggression. The United States Administration  since 1973  has taken measures designed to undermine the sovereignty of the Jamahiriya  to prevent it from exercising its sovereignty through the adoption of international and internal positions  respect for which is provided for in the Charter. These measures took the form of restrictions on trade and on the transfer of technology  which was upgraded to an economic boycott  and then ended in the unjust freezing of properties and assets. Then this took the form of military acts of provocation off the Libyan shore  using the threat of force and even resorting to the actual use of force. The brutal criminal act of aggression on 16 April did not come to an end. The Administration is still undertaking its maneuvers and acts of provocation off Libya's shores and is still taking financial and economic measures and pursuing its policy of disinformation against the Jamahiriya.Thus  this approach  adopted by the American Administration as official policy against a State Member of the United Nations  constitutes a blatant and continuous act of aggression which runs counter to the Charter  adopted by the international community as its own constitution since the elimination of the last Fascist attest to dominate international politics. The world stands today confronted by this desire on the part of a major Power to exercise hegemony and domination. The world is called upon to act to put an end to this policy.The brutal act of aggression by American fascism is not new  be it in the Mediterranean or in other regions. The American Navy shelled civilians in Beirut  and the same infernal war machine of the American militarists attempted to violate the sovereignty of Iran  and successive American Administrations accepted the death of Americans themselves in Viet Nam  and the United States of America invaded Grenada and besieged Cuba. And this brutal Administration supports the Contras in Angola and Nicaragua and is still supporting the Zionists in occupied Palestine and the racists in South Africa.The international community represented in the United Nations cannot condone these repeated premeditated practices on the part of the ^ministration. These practices assume a more serious character when engaged in by a major Power  one of the five States permanent members of the Security Council. The Charter entrusted these States with the maintenance of international peace and security  which it emphasizes be undertaken through word and deed. The United States has contravened the Charter in both word and deed. It was the United States that bombed cities and murdered innocent civilians. It was the United States that exercised the right of veto to prevent the Security Council from condemning its acts of aggression. Forty-one years after its adoption the Charter has been violated through the use of bonbers and the right of veto in an unprecedented arrogant Fascist manner.Without going into the legal bases which govern affairs in the world  the fact that the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference condemned the brutal act of aggression by the United States against the Jamahiriya is sufficient proof that the peoples of the world - some of whose representatives signed the Charter - consider the practices of the United States acts of aggression against a Member State of those organizations and of the United Nations and grounds not only for denunciation and condemnation but  rather  as a grave development jeopardizing international peace and security. There will never be a lack of honorable voices within the international community and American society itself which brand these acts of aggression as cowardly  base and hideous.To return to my original subject  our people recently celebrated the sixteenth anniversary of the elimination of the last manifestations of fascism. This means that we will continue to resist any manifestation of fascism  whether it ispracticed against us or targeted against others. If this is the reason for neo-fascism to commit aggression against us  then we will stand up to that aggression and repel it.At the appropriate time and place the delegation of the Jamahiriya will discuss the items on the agenda. My delegation will concentrate  in particular  on the questions of Palestine  South Africa and the international economic situation.The Assembly will see for itself that the confrontation between the United States and the Jamahiriya has no basis and that the allegations of the United States Administration have proved to be false. Rather  the confrontation is based on the fact that we resist the racism of the Zionists in occupied Palestine  the usurpation of the rights of its peoples  the racism of the Government of Pretoria arid its oppression of the indigenous population and the unjust economic situation which led to the impoverishment and starvation of the peoples of the third world in the interest of the industrialized developed world.The Assembly is already aware that the United States Administration supports the Zionists in occupied Palestine and provides them with the means not only of continuing their usurpation of the rights of the peoples of Palestine  but of seeking persistently to dominate the entire region and subject some of the rulers to their domination  making them their quislings and lackeys.The Assembly will see that the United States Administration resists the subjugation of the Pretoria regime and seeks to strengthen it  and that it pursues an economic policy aimed at preventing the peoples of the world from controlling the sources of their natural wealth and at creating an economic imbalance which would lead to the control of its monopolies over the international division of labor. This is the touchstone and the real confrontation. As for the allegations of the American Administration  they simply do not hold water.My delegation will debate State terrorism. As for that State which turns the Mediterranean basin - a basin for peace - into a lake for its maneuvers  acts of provocation and the hegemony of its fleet  the Assembly will see  as everybody has seen  the falseness of the allegations which it has leveled against our people.We stand at the side of the liberation movements of the world  but we are against attacking civilians. It is impossible for a people that has lived for 30 years as a victim of fascism  which it has resisted  and which has suffered the aggression of a major Power  to be an instrument of terrorism. The American Administration fabricated its pretext to justify its aggression and ray delegation will have its say regarding this matter.In the final analysis  there is only one thing to sayi the General Assembly  while celebrating the International Year of Peace  which is the culmination of 41 years of its history  must transform itself into a public trial of the perfidy of the United States Administration. There will be no reason to glorify the Charter or praise its articles without a practical implementation thereof. There is no r a is on d'etre for international Organizations if they do not stand in defence of the rights of their members. The Charter calls for the maintenance of international peace and security  respect for the principle of the equal rights of peoples and the prohibition of the use or threat of force. We are confident that under Mr. Choudiury's presidency of this session of the Assembly we can find the way leading to respect for the Charter and the implementation of its articles."
"82",4158,"LKA",41,1986,"It gives me great pleasure to see you. Sir  a distinguished son of South Asia  presiding ever this forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. The people of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have a long tradition of friendship and co-operation. We are partners in the pursuit of peace and economic progress in many forums - not only at the United Nations  but also in the Non-Aligned Group of States  the Commonwealth of Nations  the Colombo Plan and  most recently  in the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation  a grouping which held its first summit in your historic capital. Our congratulations and warmest good wishes go to you  and the General Assembly can look forward with confidence to a successful session under your guidance and wise chairmanship.We also wish to express our appreciation to Ambassador Pinies of Spain for his exemplary conduct of the Assembly's work during the historic fortieth commemorative session.We meet at a time when the basic needs of the millions of underprivileged in the developing nations are nowhere near being satisfied despite our determined efforts to adopt policies based on the realities of an interdependent world. The inequalities and imbalances of the existing economic situation act as a barrier to progress.Primary commodity agricultural economies are faced with declining commodity prices which impose intolerable strains on their balance of trade and balance of payments. Newly industrialized countries  on the other hand  are checkmated by arbitrarily imposed protectionist measures derogating from the principle of free trade in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) . The transfer of resources is clogged by interest rates which are still too high for developing-country borrowers. Conditions imposed by lenders in their turn force adjustments the harshness of which creates social and political instability. The dominance of the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in the world economy is a reality  and we recognize it  but with that dominance must come responsibility to manage the world economy in such a manner as to ensure justice for all and the continued efficiency of the system for mutual benefit  a comprehensive view of the global economy must remain in sight if we are not to perpetuate the inequalities of the present system. If efficiency is the criterion  then let it be applied uniformly in the economics of production on a global scale without penalizing countries for their lower costs. If State subsidies give unfair advantages  then State intervention to bail out ailing corporations and multinationals must also be contrary to the proclaimed values of privatization. If free trade is championed in the services sector to allow open competition in all economies  then  equally  free trade in goods  without quota restrictions and other protectionist barriers  must prevail.The problems facing the world economy and requiring urgent action arise from the inadequacy of the recovery of the economies of the Western industrialized countries. The over-expansion of some of those economies financed by foreign borrowings leads to a high level of indebtedness and a consequent loss of confidence. Expansionary action elsewhere in the OECD to compensate for problems within the United States economy is crucial because of its impact on the growth performance of developing countries and their capacity to meet the burden of debt servicing. The crisis also signifies an opportunity  if an appropriate redistribution of balance of payments surpluses and deficits takes place. Central questions regarding the character of an inflationary onset after expansion  the impact of higher real wages on employment  and the role of developing countries  need to be addressed in any policy context today.Opportunities to correct the global economic situation are never lacking. At Punta del Este  the GATT Ministerial Conference has just concluded with the promise of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. Next year the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VII) will be held  and we oust approach that Conference with shared views on how we can restructure the world economy. The North-South dialogF has too long been a dialog of the deaf.Perhaps both sides need to modify their agendas  striving for immediately attainable goals involving some relief for the developing countries  leaving the more elaborate tasks for a later period when world economic conditions improve. Realism is not a sign of weakness. At the same time  it must be Hatched by a corresponding willingness to make some concessions in the global interest.Let roe now turn from economic co-operation to political co-operation.The need for international co-operation in the current political scene isdramatically evident in respect of southern Africa and the Middle East  where thepotential for peace available in ready-made proposals and plans remains tragically not utilizedThe question of Namibia is one such obvious issue  on which we met in special session last week. Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  adopted unanimously in 1978  provides a detailed plan for the independence of Namibia on which all parties are agreed.It is the intransigence of the apartheid regime of South Africa and the reluctance and political permissiveness of those who have the power of persuasion over that regime that has prevented the people of Namibia from enjoying freedom and independence.It is the minority apartheid regime that is the tap root of the instability in the entire region of southern Africa. Within South Africa the regime has reacted with increasing repression and brutality to the nation-wide mass agitation for freedom. Clearly  there cannot be any peace or regional stability until the hideous structure of apartheid is totally dismantled. An essential step towards this goal is the unconditional release of all political prisoners  particularly Nelson Mandela  and the removal of the ban on the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC)  to permit the participation of South African patriots in any dialog with the apartheid regime for the establishment of a multiracial democratic society based on majority rule.The evil empire of apartheid extends its baneful influence over independent neighboring States  committing acts of aggression and destabilization against those States. The minority regime has manipulated armed groups to carry out cross-border terrorism against Angola  even occupying portions of its territory.The International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa  held in Paris  reached a decision that the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions was the most effective peaceful means of eradicating apartheid. At this session of the United Nations the General Assembly must mobilize international opinion against apartheid and co-ordinate a decisive consensus in order to prevent a bloody and violent climax in South Africa.The States in the Middle East cannot expect to live in peace and security until and unless the central factor of regional instability  the core of the Middle East problem  the question of Palestine  is faced squarely and solved justly. The inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people must be restored  including the right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland in safety  their right to self-determination and their right to establish an independent sovereign State without external interference or coercion. It is our position that Israel must withdraw from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories and that Israel must dismantle the illegal settlements it has set up in the occupied territories. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  must be a party to any negotiations leading to a settlement of the Middle East question. We support the peace plan adopted at the twelfth Arab summit conference held at Fez in 1982.The agony of Lebanon is not an isolated phenomenon  but a part of the Middle East question. We declare our solidarity with the Government and people of Lebanon. We call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon to ensure the exercise of sovereignty by the Lebanese Government and people over its territory.The presence of foreign forces in Cyprus has compounded an internal issue involving two communities cm that island into one of great complexity involving the de facto division of the island. We call for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Republic. It is our view that foreign interference or intervention cannot be justified on any grounds  least of all in defense of ethnic kinship. As a member of the Non-Aligned Contact Group on Cyprus  Sri Lanka is especially concerned with the situation in Cyprus  a State facing the threat of separatism aggravated by external factors. Any settlement of the question of Cyprus must be freely arrived at and must be acceptable to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and its two communities. We support the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General to achieve a settlement based cm the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus.Tension is a fact in South«West Asia because of the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan. We have always expressed our support for a political settlement that would include the withdrawal of foreign troops  and in this context we welcome the Soviet Union's commitment to withdraw some of its troops by the end of this year. We hope that an early solution will be found which would enable the Afghan refugees to return to their homes in safety and honor so that the people of Afghanistan may be able to exercise their sovereignty without interference or intervention from any quarter.In South-East Asia  collective security can be preserved only in an international environment in which nations can govern themselves freely and in which foreign troops do not violate the sovereignty of nations. We support all efforts to achieve a comprehensive political solution that would lead to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchea. This step is vital to the restoration of normalcy and the creation of a climate of confidence and understanding in South-East Asia.The armed conflict between Iraq and Iran has brought great grief to the two countries  with tragic loss of life and destructive effects on their economies. Sri Lanka  which enjoys the closest relations with both countries  hopes that the various efforts to bring about a settlement acceptable to both parties will be pursued with all vigor and earnestness.In Central America  the right of all nations to coexist peacefully despite differences in their political and economic systems must be upheld. We support the Contadora process and urge all parties to accept this as a viable regional initiative based on the true interests of regional peace.We support the right of Nicaragua to decide on its own political  economic and social system without outside interference. The basic tenets of international law and the application of these by recognized institutions must be respected in working out good-neighborly relations with other countries in the region.Great Power military presence and confrontation in the Indian Ocean have not abated  and tension continues to escalate in the area. The proposal for the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean was born of the determination of the people of the Indian Ocean area to preserve their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and to resolve their political  economic and social problems in conditions of peace and tranquility.Seven years ago  in 1979  the Indian Ocean States secured virtual unanimity in the adoption of 11 principles of agreement for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. The United Nations functions on the basis of consensus  and what is now required is an exercise of greater political will and a sense of commitment to decisions already adopted which will ensure the establishment of a zone of peace.Sri Lanka looks forward to hosting the conference on the Indian Ocean as soon as preparatory work for that conference has been completed  at a date no later than 1988 I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to another initiative by Sri Lanka - the declaration by the United Nations of 1987 as the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless. An elaborate Program has been formulated  with strategies and over-all plans for national and international action for the period preceding and following that International Year. That Program is based on the belief that housing does not merely provide protection from the elements but also shelters all the diverse stabilizing components that together improve the quality of life. The success of that project will be determined largely by the degree of support it receives from the international community.On a global scale  the area where our common destiny is most at risk is that of the failure to achieve general and complete disarmament. In this International Year of Peace  military expenditures are running at almost a trillion dollars per annum  and some 50 000 nuclear warheads are poised to destroy mankind and all its creative endeavors on this planet several times over. Disarmament issues  and the need to release the energy and resources now being expended on armaments for peaceful economic and social development  have figured prominently since the first Non-Aligned Summit in Belgrade.The messages sent out by that Summit to the leaders of the two super-Powers remain milestones in the endeavor by third world countries to promote bilateral negotiations to achieve peace. Since then  all third world declarations have attached great importance to disarmament  and the first special session devoted to disarmament  in 1978  when Sri Lanka was Chairman of the Movement  was an outstanding non-aligned initiative  culminating in the final document of that conference  which serves as a charter for disarmament negotiations.Regrettably  the ideals  agenda and machinery set out in that document have not been realized. However  the extension of the multilateral process to the field of disarmament negotiations and the active involvement of the non-aligned nations in that process are irreversible facts.The conference on the relationship between disarmament and development is now scheduled to be held next year  in 1987. The conference is a global imperative  and we look forward to universal participation in the conference  with adequate preparation to permit the achievement of concrete results. In the field of disarmament  the agenda requiring action is urgent and will brook no delay. The overwhelming demand by the peoples and nations of the world for an end to nuclear testing is still being opposed  even after verification arrangements have clearly been shown to be adequate. We endorse the Mexico Declaration by six fellow non-aligned leaders and call on the nuclear Powers to call a moratorium before negotiating the nuclear test ban to which some of them have pledged themselves through international treaty commitments.Sri Lanka has long associated itself with the prevention of an arms race in outer space. We call once again for early negotiations of an agreement or agreements  as appropriate  to ban weapons - including anti-satellite weapons - in outer space before the arms being developed in research laboratories are translated into destructive reality.Twenty-five years ago  the non-aligned States met in Belgrade. In their Declaration  they asked that outer space be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and called for the establishment of an international agency to promote international co-operation in that area. That call has recently been renewed  and we support it.Another form of violence to which humanity has been subjected in this century is the crime of terrorism  by which innocent human beings become the victims of sudden  indiscriminate killing. This problem has acquired an international dimension  as terrorists frequently operate from across State boundaries. Certainly  the underlying causes of terrorism must be eradicated  but in the meantime the international community must take decisive action to counter terrorism whenever and wherever it erupts.Sri Lanka's position is that traditional international extradition legislation must be modified so that the political motivations advanced to justify certain terrorist actions will no longer suffice to deter the extradition of persons who have committed heinous crimes  including mass murder.Certain European States have entered into bilateral agreements which prevent terrorists from fleeing across borders to avoid punishment for their crimes. Within the regional grouping to which Sri Lanka belongs  the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAA8C)  steps are being taken to promote regional co-operation in the eradication of this pestilence. At the Eighth Summit of the Non-Aligned Countries held in Harare  Zimbabwe  Heads of State condemned all terrorist activities and called on all States to fulfill their obligations under international law to refrain from organizing  instigating  assisting or participating in terrorist acts in other States or acquiescing in activities within their territories for the commission of such acts. Adherence to those principles is a precondition for combating terrorism in any part of the world.Permit me to volunteer some observations on the domestic situation in Sri Lanka which has received publicity and projection in the international media. It has been the consistent view of ray President  Mr. J.R. Jayewardene  that this issue should find a political solution  to which end he has striven hard during the past three years. In 1984 he set up a round-table conference which was attended by all parties concerned  except the Tamil terrorist groups. After one year's deliberations  presided over by the President himself  efforts to find a political solution acceptable to all parties were not successful because the main Tamil groups did not agree to the proposals of the majority. Again during the past two months negotiations have been resumed and the talks have progressed satisfactorily. The successful conclusion of the talks now depend on the willingness of the terrorists to be a part of the democratic process. We are thankful to those friendly countries which have been with us in this hour of trial and stress  especially India  our immediate neighbor. Any solution we arrive atmust preserve the multi-ethnic  multilinguistic  multireligious and unitary status of an undivided Sri Lanka.A memorandum has been circulated on behalf of the European Economic Community (EEC) by the representative of the United Kingdom in which reference has been made to Sri Lanka.Sri Lanka has learn from the experience of some EEC countries facing similar problems that such complex issues concerning tensions between communities in any country are best settled without elevating them to the status of ""grave world problems"".There are many situations elsewhere in the world comparable to that in Sri Lanka  and those situations have persisted for several years without being raised in the United Nations. It would be unreasonable to expect Sri Lanka to solve overnight a problem with a major terrorist dimension. We are keener and more anxious than anyone else to find an early solution to this problem and are confident that we have the will and capacity to do so  provided all the parties in Sri Lanka co-operate to create the necessary atmosphere of peace and security to implement a political solution and all countries committed to the eradication of terrorism extend to us their unqualified and unreserved support.It is not Sri Lanka's intention to permit this problem to reach the size and status of a world problem threatening international peace and security. Therefore  we would appreciate it if the EEC countries wishing to see a political settlement in Sri Lanka also place this problem in its proper perspective.The fortieth session  as the President of the General Assembly himself observed in his introductory comments last week  was a time for both celebration and reflection. Never had so many world leaders gather together to participate in a session of the United Nations General Assembly and never had such impassioned commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter and the United Nationssystem been expressed. However  hardly had those voices died down when the United Nations began to reel under what is described as its worst financial crisis. It is clear that what we are confronting is a fundamental crisis of political proportions far beyond a financial shortfall. At the root is antagonism towards multilateralism and a tendency to lapse into myopic unilateral^  which appears as an attractive and convenient path to those with economic or political might  or both.Wisely  long-term and medium-term remedies were sought  attacking the cause rather than the symptoms. During the current session this crisis is likely to affect the consideration of all issues on the agenda. Let us be realistic. If we reform the united Nations structurally  administratively and financially to present a model of rectitude  wise management and good husbandry  we will still need to deal with this tendency that seeks to drift away from multilateralism and global co-operation. This is the base of the new challenge that this body must face.is there a crisis of confidence in the United Nations and its inability to settle the major outstanding issues of the day? As a parliamentarian of more than 20 years' experience  I view the world as our electorate or our constituency. The media have focused on the United Nations administrative and other weaknesses which have been examined by an Expert Group. Unfortunately  not much light has been thrown on how the Organization has failed to implement its own decisions. Let us examine the record - in respect of apartheid in South Africa  in respect of Namibia  in respect of the Middle East  in respect of Central America  in respect of disarmament issues  and in respect of international economic issues.I referred earlier to the question of Namibia as a glaring instance of theimpotence crippling this Organization. Most of us are more transgressed againstthan transgressing. Yet we are collectively answerable for the failure toimplement our own decisions. We have a collective responsibility to heed theinjunctions in the document to which we all profess allegiance  the United Nations Charter.Let us be fair to the Organization  now caught up in a mood of self-analysis and introspection. The fault lies not in our Organization  but in ourselves. Our obligations under Article 103 of the Charter are of a higher priority than any other international obligations. For small States like my own  nothing would better guarantee our security and our independence than observance of the Charter. History will judge us by our performance  not by the piety of our pronouncements."
"83",4200,"LSO",41,1986,"On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Lesotho and on ay own behalf  I wish to offer you. Sir  our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly.Last year the Heads of State or Government assembled in this Hall to commemorate the fortieth birthday of the Organization  take stock of the achievements and failures of the United Nations system and  above all  renew their commitment to the noble ideals and lofty goals of the Charter.We were gratified to note that all the leaders gathered here for the fortieth session held the common position that the lessons of the Second World War are as pertinent today as they were 40 years ago. In the aftermath of the war the world witnessed with hope the birth of the United Nations and the dawn of multilateralism. It was hoped that all nations would agree to subject their individual and nationalistic interests to the international consensus envisaged in the Charter. It was the overwhelming desire of the peoples of the world that the United Nations  through its Charter  should banish wars for ever from the face of the earth.A sober assessment of the role and performance of the United Nations in international affairs in the last 41 years will reveal that on the issues of war and peace the Organization has not acquitted itself too well. Since the end of the Second World War over 150 wars and skirmishes of varying intensity and duration have occurred in different parts of the world  bringing in their wake untold suffering to millions of people.All these tragic events have called into question the effectiveness of the global machinery for the resolution of disputes. The Security Council  which is the supreme organ of the United Nations responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security  has been unable to arrest situations leading towar and has often remained powerless in the face of naked aggression. At tines the collective will of the international community has been frustrated either by the lack of political will on the part of Member States or by the indiscriminate use of the right of veto.The apparent tendency to withdraw from multilateralism and resort instead to bilateral diplomacy has weakened the international consensus  with the result that many regional and global disputes no longer lend themselves to equitable solutions.The United Nations is the mirror image of the attitude of its Member States. Without the political commitment of Members to resort to tie machinery of the United Nations to resolve disputes  and without the political will to abide strictly by the resolutions of the Organization  the problems of Kampuchea  Afghanistan  Central America  the Middle East and southern Africa will continue to undermine international peace and security.The shortcomings of the Organization in the resolution of regional disputes through the peaceful process of negotiations should not detract from its notable achievements in the fields of decolonization and development. The United Nations has not only ushered many of our countries into independence and sovereignty  but also helped to avert a third world war. Never before has the world enjoyed more than 40 years of uninterrupted global peace. The United Nations has thus become a unique forum where States meet and exchange views on a basis of sovereign equality. The founding fathers of the Organization had the wisdom and vision to recognize that  unless hunger  ignorance and disease were eliminated  world peace was bound to be difficult to achieve. They therefore established the Economic and Social Council as one of the main organs  whose task it is to co-ordinate the developmental activities of the United Nations. It is in this area that the United Nations  through its specialized agencies  has recorded notable achievements in the fight against hunger and disease  especially in Africa. Millions of refugees and other stateless persons around the world have found a home within the United Nations system.We have noted with satisfaction the spirit of international co-operation that underlined the deliberations of the special session of the General Assembly on the economic crisis in Africa. African leaders have not only recognized the gravity of the economic crisis engulfing the continent  but undertaken to initiate structural reforms in their economies and also committed themselves to shouldering the major portion of the burden of financial resources needed to rekindle the flame of development in Africa. We commend the Member States of the United Nations  especially the donor countries  and also the Secretary-General for the concern they have demonstrated with respect to the crisis in Africa.Lesotho  as a member of the community of nations  is also concerned about developments in southern Africa  particularly South Africa. We seek neither to interfere in the internal affairs of that country nor to participate in the racial conflict that is taking place there. However  the situation inside South Africa and the international community's reaction to it in the form of economic sanctions have become matters of immediate concern to us in Lesotho. As the Assembly is aware  Lesotho is completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa  therefore events in that country have an immediate and direct impact on Lesotho. We cannot afford the luxury of ignoring the sanctions issue by pretending that it is none of our business because there is no apartheid in Lesotho. We are aware that we shall be at the receiving end of whatever economic measures are taken against South Africa by the international community. I therefore take this opportunity to address  through you  Mr. President  an urgent appeal to the world community to put together a package of measures to cushion Lesotho against the impact of sanctions. Lesotho  as a peace-loving country  advocates dialog for the resolution of international and local disputes. It is in this context that we have always called on the people of South Africa  both black and white  to sit down together to resolve the racial problems now confronting their country* As violence escalates in South Africa  we have to offer asylum to an increasingly large number of South African refugees. We shall continue to receive these victims of apartheid in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 Convention on refugees.Lesotho has  however  instituted  since 1983 a policy whereby refugees whose lives are in danger are evacuated to other countries far afield. In this respect we wish to register our thanks to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Governments of Zambia  Tanzania  Kenya and Zimbabwe for their assistance and co-operation in this effort aimed at securing the safety of the South African refugees. Our policy of evacuating refugees does not in any way indicate a lessening of our resolve to receive in our midst those fleeing from oppression and persecution. It is a policy based on a realistic appreciation of Lesotho's vulnerability and lack of means to defend itself. Since 1982 a number of Lesotho citizens have been caught in cross-fire during South African military attacks against refugees in our country.The people of Namibia are yearning for freedom and independence in their own country. They have sought recourse to the United Nations in the fervent hope that the illegal occupation of their country will cease. It is incumbent upon the United Nations to bring independence to Namibia without pre-conditions or linkage to extraneous and irrelevant considerations.In respect of the situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea  Lesotho wishes to reiterate its well-known position on non-interference in the internal affairs of States. For many years now  the Organization has passed resolutions demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and Kampuchea and the collatecessation of external interference in the affairs of those countries so that their peoples can exercise their right to sovereignty and independence without fear of foreign intervention.The Middle East  which is another hotbed of tension  has dominated the agenda of the United Nations for many years  we recognize that the State of Israel has the right to exist within secure and recognized pre-1967 borders and that  similarly  the Palestinian people have an inalienable right to a State of their own.The signing of the Camp David accord between Egypt and Israel represented a significant attempt to address the issues of. war and peace in the Middle East. Lesotho will continue to support all efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.A close and probing look at the current disputes around the world  with the accompanying nuclear-arms race between the super-Powers  has revealed how precariously man stands on the brink of the abyss of total destruction. Since a nuclear war will never be fought because it cannot be won by either side  nuclear weapons have become unnecessary. Global peace cannot be maintained by subjecting the world to a perpetual threat of nuclear holocaust. The policy of deterrence is as unsound as the concept of a nuclear war itself. The vast array of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems now in the possession of the nuclear Powers far exceeds the requirements of the security of those Powers.in any case  we are informed that each of the super-Powers is capable of destroying humanity many times over; and yet it has always been found sufficient to destroy life once only. The question that comes to mind is why so much human  technological and financial resources is being expended on a pointless and wasteful arms race. At a time when the world economic situation is far from encouraging  with deepening recession and mounting indebtedness in the developing world  vast resources critically needed for development are being squandered on the arms race.My country stands for complete and verifiable disarmament. We recognize the need to reduce the level of tension and mistrust that have characterized relations between the super-Powers. We hope that the second summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union will make noticeable progress on the issue of nuclear disarmament and its bearing on international peace andI cannot conclude without saying a few words on the decolonization process and the principal role of the United Nations in it. Twenty-five years ago  in 1960  the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in resolution 1514 (XV). When the Declaration was adopted the majority of the countries represented here had rot yet shed the colonial yoke. Even as we look back with some satisfaction at the progress made in decolonization under United Nations auspices  we notice with dismay that there still exist pockets of colonial domination in Africa  the South Pacific and other areas of the world. The peoples of the remaining colonies and dependencies deserve their place in the community of sovereign nations.I have previously alluded to the world economic situation and it is my intention to make some additional remarks on the subject on this occasion.We regret that the process of global negotiations on the new economic relationship between the industrialized countries and the countries of the third world have been suspended  with no sign that they will soon be resumed. The rising tide of protectionism  the negative flow of resources between the North and the South  high interest rates and the increasing indebtedness of the developing countries are the biggest challenge of our time. The threat of a trade war involving two or more of the industrialized countries hovers over the horizon with catastrophic implications for world trade. One of the most urgent tasks of this decade is the creation of an international regime for the regulation of trade on an suitable basis and the setting up of an efficient financing system for development and trade.The development of peace and stability in the world depends largely on the eradication of poverty and mass starvation. The widening gap between the rich and poor must be bridged. The economic disparity existing between developed and developing countries makes the establishment of the new international economic order a compelling necessity. From the standpoint of international solidarity there is no justification whatsoever for the continuation of the present order  which is characterized by injustice and gross inequities."
"84",4270,"LUX",41,1986,"I take great pleasure in joining previous speakers and warmly congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. I wish you all success in carrying out your functions.I should also like to thank the outgoing President  Ambassador de Pinies  for guiding the work of the commemorative session of the fortieth anniversary and the special session on the critical economic situation in Africa with the competence and dynamism we have long known.I wish also to emphasize the tireless work of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and the importance of the difficult task he is carrying out  with a great deal of dedication  in the service of the international community. The report he has just submitted on the work of the Organization is significant in this regard. I should like to assure him of the confidence and esteem his efforts continue to enjoy with the Government and the people of Luxembourg.The opportunity offered each country to speak freely from this rostrum should not be understood as a simple stylistic exercise or a ritual. The annual meeting in New York  which brings together  in this extraordinary city  officials from all nations the world over  should be perceived as a major event. It is the illustration  and I would even say the living demonstration  of the fact that this planet is one despite its great diversity of civilizations  cultures  races and regimes.Hence  it is essential and vital for all of us that this forum for all nations  large and small - some with a long existence but the majority still quite young - take into account the interests and concerns of all men and women who make up an indissoluble whole. In the past  problems could be apprehended separately  but all are now intricately linked to the point whore they have become our common concerns. Conflicts among nations involve cannon dangers  to which all States represented in our Organization are called upon to bring peaceful solutions.Happily  at its session last year the General Assembly decided to proclaim the year 1S86 the International Year of Peace.It is more urgent and necessary than ewer before to counter the dangers inherent in local conflicts and to face up to the effects of hotbeds of tension is more Important than ever.In accordance with the wish of the Secretary-General  my Government will soon commemorate  on a historic date - 11 November  the anniversary of the end of this century's first world conflagration - the International Year of Peace. This will use the east diverse means to heighten public awareness of the vital need to maintain peace. These activities will be based on a widespread information campaign involving both the newspaper and broadcasting media  non-governmental organizations and teaching institutions.My intention today is not to present a detailed account of ray Government's position regarding the many subjects on the agenda of the forty-first session of the General Assembly  a week ago the Assembly heard my colleague  Sir Geoffrey Howe  on behalf of the 12 States members of the European Community  voice our concerns. I would add that we are in full agreement with the ideas that he developed on behalf of that European Community  to which we are dedicated. I shall thus confine myself to delivering a message on behalf of my Government to all those who do us the honor of listening to us today.In order to be perfectly clear  I must say at once that the men and women of Luxembourg  who have the rare privilege of benefiting from an exceptionally high standard of living  are concerned. They are concerned for several reasons in a world perplexed by the innumerable challenges it faces.While it is generally acknowledged that peace and the survival of mankind cannot be assured without an organization of a universal character  the continuance of what is commonly called the United Nations system is endangered by the lack of whole-hearted political and economic support from its Members.We note with regret growing disenchantment with the co-operation represented by the United Nations. This is particularly tragic since that mistrust in regard to the Organization is being expressed while the solemn professions of faith made on the fortieth anniversary of the Charter are still echoing in our ears. The expression of that step backwards with regard to the united Nations has recently been reflected in the failure of certain Member States to pay their contributions to the budget of the Organization.It would seem that this financial crisis is political in nature and must be treated as such. It reveals profound disagreement between Mentor States as to the role that should be played by the Organization and even by some of its specialized agencies.I must say in this context that it seems to me to be crucial that all States Members meet the international commitments to which they have solemnly subscribed. On the other hand  it cannot be denied that after 40 years of existence we must review all the United Nations programs in order to redirect them towards spheres in which their effectiveness is not called into question and they can tackle matters of real priority  some of which are tragic in nature.In this spirit  my country will join in any effort aimed at restructuring the Secretariat and rationalizing the use and cost of its human resources. Since the situation is still alarming  despite the economy measures adopted at the Secretary-General's initiative  this matter remains extremely urgent. Oily in this way can we create an atmosphere favorable to the restoration of confidence in the future of the United Nations.In addition to the financial crisis  we are concerned by the flagrant disregard  after 40 years of existence by our Organization  of the principles of the Charter  and even of the decisions the United Nations has had to take when intervening actively in conflicts.It will surprise no one if from among those principles X give pride of place to those concerning human rights. The fact that the question of human rights has become a subject of general concern internationally is in our view an undeniable success for the United Nations. We vigorously oppose the maneuvers of those who  on the pretext of budgetary difficulties  try to curtail the Organization's activities in this area.Respect for these rights cannot be subjected to pre-conditions. This is particularly true of certain so-called collective rights  the definition of which remains ambiguous.I wish to pay a particular tribute to those who  in many countries and often in heroic circumstances  have laid themselves open to criminal and other types of prosecution simply because they have claimed the rights explicitly recognized to then in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the instruments and covenants connected with it  such as freedom of expression  freedom of the press and freedom of assembly or association  including trade union rights.However  those principles are barely respected and even openly flouted in many States  for instance  in the countries of Eastern Europe  whose peoples have for over 40 years been in the grip of a single  dominant ideology; in Chile  where the military authority has recently claimed the sad privilege of commemorating the thirteenth anniversary of its seizure of power? or in South Africa  where the apartheid regime  repeatedly denounced from this rostrum  continues to constitute  in my view  the greatest disgrace to mankind as this twentieth century draws to its close.We are particularly concerned about the prospects for the future of South Africa  which is already on the brink of civil war. As the Assembly knows  we will join in any form of collective  binding pressure to bring about the end of this morally and politically unacceptable system.With regard to respect for decisions the united Nations  I wish to pay a special tribute to all those Governments that have made troops available to the united Nations for peace-keeping purposes. We all know what risk those troops face  working under difficult conditions and with necessarily limited possibilities. It is essential that the international community act in solidarity when tiie fate of those forces is at stake.A short time ago I was able to visit both Cyprus and Israel. No one can doubt that without the United Nations peace-keeping forces there would inevitably be a renewal of hostilities in those two areas of the world. The countries that have accepted those troops in their territories and those whose troops are in daily contact with the peace-keeping forces have an obligation to help them to carry out the delicate missions entrusted to them.Our third cause for concern is undoubtedly connected with a phenomenon that is taking on tragic dimensions - that is  terrorism. I associate myself with the words recently spoken by the Head of a friendly neighboring Government  who called terrorism the ""new leprosy"". The constant threat of blackmail  the taking of hostages and the murder of innocent victims  all such wanton violence  must be resisted with the utmost determination.I am convinced that we shall not eradicate this scourge if we remain passive and without complete and unreserved international co-operation. It must be recognized by all States that those that attack defenseless individuals or seek to sow confusion and anarchy within sovereign States deserve neither refuge nor leniency  no matter what the cause that serves as a pretext for their action.I turn now to regional conflicts. We must note that efforts to end these have made hardly any progress in the past year  whether with regard to the pitiless invasion of  Afghanistan by a great foreign Power  the conflict between Iran and Iraq - the bloodiest since the cessation of hostilities in 1945 - or the continued occupation of a part of the island of Cyprus by a foreign force. All these acts are being perpetrated in spite of the most elementary norms of the sovereignty of all States.With regard to the continued impasse in the peace process in the Middle East  I appeal to this Organization to make it possible to establish an international forum in which all parties concerned would participate. That forum might be coincident with  and could facilitate  the beginning of real negotiations aimed  on the one hand  at the recognition of Israel within secure and guaranteed borders and  on the other hand  at permitting the Palestinian people to exercise their right to decide freely upon their own future.In this sad listing I cannot fail to mention the tragic fate still experienced by the Cambodian people  a people whose wish to live in harmony with its neighbors cannot be doubted. I must mention too the continued  unacceptable absence of any representative of the Korean people in this body  which claims to be universal.We view with concern the fact that the situation in Central America has been adrift  after the hopes to which the peace initiatives of the Contadora Group had given rise. We are concerned to note that a major reversal has taken place in the establishment of democratic institutions and dialog in Nicaragua. We are convinced that foreign intervention  whatever its source and whoever its possible beneficiaries  is unlikely to foster a peaceful and democratic solution of the problems there. The only possible road is that of the Contadora initiative; along with our partners in the European Community we shall continue to support it.It is only natural that  being on the border line in Bast-West relations  Europe should watch with interest developments in the current disarmament talks. Great hopes were born towards the end of last year after the Geneva meeting between the leaders of the two super-Powers; repeated appeals  and proposals concerning all kinds of weapons have been put forward since  by both sides. We must however note that despite all those discussions - concerning nuclear  conventional and chemical and biological weapons  and a halt to nuclear tests - the establishment of a true climate of mutual trust which is indispensable to overcoming the differences separating East and west  remains fragile because they are subject to unforeseen events.It is at the negotiating table that we must see true progress. The very encouraging results of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe hold promise for the future.My Government continues to advocate the continuation of this dialog and the establishment of a balance of forces at the lowest possible level  with respect for the security of every State. Following the success at Stockholm  we hope that the negotiations  now at an important turning-point  will not be deadlocked once again  either in forums of which we are fully fledged members  such as the mutual and balanced force reductions negotiations in Vienna  or others of crucial importance for our security.Turning to the General Assembly  I deplore its adoption of an excessive number of resolutions which are most often repetitive. In the field of disarmament  such resolutions - and I certainly do not wish to blame their sponsors - have by and large a very limited impact on the process of dStente. When their content is controversial  all they do is place on record during the debates to which they give rise the existing disagreements  without having any influence on progress at the negotiating table.In sum  what Luxembourg is suggesting is less paper  fewer resolutions  but rather the implementation of the Charter - of the entire Charter.Our concerns go beyond political problems in the strict sense of the term.While the world economy appears to be emerging from a sort of paralysis from which it had been suffering for some time  and while it appears that the phenomenon of inflation has been curbed and that a modest recovery is talking place  there remain serious structural- imbalances calling for adaptation and sometimes dramatic readjustments. That is particularly true for Africa and Latin America. In this context  we deplore the lack of effective economic co-operation in the relevant United Nations bodies. As before  what the third world needs is fewer words and more action.The recent special session on the critical economic situation in Africa  it is true  made some progress possible in this regard. Our determination to achieve the recovery and development of that continent  which lies to the south of Europe and whose fate is particularly dear to us  calls for rapid joint efforts both by the African countries and by the rest of the world.In general we in the industrialized world know that we must undertake new multilateral negotiations  in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  or in international monetary bodies  with a view to redressing the present imbalances  which have had a disruptive effect on the world economy. The problem of indebtedness  which many speakers have already addressed  is a source of real concern to my country as well  inasmuch as threats to prosperity give rise to instability and to threats to world peace.I wish to share the distress of my country and its people at the rapid technological progress which has been threatening the quality of life for future generations. Especially since the very serious nuclear accident at Chernobyl  we have considered that environmental protection can no longer be considered a trite subject for cocktail-party conversation. On the contrary  the many questions that have arisen out of that tragic event reflect the deep-seated concern of our peoples.Soon a nuclear plant will be operating on our borders  with a maximum capacity hardly matched in the world; this gives rise to understandable anxiety among most of ray compatriots. We shall  of course  attempt to protect ourselves against all the possible risks of accident which are inherent in such an installation. But it is undeniable that if there should be a serious accident our entire population would be affected  and my Government is therefore particularly interested in the establishment and strengthening  on the international level  of binding safety standards and procedures for rapid dissemination of information and quick alert.The current efforts in the International Atomic Energy Agency to establish international standards acceptable to all producers and users of nuclear energy have the full support of my Government. Yet I must state that at present my Government has the most serious reservations concerning the lack of acknowledgment of responsibility on the part of producer States towards their non-producer neighbors  and the lack of formal  unequivocal stipulations concerning compensation in the event of catastrophe.My Government will continue to act in this sphere  for this is an essential  vital question for my country and its people; we think in particular of the unfortunate consequences the Chernobyl accident continues to have for all the neighbors of the USSR.As I indicated at the beginning of my statement  it was not sty intention to give a detailed analysis of the overall problems facing the community of nations. I intended to confine myself to stating before this honorable gathering that at the heart of Europe  in a small country that has been independent for almost 150 years  concern still remains  in spite of the apparent security we have experienced.In the face of a troubled and uncertain world  I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to reaffirm the vital role which the United Nations should continue to play in the future. Justice and progress for all people remain our permanent objectives. I reaffirm most vigorously our dedication to the continuation of the United Nations system. For indeed  is not this Organization the only body that provides a place for dialog that might prevent conflicts from turning into open confrontations? It is on that basis therefore that the peaceful settlement of disputes  in accordance with the principles of the Charter and other standards of international law might in fact be found.Aware of our collective responsibility  which no one can escape  let us give new life to this truly world-wide Organization. Let us turn the United Nations into an even more effective instrument  more in conformity with its ideals. In acting this way  let us be inspired by the realism which Winston Churchill showed one day when he stated: (spoke in English)""The United Nations were not created to take us to heaven but to save us from hell."""
"85",4343,"MAR",41,1986,"I should like  first of all  on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco  to extend to Ambassador Choudhury our sincere congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly. We are convinced that his eminent qualities as a statesman  together with his great experience in international affairs  are the best guarantee of the success of this important session. We are particularly satisfied at seeing him preside over our work because brotherly ties and many affinities link his country  Bangladesh  with the Kingdom of Morocco.I also take this opportunity to express to his predecessor. Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  our deep satisfaction with the remarkable way in which he fulfilled the mandate we entrusted to him at the opening of the previous session. Once again he provided proof of his exceptional skill and his great faith in our Organization.* We wish to reiterate to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our profound esteem and our appreciation of his tireless and persistent efforts in the past five years to enable our Organization fully to shoulder its responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the attainment of a better world characterized by stability and co-operation between all States. Since his election as Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar has continually sought  with courage and selflessness  to strengthen the role of the United Nations  by his many initiatives and by suggesting measures which could give the United Nations the means to react more effectively  to both threatened and actual armed conflicts.We hope that the Secretary-General will accept  at the end of his first term  the assurance of our trust and our gratitude for his services to the community of nations. He may be sure that we shall continue to extend our co-operation to him.The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations provided us last year with an opportunity to take stock of the achievements of our Organization and analyse the shortcomings and flaws which prevent it from attaining the goals and objectives we have set ourselves. It is encouraging that we have unanimously reaffirmed the continuing validity of the principles of the Charter and clearly asserted our desire to promote the strengthening of our institution to enable it to respond better in future to the requirements of our time.To this end  the General Assembly has devoted great-attention to the question of improving the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of our Organization. Thus  we have expressed our collective belief that the United Nations would be better able to make its contribution to solving the many problems disrupting our world if its structures and methods of work were rationalized and its financial situation definitively improved. The Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts set up for this purpose has just submitted detailed recommendations  which deserve our careful consideration  with the need to strengthen confidence in the United Nations uppermost in our minds.The Moroccan delegation  foe its part  is eager to make its full contribution towards the adoption of rational  objective decisions which will increase the efficiency of the Organization and its ability to cope with the political  economic and social problems for which it is responsible.We have unanimously proclaimed the year 1986 the International Year of Peace. We have thus shown our determination to initiate Fresh ideas and action in favor of peace  which remains the primary objective of our Organization. In proclaiming an International Year of Peace  we were guided by the conviction that the promotion of international peace and security requires a commitment on the part of all States to resolute action on non-recourse to the use of force  the peaceful settlement of disputes  non-intervention  disarmament  decolonization  respect for the principle of self-determination  and the elimination of all forms of discrimination. The promotion of peace also requires a collective and sustained effort in favor of development.Of course  many demonstrations have been held throughout the world which have helped to increase public awareness of the urgent need to think and to act in a systematic and innovative way with a view to achieving the goals of the United Nations. However  it must be noted that the international scene continues  as in the past  to present a disturbing image because of the persistence of many flash-points of tension  the exacerbation of certain conflicts  the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor nations and the continuation of the uncontrolled arms race.In southern Africa one of the most explosive situations continues to confront the international community. Pursuing its reactionary and anachronistic policy  the Pretoria regime is maintaining and stepping up its oppression of the people of South Africa. Despite all the initiatives taken to bring about the advent of a democratic multiracial society  the Government of South Africa is continuing to strengthen the shameless system of apartheid. Its proclamation of the state of emergency and its long list of crimes and violations of the most fundamental rightsof the human person provide  once again  proof of the intransigence of the Pretoria regime and its refusal to respond to the general indignation aroused throughout the world by its policy of racial discrimination.Turning its back on the inevitable course of history and the most sacred values of civilization  the South African regime has opted for an adventurous policy of headlong onslaught and is engaged in repeated acts of aggression against its front-line neighbors  thereby sowing the seeds of a general conflagration in southern Africa.Supporting the people of South Africa and the other peoples of that part of our continent  the Kingdom of Morocco will continue to provide them  as in the past  with unreserved assistance in their struggle against the apartheid regime.Universal awareness of the seriousness of the situation prevailing in southern Africa and the dangers inherent in it has led to the rallying of the entire international community around the idea of imposing sanctions on South Africa. We express the hope that our Assembly will be able during this session to decide on appropriate sanctions to compel the Government of South Africa to respect the rule of the majority and the fundamental rights of the human person.Eight years have elapsed since the Security Council adopted resolution 435 (1978)  which established a plan for the peaceful and democratic settlement of the Namibian problem. Here again  the Pretoria regime has contrived to erect obstacles to prevent the implementation of the United Nations plan which was to lead Namibia to independence. The Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its unreserved support for our Namibian brothers and calls upon the international community to redouble its efforts to hasten the liberation of Namibia from South Africa's illegal occupation.For 40 years the Middle Bast has been the theater of bloody conflicts seriously endangering international peace and security. However  that region  the cradle of the revealed religions and the part of the world where civilization has flourished from time immemorial  has always been a land of coexistence among all the children of Abraham. Jews and Arabs have lived there on perfectly good terms  contributing through their common genius to the enrichment and flourishing of the heritage of human civilization. This model of harmonious relations between Jews and Arabs prevailed for centuries  throughout the Arab-Islamic world. I n Morocco particularly  this coexistence was strengthened over the centuries and has been maintained intact to this day  with tolerance and respect for the differences between Jews and Muslims in Morocco  bound by their common commitment to being Moroccan and to the sacred values of the nation.Thus we can only deplore the fact that the tragedy created in the Middle East over the past 40 years and the vicissitudes experienced in the region in that time have exacerbated the antagonisms to the point where people have come to believe that any coexistence between Jews and Arabs is out of the question. However  an effort of imagination should make it possible to overcome existing obstacles and to lead to a return to the original harmony which formerly permitted the children of Abraham to contribute together to the building of one of the most brilliant civilizations of the Mediterranean world.For this to happen  Israel must come to its senses and realize that its own interests impel it to put an end to its intransigent attitude  which undermines the path to peace. It is undeniable that this objective can be attained only if Israel recognizes all the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  in particular its right to return to its homeland and its right to the establishment of its own State.It is also undeniable that the establishment of peace requires withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories. The solution of the tragic problem of the Middle East would enable the peoples of the region to recover the spirit of understanding and the foundations of their ancestral symbiosis  a source of progress and renewed prosperity in that part of the world. This vision of the future is embodied in the Arab peace plan adopted unanimously at Fez in 1982  which established the most appropriate principles for a just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.Hence we regret that this realistic and constructive step  which has met with broad approval  has so far  unfortunately  been blocked by Israel.We consider that it is the duty of the international community to pursue its efforts to bring about an age of peace in that part of the world. To achieve this  several formulas have been put forward in search of a comprehensive solution for the Israeli-Arab problem. Reference has been made to an international conference or a preparatory committee  as well as the possibility of an international forum. As far as we are concerned  we believe that pragmatism and realism should guide us in our quest for peace and stability in that troubled region. Any solution which has the support of the-parties and the principal Powers concerned will enjoy our full support.We feel that an international conference bringing together the countries concerned  the Palestine Liberation Organization  which as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people is alone able to make the necessary commitments  and also the Powers with vital interests in the region and world responsibilities would constitute an appropriate forum for the search for and implementation of a comprehensive peace plan for the Middle East.Morocco and Lebanon are linked by so many ties and affinities. We share with that brother Arab country common roots in history and the same commitment to the values of democracy and respect for fundamental freedoms. Therefore we must reiterate once again our grave concern at the tragic situation and upheaval that have prevailed in Lebanon for a decade. The tragedy experienced by this brother country is exacerbated by foreign interference and the presence of foreign troops.We are convinced that the Lebanese people are capable of finding a solution to their problems within a national framework that they are capable of recovering their cohesion and unity  provided that an end is put to all occupation of the territory by foreign armed forces.The continuation of the fratricidal war between two members of our Organization  Iraq and Iran  is a matter of grave source to us. That conflict  which has lasted all too long  has already cost considerable loss of life and threatens at any time to spread its destruction to the entire Gulf region. Nevertheless  there has been no lack of attempts at mediation to put an end to it. The United Nations  the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries have endeavored to convince the two warring parties of the need for an immediate end to hostilities and for a peaceful settlement to their dispute. We must acknowledge that Iraq has shown its good will and has agreed on many occasions to commit itself to a process of negotiated settlement. We hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will finally heed the many appeals made to it. Wisdom  the voice of reason and the enlightened self-interest of all peoples in the region so require.The denial to some countries of their right to choose freely their political  economic and social system manifested in outside interference and foreign occupation  is yet another source of tension in international relations.The Kingdom of Morocco- which stalwartly defends full respect for independence  territorial integrity and the sovereign equality of States  makes an urgent appeal for the evacuation of foreign troops from Afghanistan so that that country say regain its original role as a non-aligned  free and sovereign country. The efforts of the Secretary-General of our Organization to bring about a peaceful settlement of that problem deserve our encouragement and support.My country deeply deplores the continued occupation of the territory of Democratic Kampuchea. We remain convinced of the need for the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops so as to allow for a peaceful settlement of that problem and for the establishment of a lasting peace in South-Bast Asia.External interference has also seriously disturbed stability in Central America. Morocco hails the efforts of the countries concerned to establish regional joint efforts and eliminate interference in their internal affairs. It is incumbent upon the international community to support and encourage the efforts of the Contadora Group to set up the machinery for a peaceful solution  based on respect for national sovereignty and for the territorial integrity of all States in the region.As regards what has come to be called the Question of the Western Sahara  my delegation has on many occasions in the past 10 years presented to this Assembly the various aspects of that problem. I should like  however  to recall the most recent developments in that issue  and more specifically  the peace initiative undertaken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. For indeed the Kingdom of Morocco  like all the other parties concerned  received a letter  dated 20 March 1986  in which Mr. Perez de Cuellar proposed: ""to begin in New York mi 9 April 1986  under his own auspices and with the presence of the personal representative of His Excellency Mr. Abc'ou Diouf  President of Senegal and current President of the Organization of African Unity  negotiations with a view to establishing a cease-t -- re and organizing a referendum in the Western Sahara  pursuant to the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations. It is to be understood that those negotiations will take place separately between the parties to the conflict ""All the parties concerned responded favorably and in writing to this appeal by agreeing to th i framework and to the objective proposed.Consequently  the United Nations began to deal with that problem and on that basis two series of negotiations took place in New York in April and May of 1986 in the Office of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  following which Mr. Perez de Cuellar submitted to the parties a memorandum setting forth precise questions concerning the overall aspects of a referendum. I should like to inform this Assembly that the Kingdom of Morocco has officially and solemnly agreed to the organization of a referendum for self-determination  monitored and safeguarded by the united Nations.The Kingdom of Morocco has therefore participated  and will continue to participate  sincerely and in a constructive spirit  in the process of good offices undertaken by the Secretary-General. His Majesty King Hassan solemnly confirmed to him  during the Secretary-General's visit to Morocco on 15 and 16 July of this year  that that was the case. Morocco believes that this process deserves the support of all peace-loving countries  for it is part and parcel of the basic principles of our Organization  to wit  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the right of peoples to self-determination. We should then encourage the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the current President of the Organization of African Unity to continue their efforts to bring about a just and fined solution to that problem. He hope that solution will lead to harmony and dialog  which have always been inherent in sub-Saharan relations and without which our region will remain prey to upheavals and foreign designs.As a Mediterranean country  bordering on the important maritime navigation route of the Gibraltar Straits  Morocco attaches special importance to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Mediterranean. My country will spare no effort to transform the Mediterranean region into a zone of peace  security and co-operation  free from any tension or confrontation. In our view  co-operation and joint efforts among the countries in the north and those to the south of the Mediterranean are an excellent way to achieve that objective.Over recent years terrorism has continued to wreak havoc the world over. That criminal scourge endangers and destroys innocent human lives. It seriously endangers the fundamental freedoms of the human person and the stability of States. Morocco  which has always opposed all practices contrary to the universal values of human civilization  condemns the use of terrorism whatever its provenance.My delegation welcomes the increased awareness the world over of a need to combat this evil. We would recall in this connection that Arab leaders meeting at the special Summit Meeting in Casablanca in August 1985 vigorously denounced terrorism in all its forms and origins. We are pleased that last year the international community expressed its belief in the need to heighten the awareness of world public opinion as to the dangers of this grave scourge and to increase international co-operation so as to put an end to acts of terrorism and their underlying causes.Since its inception the United Nations has attached great importance to the issue of disarmament. Aware of the close links which exist between security of States  development and disarmament  we have continued to work for the adoption of concrete measures which might put an end to the unbridled arms race.It is regrettable to note that the stockpiling of armaments  already at levels which threaten the very survival of mankind  is increasing  and this only heightens our legitimate concern.The frenetic arms race causes colossal expenditures amounting annually to hundreds of billions of dollars  at a time when two thirds of the world population is living in poverty  squalor and underdevelopment. In this connection  we regret the fact that the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  scheduled for last July  was not held. We note  unfortunately  that the aim of general and complete disarmament under effective international control  which we set for ourselves  is nowhere near achievement.The Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  the only body for multilateral negotiations  is deadlocked and finds itself unable to produce an international instrument on priority questions of disarmament  particularly in the sphere of nuclear disarmament and chemical weapons.Within the framework of bilateral negotiations we are now witnessing an exchange of proposals and counter-proposals on both sides  especially in the sphere of nuclear disarmament.The contacts and meetings which took place recently between representatives of the two major Powers  especially those held in Geneva and Moscow  give us further hope for a forthcoming Soviet-American summit meeting with tangible results in the sphere of disarmament*When we consider the international economic situation we observe that the world is going through a period of great confusion. A cumulative process of long-lasting crisis is developing without any agreement being reached either on the gravity of the symptoms or on the adequate therapeutic means to be applied.Therefore  the objective of the new international order has become a subject of contempt  the Charter of economic rights and duties of States has been opposed; the inter national development strategy disregarded; multilateral co-operation weakened; the very uniqueness of underdevelopment as a typical phenomenon of modern times has been systematically denied. Even though we live in a shrinking and increasingly interdependent world  the major developed countries continue to prefer piecemeal measures to global and lasting solutions.Their trade and technological competition goes hand in hand with the divergence of their monitoring initiatives and budgetary Programs  with the resulting adoption of economic policies incompatible with development requirements.It is widely recognized that the economic crisis is world wide. It is neither a cyclical phenomenon nor mere happenstance but rather the result of deeply rooted structural inadequacies. It is rooted in the close relationship which exists between monetary  financial  trade relations and development prospects. It is characterized especially by the unbearable weight of a growing and virtually irresoluble indebtedness  by the considerable drop in the price of commodities  the grave deterioration in the terms of trade  increased protectionist policies and a reverse transfer of resources.The crisis of external indebtedness  in particular  will not be satisfactorily solved for the developed creditors or the developing debtors and international financial and banking institutions without  first  a massive transfer of resources of all types towards the developing countries} secondly  without a common campaign against protectionism and restrictive business practices; thirdly  without adequate stabilization in commodity markets; and fourthly  without new forms of debt rescheduling and terms and conditions based on growth and the development strategies of the debtor countries.Finally  we must add that the debt crisis cannot be reduced without a new substantial decrease in interest rates in real terms  which in the past decade have reached record figures  and without a stabilization of exchange rates whose excessive fluctuations have been exacerbating the uncertainty of the J or Id economic environment.As long as these questions are not considered in a comprehensive and integrated way  the activities of some will be constantly offset by the reaction of others  without the slightest chance of a renewal of growth  investment and development.The Kingdom of Morocco therefore believes that the Co-ordination of economic policies among developed countries and the compatibility cf such policies with development requirements would be greatly facilitated by the establishment of a multilateral monitoring machinery which would  in a symmetrical and equitable way  find comprehensive and joint solutions to the distressing problem of widespread crisis  growth and development. Despite the crisis of multilateralism  there is no reason for the United Nations  in its work and deliberations being unable to help decide on broad ways and means for the convening of a conference on a reform of the international financial and monetary system which might guarantee the interest of all and more specifically those of the developing world.Prosperity for one region at the expense of another is less and less possible without jeopardizing the foundations of our common future.As for the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly on the Critical Economic Situation in Africa  even though it may be too early to evaluate all of its implications  our feeling remains that a cautious policy of support and vague promises made by the international community were not on a par with our common responsibility  nor with the tragedy of a sorely tried continent. The enormous commitment in concrete  precise terms  which is the African act of faith  has not had an impact on the needs of a continent wallowing in its debts which must face the most serious obstacles at each and every step of its development process. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) predicts that in this region  by the year 2000:""There might be massive and repeated famine; imports of foodstuffs might reduce even the most prosperous African States to bankruptcy and many countries will find themselves at the limit of survival."" At a time when some do not hesitate to call Africa ""the lost continent""  we  on the contrary  would like to hail the courageous efforts made by our continent in its struggle for recovery  development and dignity. Morocco  at any rate  hopes that international commitments will meet African needs  as regards the mobilization of financial resources  the development of technical capacity  the relieving of the external debt burden and its servicing within an appropriate international institution. Our world Organization is the only one in the world where peoples can forge a pact of solidarity to overcome the dangers and tragedies facing mankind.Our differences and the variety of our problems and ideas should not be an obstacle to our living together and to the establishment of true co-operation a song nations. He must draw upon the principles and ideals of the Charter for the materials with which we must build a better  more supportive and more humane world where peace  security and progress for all mankind can prevail."
"86",4475,"MDV",41,1986,"It is indeed a pleasure for me and all the members of my delegation to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. Your unanimous election testified to this body's recognition of your experience and accomplishments in your illustrious diplomatic career. It also constitutes a well deserved tribute to your country  Bangladesh  which demonstrates exemplary courage in overcoming the obstacles to rapid development and modernization. Maldives is especially pleased to see you presiding over this session because of the fraternal relations that exist between our two peoples. Our shared involvement in international and regional co-operation activities and the primary role played by your Government and by you personally in the launching of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) have a special meaning for us. We are confident that you are amply qualified to guide the deliberations of the Assembly to a successful conclusion.My delegation would like also to associate itself with previous speakers who have expressed their admiration for the able manner in which your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jaime de Pinies  discharged his duties as President of the General Assembly at its fortieth session. With his outstandingly rich background in United Nations affairs  the remarkable leadership shown by Ambassador de Pinies surpassed our expectations. His efforts deserve special appreciation.Last year we commemorated the historic fortieth anniversary session of the General Assembly. In their addresses during that session  Heads of State or Government expressed faith in the United Nations. The Organization has reached maturity  and the President of Maldives  addressing that session  explicitly stated our view of the United Nations. We are aware that the United Nations system is not without shortcomings  but we must not fail to recognize its invaluable contributions to mankind.The past year has been an eventful one. But despite efforts to contain the tension and the numerous crises that exist between States the world continues to be volatile and turbulent. It is under these threatening circumstances that we are reminded of the indispensable nature of the United Nations. The Secretary-General's wise and meaningful endeavors to defuse explosive situations are most praiseworthy. His annual report on the work of the Organization reveals the extent of his earnest and sincere efforts to deal with pressing  diverse and complex issues. I am firmly devoted to the idea that the role of the United Nations should be strengthened  and I should like to express our appreciation for his dedication to his tasks. What we require at this crucial time is dedication to the noble principles of the Charter  to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to create conditions conducive to justice  peace and development. The courage to do so is weakened by self-centered political motives  and each passing year compounds existing obstacles  intensifying  among other things  the East-West rivalry  and enlarging the gap between North and South.The report of the Group of 18 High-level Intergovernmental Experts which reviewed the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations has generated a measure of attention and thought. A debate has begun. Maldives believes that the continuation of this process of reflection and reform is essential. We vitally need the United Nations as a strong and constructive force in our increasingly interdependent world. The arms race continues to rage  with some States pouring billions of dollars into their military budgets. So long as a third of the world's population is malnourished and plagued by hunger  disease and ignorance  such wanton expenditure cannot but be vigorously criticized. The Assembly proclaimed 1986 as the International Year of Peace. Yet the year is coming to an and without any practical gains and is sinking into history as nothing more than celebration.The Geneva summit meeting between the two super-Powers in November last year raised our hopes for the revival of detente  but we were forced to abandon them quickly to face increased tension. As a developing State  we cannot help stressing our concern over the lack of progress in the sphere of arms control  disarmament and detente. We welcome the announced agreement between President Reagan and General-Secretary Gorbachev to meet in Reykjavik  Iceland  next week. Maldives hopes that the two leaders will take into account in their negotiations not only their own national interests but also the vital interests of all the peoples of the world. We are encouraged by the outcome of the recently concluded Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. We welcome the forthcoming Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be held in Vienna  which will provide an opportunity to continue along this road in the interests of all.Efforts to protect outer space from the dangers of the arms race should be continued vigorously by the United Nations and through the United Nations. Agreements should be sought and global mechanisms evolved to prevent further proliferation of nuclear weapons. Unless we are able to generate greater political will and assume more shared responsibility on this particular issue now  we fear that our children will be the ones who will suffer the consequences of our own aggressive instincts  which breed nothing but hostility  violence and destruction. In this context  we wish to reiterate that  while we are marking the International Year of Peace  it is important to seek progress in action together with the demonstration of the political will to make our world a safer place.The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions of the world would  we believe  contribute towards international peace and security. The people of any region have an unquestionable right to determine their priorities and work Over the years  the Palestinian problem has spilled over and disastrously affected the security of the entire Middle East. The General Assembly has reiterated that the crux of the Middle East problem is the question of Palestine. Israel  with its military might  continues to exacerbate the crisis by its occupation of more and more Arab territories. It continues to perpetuate its designed policies of expansionism through the establishment of illegal settlements  in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations He strongly condemn such illegal activities  including acts of aggression against the Arabs  and we urge Israel to withdraw all its forces unconditionally from all the occupied Arab territories. My country firmly believes that there cannot be a just and lasting solution to the Palestine question and to the crisis in the Middle East  unless the inalienable rights of the Palentinians are respected and their homeland returned to than. The Palestinians and the Arabs have repeatedly expressed their readiness to resolve the problem on a just and equitable basis. In this context  we support the call to convene an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties concerned. He urge all of them to enter into negotiations with the genuine intention of seeking permanent and durable peace.Maldives would extend its support to all initiatives that would restore to the Palestinians their inalienable right to self-determination  national independence and sovereignty and ensure their return to their homeland. He would likewise support all measures aimed at restoring peace to the war-torn and smoldering region of the Middle East.My delegation is also in favor of all moves that would help to abate the situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea. He support the call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from these countries in order to pave the way for the people of these countries to determine their own affairs and exercise their rights without external interference. We wish to place on record our appreciation of the efforts of the Secretary-General in his relentless attempts to end the warring situation both in Afghanistan and in Kampuchea. We are also pleased to see the willingness expressed by the Kampuchean people in their most recent eight-point proposal outlining a constructive framework for a negotiated settlement. The Charter of our Organization provides ample procedures for dealing with international conflicts. Therefore  any suggestion to involve all parties concerned to seek a national reconciliation would fall entirely within the framework of the United Nations Charter.The Cyprus conflict also has caused untold suffering and misery to its people. This prolonged conflict should be solved urgently with due regard to Cyprus' sovereignty and national integrity. However  we are convinced that such solutions should take into consideration the grievances of both communities on an equal basis. My Government has repeatedly expressed its conviction along similar lines in several other international meetings.It is now a decade and a half since the General Assembly declared the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace within limits to be determined. Pending the agreement on principles and modalities to implement that Declaration  the rising rivalry among the big Powers for politico-economic gains  coupled with commercial jealousies  has virtually turned the Ocean into an area of confrontation. The presence of all types of instruments of war now poses a security threat to all the States  littoral and hinterland  of the region. We reiterate our support to  and urge all States to facilitate the early convening of  the proposed Colombo Conference and express our appreciation of United Nations efforts in this respect.Hopes for the reunification of Korea are still dim  despite the continued efforts of the international community. We reiterate our firm conviction that reunification can be achieved only through peaceful dialog and negotiations between the North and the South. My Government feels strongly that interference by other States in the inter-Korean dispute should cease immediately so as to allow them to reach an amicable agreement that will serve the interests of the Korean people itself.The delegation of Maldives wishes also to stress the importance of reaching a more balanced agreement on Antarctica. The present treaty system which gives special privileges to the consultative parties should consciously be replaced in favor of an equitable arrangement that would recognize Antarctica as a commonheritage of mankind. Antarctica's resources could then be explored and exploited in a way that would benefit all the peoples of the world  with due respect to Antarctica's fragile environment. We feel that the United Nations role should be enhanced in this regard and before the issue drifts out of reach.The world economy is still in a shamble after the recess that set in at the beginning of this decade. The repercussions of that economic downturn are still grim for the developing countries. Although recovery is taking place at the level of the industrialized countries  its results have not been adequately felt throughout the world. The recovery's stability and sustenance still seem to be in doubt  even for the industrialized countries. Retreat by the developed countries from multilateralism and international co-operation in order to resuscitate economic growth has literally squeezed the economies of the rest. If the present trend of recovery is to be sustained with a broader effort by the world as a whole  protectionism needs to be rolled back and concessional capital flow to the developing countries should be increased beyond present levels  not only to enable them to service their debt - which now stands at the trillion-dollar mark - but also to assist them to reach a level of self-reliance. It is indisputable that a healthy growth in third-world economies is crucial and will remain critical to global economic stability.A sign which encourages hope for a change issued from the recent Conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at Punta del Este  and without a doubt has been the most significant event of the year in the field of international trade and economic relations. The importance of the GATT conference lies in the fact that agreement was reached to launch a new general round of trade negotiations to dispel the existing gloom. If the world is to extricate itself from the claws of more economic crises the present unjust structure of the international economic system should be replaced by a new international economic order. The stalled North-South dialog is a clear demonstration of the reluctance of the developed countries to redress the imbalances in the present set-up. In this regard  we welcome the establishment of a non-governmental independent commission of the South for development issues. We are dismayed by the paucity of assistance generated for the least developed countries  despite the Paris Conference and repeated calls for increased contributions. It is also in these circumstances that we feel that South-South co-operation also should be expanded and strengthened.My country belongs to the group of least developed countries. As a small island developing country  the Maldives faces innumerable and formidable economic difficulties and limitations arising from its small size  remoteness from great market center of the world  constraints in transport and communications  highly limited internal markets  scarcity of natural resources  and dependence on a narrow-based economic structure.We note with disappointment that the implementation of the Substantial New Program of Action has been extremely slow and urge those responsible to contribute generously to implement it in the remainder of this decade so that the least developed countries can overcome their difficulties and become self-reliant.My country is endowed with little or no natural resources  except the sea that surrounds the several hundreds of tiny islands. It is this special circumstance of my country and many other small countries that we ask for special attention and assistance. In this regard  we note with satisfaction the steps being taken by the United Nations  specifically by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  to alleviate the problems of island developing countries. We appreciate also the sympathy shown by many other international and regional bodies towards small States and their problems; but sympathy alone will not solve those problems. Bearing in mind those facts  we stress the need for the competent organs of the United Nations system  particularly the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and other financial institutions  to respond urgently to the specific needs of island developing countries.We are proud to belong to this Organization and to participate in its activities. In a world teeming with hotbeds of tension  conflict and bloody wars  where mankind is hostage to the awful nuclear arsenals of its own creation  the importance and indispensability of the United Nations cannot be exaggerated. Our Organization certainly has its problems and difficulties  as can be expected. In the words of my President:""There is no question that it has its problems and difficulties  but with all of them there is ample proof that the world needs the United Nations."" We feel that there is no better institutional arrangement than the United Nations to deal with grievances among States of the world. Our firm belief in the constructive role that the United Nations is playing will not be diminished by its failure on some issues caused by the deliberate and often self-center acts of some States.While we remain convinced of the effective measures that the United Nations continues to take  at the same time we must think of ways and means for further strengthening the Organization and its activities. The valuable services that the United Nations specialized agencies are rendering to mankind cannot be easily described or assessed. As I said in ray statement to the General Assembly in 1984 the United Nations agencies came into existence not only because the prominent men who created them were wise but also because the services that they envisage and render are directly related to the well-being of mankind  irrespective of race  religion or region.In conclusion  let me reiterate my Government's firm and sincere support of the United Nations  for this body has now become the only force on earth that can save human civilization and reverse our drift towards nuclear catastrophe."
"87",4522,"MEX",41,1986,"Allow me to begin  Mr. President  by expressing on behalf of the people and Government of Mexico our profound gratitude to the international community for its prompt and generous assistance following the tragic earthquakes in our country last September. The people of Mexico will never forget such a clear demonstration of world-wide solidarity.I should also like to express our sincere pleasure at your well-deserved election to lead the efforts of the General Assembly  and to make known Mexico's satisfaction at the skillful and effective role played by your predecessor  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  who guided the work of the General Assembly during its fortieth session.I must also acknowledge the tenacious efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who throughout his mandate has shown clear-sightedness and political imagination in confronting the grave challenges of the international situation. His various initiatives are proof of his unshakable commitment to .peace and co-operation between States.My presence before the General Assembly is meant to reassert Mexico's permanent commitment to the United Nations and its ideals. It is a commitment to the rule of law in international relations  the peaceful resolution of disputes and the search for democratic formulas permitting peaceful coexistence and co-operation between peoples  on a just and equitable basis.A little more than four decades ago the hopes of mankind  then emerging from the bloodiest devastation it had ever endured  converged in the creation of a new international organization. Millions of people saw in the United Nations a unique opportunity to build an order among States that would promote progress and universal well-being within a framework of peace and security.The international society of our day would not be the same without the presence of the United Nations. The fortieth anniversary of its founding provided a suitable occasion to take stock of the system.The Organization has undoubtedly helped to deactivate and reduce international crises that might have degenerated into a catastrophe with irreversible consequences. Its promotion of the decolonization progress  which has changed the political map of our time  stands out as one of its fundamental achievements. The growth of a vast system of co-operation and pluralist discussion has led to a common awareness of the great issues that determine the life of nations.Thanks to the formidable development of the multilateral system  we now know that  in spite of geographical  historical  cultural and political differences  we face common challenges that demand the combining of efforts and a new form of solidarity.However  we are still far from attaining the goals of 1945. We now live in a world that is probably more dangerous and unstable  in which the political  military and technical predominance of a few has accentuated the inequality of nations.The lifespan of our Organization has coincided with one of the most dynamic and changing periods in the history of man. Scientific discoveries and thetechnological revolution have transformed societies. Communications link us instantaneously  making us both witnesses of and participants in the most distant events. Today all men are truly modern  unfortunately  this great technical capacity for communication has not always served to further understanding. All too often we know only the appearance of events and not their true significance. Mistrust  prejudice and uncertainty have not yet been banished from our midst.The juridical equality of States was enshrined in the San Francisco Charter  but mechanisms were also established to give the victorious Powers particular responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. In more ways than one the Charter brought together the ideals and pragmatism of a group of nations determined to prevent for ever a universal conflagration. However  some of them did not relinquish their prerogatives and influence.The international community was obliged to yield before the force of circumstances  but that responsibility  as reflected in the rights and obligations of the permanent members of the Security Council  must always be oriented and limited by the international legal order. The attributes of the permanent members are subject to law; they are not privileges without norms or limits. Rivalry -which was accompanied by a division of the world into zones of influence - soon led to confrontation and  as was to be expected  confrontation overstepped the bounds of law and succumbed to the frequent temptation to make indiscriminate use of force.The community of nations  which involves an implied equality of rights and obligations  was distorted by a concentration of power around two main poles. That bipolarity was able to impose its demands: alignment and subordination became a normal part of international life. To be sure  certain periods of extreme tension have been followed by others where a glimmer of understanding was seen. The confrontation to which I am referring - whose true nature and menace is seen in the terrible nuclear arsenals which have been accumulated - has been one of the central problems in international relations during the last four decades.Fortunately  the conflagration which could destroy us all has been so far avoided. Yet we are all subject to a threat the materialization of which would be irreversible. This confrontation has defined many aspects of contemporary life and has left its tragic stamp on the fate of many peoples and regions of the developing world.The evolution of our Organization is a reflection of trends in world politics. The successes and failures  the virtues and deficiencies  of the United Nations are an expression of the degree of commitment of Member States to international law and multi-lateralism.Often  the Organization has been paralyzed by a lack of political will on the part of some States  the very ones which  from the beginning  were entrusted with a primary responsibility for the settlement of disputes. Those States have preferred to create their own security systems  which  aside from undermining the main task of the united Nations in the maintenance of peace  have buttressed the existence of zones of hegemony.The indiscriminate use of the right of veto has all too frequently kept the Security Council from fully achieving its aims  and has prevented that important body from speaking out on events and conflicts that threaten international peace and security.At the same time we cannot deny that the multilateral system has faced clear difficulties over the past several years  some structural and some political. The extraordinary growth of the Organization in recent years has complicated its operation; its effectiveness has therefore been decreased. There is no doubt that strengthening the Organization requires changes to streamline its activities and  above all  to facilitate implementation. That would enable us to restore its legitimacy  and even  for some  its credibility.To the Organization's administrative difficulties have now been added the financial problems which are largely the result of the failure of several Member States to pay their assessed contributions. The international community trusts that the ad hoc Group of 18 experts will be of assistance in overcoming these problems. In any event  the international community knows full well that our contributions to the United Nations are a legal obligation that no one can repudiate unilaterally.The increasing disregard for the norms of international law and the continued unjustified use of force are particularly serious symptoms of the current situation of the community of States. Our Organization cannot and must not be seen as an annoying obstacle to hegemonic aspirations but rather as the only civilized possibility for coexistence in our time. The essential conditions for transforming the international order for the benefit of all are: the improvement of institutions; effectiveness in reaching goals; complete respect for principles; and the genuine political will to strengthen the United Nations system for the benefit of all.The restoration of confidence is incompatible with exclusivist views of the international scene and with definitions of that scene as an arena for political struggle for the defense of individual interests. The voice of the majority cannot be ignored in this forum. Disregard for its will ignores our characteristic diversity and eliminates precious possibilities for genuine  pluralistic coexistence.It is our fate all to live on the same planet  and it is our joint responsibility to make that planet habitable for all peoples  avoiding fruitless friction and erosion  which bear upon the weakest. Harmonious coexistence and civilization can prevail only if based upon respect for the rights of others and upon joining efforts to solve problems of universal interest.The grave economic and financial crisis of our time is an expression of unsolved structural problems in the international order. This crisis poses a serious threat to stability in relations among States and affects the social and political peace of all peoples.Unfortunately  the standstill in global negotiations  which are of vital importance to our development  has exacerbated recession and impoverishment. We have repeatedly pointed to a profound unfairness in trade between industrialized and developing nations  and have demanded that the costs of growth be shared more equitably between rich and poor countries.Obviously  the effort to achieve growth is a major responsibility of our societies. We recognize that much remains to be done  much remains to be improved to that end. But our internal efforts will be unavailing if the world economic climate is unfavorable to us. The problems of Africa  Asia and Latin America also involve the developed economies which have often imposed upon us conditions which are disadvantageous for productive development  technology transfers  and the marketing of our exports  not to mention the financial drain suffered by our economies. Our countries have contributed to the well-being and even on occasion to the extravagance of the more advanced countries. It is time for the more powerful to see the historical fact that their own future and security depend also on their being flexible with regard to the demands of the weaker  and by making genuine contributions to their development and thus to the common good.An appeal for joint responsibility in solving the different aspects of the crisis does not mean attributing blame but rather calling on all nations to assume their commitments so as to face together what no nation can solve by itself.The search for options must take into account the close relationship between debt  trade and currency. We know that a good part of our financial difficulties derives from the enormous burden of servicing foreign debt. We need both the restructuring of the existing debt and fresh resources  but we are also convinced that the reduction of real interest rates to past levels is urgently needed and would offer equitable alternatives that would benefit the entire international financial system. We must not forget that current levels have generated substantial profits for the international banks.Solution of the crisis implies an improvement in the terms of exchange. It further requires  without a doubt  the elimination of protectionism and better prices for our commodities. From this perspective I should like to emphasize the importance of the new round of trade negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the need for oil producers and consumers to resume talks with a view to establishing the market. In such cases communication among the parties involved is an irreplaceable means of furthering the common good.Greater international co-operation and adequate financial flows are also necessary in order for our countries to develop without becoming indebted and in order to break the vicious cycle of need that condemns us to poverty.Mexico has been particularly scrupulous in dealing prudently with its financial difficulties. Thus far we have respected our international commitments thanks to a tremendous effort on the part of our people  whose standard of living has  as a result  been negatively affected. Though we have recently achieved important agreements with regard to managing the foreign debt that will allow formoderate growth over the next two years  we are aware that such agreements are temporary and perhaps insufficient. That will hold true as long as we do not find long-term political and economic solutions of universal scope.The problems of energy  trade  productivity  finance and indebtedness that we all face require global and mutually acceptable solutions; otherwise the world economy will remain subjected to the tragic cycle of recession and recovery  which has not been unrelated to the political instability and the conflicts affecting various parts of the world.In calling attention to this situation  Mexico expresses its full solidarity with the developing peoples that are struggling for a more just and balanced international economic order. We will spare no effort on their behalf in the search for just and realistic solutions through negotiations. We betray neither our sovereignty nor our historical positions in seeking  with flexibility and responsibility  agreements that further our legitimate interests.Bipolar confrontation and the intensification of regional conflicts  added to the arms race  have been jeopardizing world peace and security since the beginning of this decade. We are encouraged by the possibility of detente between the great Powers that is being renewed after a period of estrangement and uncertainty.We hope that negotiation and dialog will reduce tensions. That is why we express our wish that a renewal of contacts between those Powers  at the highest level if necessary  will lead to permanent agreements  providing us all with genuine security. We hope that this possibility will soon become fact.We must not forget  however  that there are many other issues besides this question  so critical in our time  which do not fit into the framework of the East-West relationship. North and South must redefine the structure of their relations. Beyond any prevailing tendencies  today's world presents a diversitythat does not; permit of rigid or simple viewpoints. East and West  North and South offer a plurality of ways of life that constitutes the true wealth of today's community of nations.Every nation impresses upon its foreign policy traits derived from its own historical experience and can express in this forum  frame of pressure and in complete independence  its views on the international situation and the reasons for whatever initiatives it promotes. This is the highest virtue of the democratic spirit of our Organization. All voices must be heard arid considered  for political astuteness is not necessarily on the side of economic or military power.In its active participation in international forums  Mexico always seeks to be constructive. We do not come here to oppose anybody  or to vote for or against anybody  but to maintain and strengthen principles expressly accepted by the international community. Our political tradition and the cordial relations we try to maintain with all the countries of the world are rooted in our unbending conviction that the power of law is greater than the power of force. Thus we have participated in actions that contribute to the reduction of international tension and to the solution of regional problems. We have raised our voice in negotiations between the industrialized and the developing worlds. We have also made clear our commitment to the processes of decolonization  and we demand respect for human rights wherever they are violated.At the same time  historical experience forces us  faithfully and constantly  to defend the principles of non-intervention and the self-determination of peoples and to stand with conviction for the peaceful settlement of disputes and international co-operation. For the same reasons we are unwaveringly opposed to the undue use of force and to the threat of its use. Mexico maintains that full Mexico has associated itself with various proposals for nuclear disarmament  both on the regional and on the universal level. Yesterday  along with other Latin American coin tries  we helped to bring about the Treaty of Tlatelolco. Today  we participate actively in the multilateral organization. devoted to disarmament. Our role in the Group of the Five Continents  together with the Heads of State and Government of Argentina  Greece  India  Sweden and Tanzania  fully substantiates Mexico's peace-loving position and its adamant will that we all be freed from the nightmare of a possible nuclear conflagration that would yield neither victors nor vanquished and would reduce several millennia of civilization to radioactive dust within a matter of seconds  making life itself disappear.In the Declarations that we have signed  first at New Delhi in 1985 and just last month in the Mexican city of Ixtapa  we have stated that it is incumbent upon all men and all peoples  and not just those Governments which possess the technical capacity to wreak total destruction  to make efforts to halt the arms race. We have issued a fervent appeal for world-wide detente and the conclusion of agreements aimed at halting the irrational arms race. We have also called  in both Declarations  for better use of the human and material resources which are now being squandered upon the instruments of death  and for their application to the development of peoples and the satisfaction of their most urgent and vital needs.In the New Delhi Declaration we called upon the super-Powers to suspend nuclear tests  as a first step toward a treaty banning them entirely. We also took a firm stance against the militarization of outer space. In Mexico  we presented specific proposals to verify the suspension of nuclear tests; we insisted upon the dangers inherent in an arms race in outer space; and we reiterated our conviction that dialog among the Powers must lead to the adoption of concrete disarmament accords.Our statements  whose legitimacy flows from the fact that they express the wishes of all mankind  are but the first in a series of efforts that the international Community will have to undertake  in the hope of eradicating nuclear weapons.The great challenge confronting human intelligence as the twentieth century draws to a close is to achieve the convergence of peace  disarmament and development so that  joined at last  they may forge for human society a way of life and a destiny never to be renounced.The prevention of nuclear war is linked to the solution of conflicts affecting the balance of power. In various geographical areas the exercise of force and intolerance hinder chances for conciliation.Similarly  the obduracy of certain States  which insist that we view in terms of the East-West conflict the struggles for self-determination being waged by the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America  retard and restrain-the inevitable triumph of those peoples.In Central America  the or is is is deepening  and the chances for promoting a peaceful solution are often squandered and underestimated. Mexico has spared no effort in the search for just agreements that would respect the legitimate interests of all the Central American States. Thus  together with the Governments of Colombia  Panama and Venezuela and with the active support of Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay  we have encouraged strategies that would lay the foundations for peaceful coexistence and co-operation in the region. We have given detailed reports to the United Nations on the progress of our diplomatic efforts.Allow roe to reiterate once again that Contadora and its Support Group cannot be a substitute for the political responsibility of the Central American Governments. Peace is their decision above all  just as it is the decision of those other States that help determine the course of events because of their presence and influence in the area.We cannot supersede the will of the parties directly involved; but neither can we remain indifferent to situations that not only jeopardize regional stability and our common future but also violate the dignity of the peoples of Latin America and harm our legitimate national interests.One State's disagreement with the political process of another State does not justify  in any circumstance  the perpetration of acts that are outside the bounds of international law. Latin America has undertaken an intense diplomatic effort which cannot be ignored. Several times  as in Caraballeda early this year  the Governments of Latin America have proposed concrete measures aimed at creating an atmosphere favorable to conciliation. These measures are well balanced in regard to the effort required of each party - whether directly or indirectly involved in the process - in order to re-establish the juridical order and facilitate the conclusion of agreements. We are convinced that our viewpoints  enshrined in the Contadora Treaty for Peace  Security and Co-operation in Central America  remain valid in the light of current circumstances.Latin America has opened the doors to dialog and compromise in Central America  as part of the process of negotiation and integration it has decided to promote. Mexico states once again that it is fully willing to contribute to the pacification of the area.We stand for negotiated solutions to conflicts not only in the region which is closest to us but also in other areas  whether in the South Atlantic  southern Africa  the Middle East  the Mediterranean or South-East Asia. We are convinced that  with an imaginative and constructive approach  opportunities for understanding can be found in each of these placesWithin the context of the permanent struggle for decolonization  the case of Namibia deserves special mention. Its illegal occupation by South Africa must not be tolerated by the international community. That Territory's independence is beyond any geopolitical considerations  an it is incumbent upon all Member states of the United Nations to ensure that it is achieved. The immoral behavior of the opprobrious South African regime  with its policy of racial segregation  similarly demands a response from our Organization. We note with interest that the trend towards the imposition on the Pretoria Government of sanctions envisaged in the Charter has received new and important forms of support in the commence of this year.The developing countries have always recognized that the United Nations is an essential part of any effort to promote the democratization of international relations. Apart from constituting the forum best suited to guaranteeing peace and security  it has also been a privileged place in which to discuss the most difficult problems of our time.It is here that the Member States have had an opportunity to examine social and economic affairs that merit a clear and effective response from the international community. Suffice it to recall that in 1987  thanks to an initiative taken by the Secretary-General  there is to be an International Conference on Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking  at which we shall be able to examine objectively that complex criminal process  which involves centers of production as well as consumption.The Organization's ability to respond to the demands and needs of our time has been fully demonstrated. However  we cannot refrain from  insisting that the strengthening of the United Nations system depends primarily on the political will of States to respect the purposes and principles of the Charter. We must improve the Organization and  more important than ever  we must endow it with a new legitimacy based on the lawful behavior of all States. Force and military might cannot be above the law. In our day  civilized life and the security of States depend upon our respect for international norms. If those norms do not prevail  we can hardly aspire to peaceful  stable  just coexistence. The strengthening of our Organization and its effectiveness also depend upon the prevalence of those norms.Because of their interdependence and their difficulty  world problems cannot be solved solely through bilateral channels  or even by a sum of partial and fragmentary agreements. Because of their complexity  they require multilateral solutions that bring together common aspirations and achieve unity in decisions and actions.Just as dialog and detente among the great Powers can no longer be postponed  just as it is necessary to restructure the international economic order so that North and South have equitable shares in its benefits and hardships alike  so must the revitalization of multilateral forums become a priority item on the agenda for the remainder of this century.It is incumbent on the United Nations to play an essential role in building more just and democratic international relations. It is also the role of our Organization to guarantee peaceful and rational coexistence  co-operation and solidarity among peoples. Let us improve it  if necessary and wherever necessary  but for as long as it endures let us recognize that it is perhaps our only and our highest guarantee of security  peace and civilization."
"88",4617,"MLI",41,1986,"﻿It is a great pleasure for me to extend to ambassador Choudiury of Bangladesh  on behalf of the delegation of Mali  our warmest congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. We believe that his talents as an experienced diplomat will enable us to arrive at the wise and perceptive decisionsthat our peoples expect of us. My delegation assures his of our full co-operation and support as he carries out the difficult task entrusted to bin.I should like to extend to Mr. Jaime de Pinies my delegation's appreciation for the tact and devotion with which he presided over the last regular session of the Assembly and for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the work of the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly.I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who is energetically endeavoring to promote the ideals of peace and justice in this world and ensure that the United Nations remains the leading forum for the convergence  conciliation and symbiosis of the interests of all. peoples.At the last session we were worried by the upheavals in the world economy  which affect international relations. Today we have to say that the international climate is still suffering from crises  fear and disarray. The imbalances in the economies of the developing countries continue. Indeed they have even been exacerbated in some parts of the third world  assuming very disturbing dimensions following natural disasters  including drought and desertification  with their tragic consequences for the human population and for cattle. We much appreciated the contribution made by the international community in this emergency situation. Unfortunately  lasting solutions are still uncertain because official development assistance is shrinking and drying up and the external debt is becoming an increasing burden.Since its thirty-ninth session the General Assembly has recognized the gravity of this situation and the need to promote concerted international action to remedy it. It was in that spirit that at its fortieth session it decided to convene a special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. Mali was pleased that that session was held. For the first time the General Assembly gave special attention to the vital needs of one continent. It was because Africa believes in the unity of the destiny of all peoples that it decided to submit the serious problems impeding its development to this important forum of international harmonization. At that session Africa expressed to the international community its desire and willingness to deal responsibly with these problems  toe solution of which is was recognized by all the participants - is to be found basically in promoting the agricultural sector. It was encouraging that the final Declaration approved at that session endorsed the firm resolve of Africa to restructure its economy  and that this was welcomed by the donors  which undertook to support the continent in this undertaking  in particular by contributing to an increase in food production. Fulfillment of the commitments altered into would be the donors response to the requirements of international solidarity and proof of a responsible approach to history.In a world of close and growing interdependence in the economic sphere the reforms that the African countries intend to undertake cannot attain their objectives as long as Africa suffers from the accumulated effects of the deterioration in terms of trade  protectionism and the crushing burden of external deb to External debt has attained a critical threshold in Africa. Negotiations leading to agreement between Africa and its creditors are more necessary than ever before. Because Africa is convinced of the relevance of this approach  it calls for the convening of an international conference to consider this burning issue.Recent years have been marked by the collapse of attempts at dialog between the industrialized and the developing coin tries on some matters of vital interest to the human race. This is true of the global negotiations  which have been marking time for six years now. The future of international economic co-operation  which necessarily involves the establishment of the new inter national economic order  will depend on the ability of the international community to promote those negotiations. If we are to build a better world and provide appropriate solutions to serious economic problems it is essential that multilateral economic co-operation be preserved and strengthened  for it offers one of the promising avenues of our time.The deterioration in international economic relations extends to international political relations. The human race is prey to political crises which create insecurity and mistrust in inter-State relations.The frenetic  massive build-up of nuclear weapons has become a source of fear  anxiety and anguish for mankind: fear because of tensions in the international situation today; anxiety because of the sombre prospects for the future> and anguish because of the traumatic memories being awakened in the collective consciousness by today's nuclear arsenals. Faced with the enormous dangers now facing mankind  Mali supports negotiations on nuclear and space weapons and calls on the nuclear Powers to cultivate among themselves trust and political will  the two prerequisites for successful negotiations. As was said 30 years ago  we have to choose not between peace and war but between life and annihilation.We hope that the profound desire of peoples to live and be happy will shift the gloomy appeal to chaos  that the will to create and maintain moral  social  cultural and economic values will overcome and repulse the forces of destruction  that the curtain of hope will block the window of disaster and apocalypse and temper the desire for conquest of so-called supremacy  which today we can recognize as being outdated and suicidal. We hope that the Reykjavik summit meeting will lead to dialog and echo our deepest aspiration to peace. It is more necessary than ever before for the international community to understand that our world will find in true economic and social development the best possible material  moral and spiritual resources for ensuring peace and security. Unfortunately  the arms race does not promote economic growth  because it reduces productive investment.It is regrettable that the usefulness of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development has not been understood equally by everyone. That Conference should lead the international community to become more aware of the links between the need for security and the need to satisfy the aspirations to well-being of two thirds of the human race. The Head of State of Mali  President Moussa Traore  in this very forum stated very relevantly:""There is no development without peace  just as there is no peace without development. There is no conscience when millions of human beings are dying of thirst  hunger and disease while increasingly lethal and expensive weapons are reinforcing ever more destructive arsenals.""The delegation of Mali takes this opportunity to urge the nuclear Powers to co-operate in ensuring the convening and the success of the Conference.Another very serious threat to peace and international security is the situation in southern Africa. Appeals to reason have not led the racist regime of Pretoria to abandon its inhuman policy of depriving the black majority of its most elementary rights. The racist minority of Pretoria  in its obsession with perpetuating the regime of apartheid  is carrying out acts of aggression and armed provocation against the front-line States. The recent attacks against Zimbabwe  Botswana and Zambia bear witness to the determination of those that practice this odious system of apartheid to continue as long as possible its acts of destabilization and intimidation against neighboring states.The blade people of South Africa  despite the repression imposed by the racist police and army  are expressing with ever greater intensity their determination to free themselves from the net of enslavement and alienation in which they are being kept. This denial of justice and liberty is an insult to the international community. The violent confrontations resulting from it are a serious threat to world peace and security.My delegation trusts that the unanimity recently achieved at the International Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  which called for comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist Pretoria regime  will induce the Security Council to impose the measures provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter.As in South Africa  the racist regime in Namibia is carrying out brutal harassment against an innocent population determined to live in freedom and dignityAlong with acts of repression  the racist Pretoria minority  in its obstinacy in perpetuating the illegal occupation of the Territory of Namibia  is trying to install puppet political institutions that can in no way mislead the international community or detract from the will of the Namibian patriots under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people. As was recalled at the fourteenth special session  the only peaceful path to Namibian independence is full incrementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).In addition to the situation in southern Africa  other hotbeds of tension continue to be of concer to us in Africa.In Western Sahara  my country supports the efforts undertaken jointly by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to find a lasting and acceptable peaceful solution to the problem. The OAU is also in search of a peaceful solution that would preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Chad  and it has the support of my country.In the Middle East  the tragedy of the Palestine people has lasted for more than 40 years. Israel continues to deprive the Palestinian people of their legitimate and inalienable rights. We shall never stop saying that the prerequisite for a solution to the Palestinian problem is recognition of the national rights of the Palestian people and the effective exercise of their rightsunder the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  their sole authentic and legitimate representative. In this connection Mali supports the efforts to organize an international conference on the Middle East.As for the situation in Lebanon  the people of Mali  in solidarity with the people of Lebanon  support initiatives to bring peace back to that country.Mali is also distressed over the continuing war between Iran and Iraq  two Muslim peoples that aspire to live in peace. We would therefore repeat our appeal to those two countries to put an end to their fratricidal war.In Afghanistan and Kampuchea crisis and tens ion persist  threatening peace and security. The Republic of Mali believes that only a negotiated political solution can guarantee an improvement in the situation in those two countries.My country  a member of the Contact Group of the Non-Aligned Movement on Cyprus  would appeal to the Cypriot communities to resume the talks that are undeniably essential to a solution that will safeguard the unity  territorial integrity and non-alignment of that island.In Central America  my country reaffirms its devotion to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and the right of peoples to choose for themselves a political and economic system in keeping with their identities  and we would urge States of the region concerned and interested in this crisis to adhere to the Contadora Agreement for peace and co-operation in Central America.As regards those countries that are divided  the United Nations Charter recognizes the right to seek through negotiation  and without outside interference  a solution that enables them to regain their unity. It is on the basis of that principle that my country supports the independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean nation.The establishment of a true atmosphere of peace in the world will be possible only when countries  in their day to day life  scrupulously abide by the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. We must convince ourselves that peace depends on the will to negotiate and to strengthen mutual trust and collective security  and not on confrontation and violence.Mali  for its part  reaffirms that it will in its relations with other States  and in particular with its immediate neighbors  rigorously abide by negotiation and the principles of good-neighborliness set forth by our Organization.The concern that led to the report of the Group of 18 doubtless reflects an awareness of the international community regarding wastage and an erosion of the credibility of our Organization. It will be a working tool to enhance the effectiveness of this Organization  provided it does not promote the progressive paralysis of the United Nations  provided it does not sidetrack it from its essential task  and provided ""savings"" do not kill all its activities and the United Nations does not depart from its responsibility and its fundamental objectives.The United Nations must continue its work to take up those challenges facing us: the international economic crisis  hunger  disease  ignorance  armed conflicts local and regional  and the arms race. These challenges mean that we must remain active and vigilant so that peace  which will come from order based on justice  can be consolidated and reinforced."
"89",4658,"MLT",41,1986,"On behalf of the delegation of Malta  and on my own behalf  I congratulate the President on his well-deserved election to preside over the General Assembly at its forty-first session. I also extend our heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Jaime de Pinies for the excellent manner in which he guided the Assembly's work at its fortieth session.The system of international relations slowly developed after the Second WorldWar is under increasing strain. The ideal is that of a community of nationsreconciling individual and collective interests through a peaceful process of consultation and co-operation. The reality  however  is the resurgence of arbitrary actions and the use or threat of the use of force as a prime determinant in inter-State relationships. After two dangerous cold wars since the end of the Second World War  a new period of detente is desperately needed.In the United Nations Charter  regional associations are envisaged as basic components of a multilateral system structured around the united Nations. In practice the first two major post-war regional associations soon developed into two competing military concentrations largely outside the orbit of the United Nations system. Other regional associations and groupings have indeed also emerged which  more directly  translate the fundamental objectives of the Charter into concrete Programs of action at the regional level. Progressively  however  the capacity of the United Nations to mold those various initiatives into a coherent system for global peace and security is being eroded.The ongoing financial crisis within the United Nations is but a symptom of a much more deep-rooted malaise.The Mediterranean has long been an arena of events which dramatically illustrate the strains imposed upon the objective of a peaceful multilateral system. Direct confrontation between the two super-Powers is a daily reality in our region. That confrontation has led to a naval-military build-up unique in its scope and potential for trouble. In the Mediterranean the super-Power confrontation is even more direct than it is in Central Europe. There it is at least moderated by the presence and involvement of other members of the two military alliances.The problems of the major trouble-spots in the Mediterranean region  in particular the Middle East  only compound and exacerbate that confrontation and events in the Central Mediterranean over the last 12 months are a clearmanifestation of the dangerous volatility which that confrontation brings to the region. It is in this very specific regional context that Malta has adopted its status of neutrality based on the principles of non-alignment. We have responded to a turbulent regional situation in the only manner which permits us to pursue and safeguard our national security and prosperity while at the same time contributing to the security and development of our region as a whole  as well as to a second detente between the two super-Powers. It is in that sense that Malta's neutrality follows the other successful experiments towards neutrality which have been tried in Europe in the post-war years. The various other neutral States of Europe  strikingly different as they are in their various national experiences  still share one fundamental aspect: • the adoption of the status of neutrality for them constitutes the means whereby they can play a distinct but constructive role in the destiny of their region. Par from being a withdrawal from the state of super-Power confrontation which surrounds them  their status of neutrality permits them to assert their freedom of action in the face of that confrontation.For Malta and the other neutral States of Europe  neutrality does not only carry the traditional commitment towards non-involvement in an eventual conflict: it also carries the additional commitment to an active policy in peacetime directed towards eliminating those factors that could bring about such an eventual conflict. The role of the neutral States of Europe in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a major example of how that commitment can be translated into collective action.At the same time  Malta is also a developing country  sharing common aspirations with the other newly emergent nations of the world. Our strict adherence to the principles of non-alignment therefore makes it clear that our neutrality in the context of the super-Power confrontation in the Mediterranean is by no means a rejection of our solidarity with the rest of the developing world. Malta is indeed deeply committed to the struggles of the peoples of Palestine and southern Africa to achieve freedom and dignity and to the efforts of the peoples of Cyprus  Afghanistan and Kampuchea to rid their territories of foreign troops; to the endeavors by the people of Korea to reunite their divided country; and to the struggle of the people of Nicaragua to resist foreign interference.We are equally committed to the struggle for the creation of new international economic and information orders which would open the way for a more just and equitable partnership between all the peoples of the world. We will invariably stand with all those who work for peace and justice in the face of aggression and oppression. Our voice will never fail to join in the call for more stability  fairness and equity in the relations among peoples and nations.It is just over six years since Malta formally adopted its status of neutrality  based on the principles of non-alignment. The adoption of that status had been preceded by a decade of careful planning and preparation  intended to secure the essential foundation upon which our neutrality could be assured. The Maltese economy was thoroughly restructured  from one geared towards servicing a military base to one dedicated to friendship and co-operation with all States.In the mid-1970s  while still half-way through its process of economic and political transformation  Malta joined the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Its membership of that Movement served as a major encouragement and support to our continuing endeavors  and by March 1979 the last vestiges of a foreign military presence in Malta had been eliminated. The way was completely open for the formal adoption of a status of neutrality by the Government  and its proclamation was eventually incorporated in Malta's Neutrality Agreement with Italy  signed in September 1980 and duly registered with the United Nations in conformity with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations.Malta's status of neutrality reflects the deepest aspirations of the Maltese people for national and regional peace and progress. It is rooted in an increasingly broad-based national consensus. Although originally inspired by the Socialist Government of Malta  which since 1971 has been given three consecutive popular mandates for power by the people of Malta  a parliamentary select committee composed of members of both sides of the House is now considering the proper means of enshrining the status of neutrality in Malta's constitution.Over the last six years  Malta's status of neutrality  based on the principles of non-alignment  has also received the recognition and support of a growing number of regional and other States as well as of international organizations. First Yugoslavia  then Italy  led the way in 1980. Italy was soon joined by its Mediterranean partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) - notably Prance and Greece - in giving recognition and support to a policy which was manifestly aimed at making a significant contribution towards the objective of ensuring greater security and stability in what is the most exposed southern flank Of NATO.The non-aligned States of the Mediterranean region  in particular the North African States of Libya  Tunisia and Algeria  also followed Yugoslavia in extending recognition and support for Malta's neutrality. In removing the possibility of a military base for outside Powers on its territory a neutral Malta not only joined the growing ranks of the non-aligned members but also eliminated one of the traditional focal points of the aggressive armaments build-up in the region  which had in the past also served as a direct threat to the security of non-aligned countries in the Mediterranean region.Two regional organizations which between them incorporate moat of the Mediterranean States - the European Economic Community (EEC) and the Arab League - have played a significant role in giving application to the commitment of their Mediterranean members to extend tangible support for Malta's neutrality. The original association agreement between Malta and the EEC of 1970 has over the years been extended and enlarged to permit this support. Two Protocols on financial assistance  major improvements in market access for Maltese exports and provisions for industrial co-operation have already been agreed upon. The European communities are now examining proposals submitted by Malta's Prime Minister Karmenu Mifsud Bonniei in May of this year for closer political co-operation as a basis for a special relationship which could create conditions favorable for Malta to consider eventual membership.With the Arab League Malta is also engaged in establishing a special relationship aimed at further consolidating the close ties of co-operation Malta already enjoys with all Arab States. Proposals submitted by the Government of Malta to the League's secretary-general earlier this year with this objective in mind should be the object of the League's council's deliberations in the near future.Outside its immediate region  Malta's status of neutrality has enabled it to establish new friendships and to revitalize traditional partnerships on the basis of mutual benefit and respect. With the States of Eastern Europe  with non-aligned countries  with close countries like Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States  and with China  Malta has in fact opened up rewarding economic  political  commercial  cultural and other relationships which are inspired by  and which in turn serve to further consolidate  Malta's status of neutrality.Prom traditional partners in Western Europe Malta has also now received due recognition of and support for its neutrality. The United Kingdom has signified respect for the status adopted by its former colony by making it known  in particular  that it would avoid taking action which could be seen as a challenge to that status. Last year Malta and Britain reached an agreement on the clearing of wartime bombs and wrecks which were obstructing full exploitation of the economic potential of Malta's deep-water Grand Harbor. British navy personnel co-operated with Maltese divers in the clearing operations  and Britain made an important financial contribution this year towards the costs of that operation.That in turn opened the way for a revitalization of the long-standing partnership between Malta and Britain. During 1986 we have had a series of intensive and highly successful contacts which have laid the foundation for the establishment of a durable and mature relationship between our two peoples  free now from any residual irritations from the past. Perhaps the most symbolic of this year's events was the impressive welcome which the Maltese gave to a navy frigate when it called at the Grand Harbor to join in the 15 August celebrations  recalling the remarkable experiences shared by our two peoples during the darkest days of the Second world War.Later in the year Malta was also encouraged to receive a formal announcement by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany of its determination to respect and support our status of neutrality and its recognition that that status was making a significant contribution towards security and co-operation in the Mediterranean.It is evident that Malta's neutrality has now received recognition from a wide range of countries representing members of both major military alliances  as well as a wide cross-section of members of the Non-Aligned Movement. This recognition has also been given by important international organizations  including the Commonwealth  the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Non-Aligned Movement itself.It is important to emphasize in this context that the two super-Powers have also given Malta their own assurances regarding their respect and support for its neutrality. For us this is of particular significance in the light of the fact that we define our neutrality essentially in terms of the super-Power confrontation in Europe and in the Mediterranean  and we further consider it one of the major objectives of our neutral status to help limit and even reverse the manifestations of that confrontation in our region.The Government of Malta has in fact repeatedly made it clear that it seeks the reduction and eventual elimination of all foreign armaments  especially the nuclear armaments of the super-Powers  from the Mediterranean. We aim to use both the moral force arising from our neutral status and the close co-operation for peace which it permits us to establish with the neutral States of Europe and the non-aligned Mediterranean States to create the conditions which would make possible a gradual and evenly scaled withdrawal of the navies of both super-Powers from our region. Central to our approach in this context is the objective of giving a greater role in regional matters to the States of the region themselves. We are determined to work with those States to ensure respect for the principle of non-resort to force in all the problems which arise in the region.Developments in the Mediterranean over the last 12 months have put our endeavors in this direction to a severe test.By the middle of April of this year a spiral of violence and counter-violence had resulted in the bombings of civilian and military targets in Tripoli and Benghazi by the United States. Even in an international environment in which many of the accepted norms of inter-state behavior remain disregarded  those developments were considered as most unusual and disconcerting. An armed attack by one State against another state in the absence of a declaration of war in itself constitutes an unwelcome action fraught with dangerous simplifications for international peace and security. In the case of the April attack on Libya the danger was immeasurably compounded by the fact that the attacking State was one of the two super-Powers. The risk of retaliation by the other super-Power was real and immediate. Furthermore no Mediterranean state could remain undisturbed that armaments brought into the region in the context of blocconfrontation were suddenly being used in an attack against a non-aligned State of the region.An examination of the events which preceded the April bombings reveals not so much a sequence of cause and effect as an erratic and ever widening spiral of violence. Terrorist activities  never absent from our region  had intensified since the previous summer. One recalls the TWA hijacking of June 1985  a grenade attack in Rome in September  the hijacking and landing in Malta of the Egypt Airlines Boeing in November  the attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports in December  and the TWA bombings and the attacks on a Berlin night-club in early April i986.At the beginning of October 1985 Israeli planes attacked the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis. This action was followed about ten days later by the forced interception by United States fighters of an Egyptian airline carrying suspected Palestian hijackers. This incident led to friction between two NATO allies  the United states and Italy  and even to a crisis in the Italian Government coalition.By January there were visible signs of increasing tension between the United states and Libya. United States warships were increasingly deployed in the vicinity of Libya  and the United States President announced severe economic sanctions against Libya and invited his allies to do likewise.In February Israeli aircraft forced a Libyan Arab Airlines aircraft to land in Israel. In March  during naval maneuvers held by the United States Navy in the Gulf of Sidra  there were armed encounters between United States aircraft and Libyan patrol boats and missile sites.The bombings of Tripoli and Benghazi on 15 April were themselves effected by fighter units operating from aircraft carriers cruising off the Libyan coast  in addition to other bombers taking off from bases in Britain. Following the bombing on 15 April two Libyan missiles were fired against the Italian island of Lampedusa  which is only about 100 miles to the south-west of Malta.Behind these events is the untold tragedy of innocent individuals killed or wounded in this erratic violence. They are the immediate and most dramatic victims of a situation which has escaped the constraints of even minimum respect for the norms of international behavior. In a broader perspective  however  the whole international community has fallen victim to these events since they directly threaten the fragile fabric of a rule of law without which regional and global peace and security cannot be preserved.What h as happened in the Mediterranean over the past few months reflects a sense of despair on the part of those directly concerned that peaceful means do not exist through which they can pursue what they consider their fundamental interests. They have therefore arrogated to themselves arbitrary actions and codes of behavior without any consideration of the wider implications of their activities. This is as true of the random acts of individual terrorists as it is of the ostensibly more carefully deliberated acts of States. A vicious circle has  therefore  been created whereby the ineffectiveness of a multilateral system in redressing fundamental grievances breeds actions and counter-actions which further erode the basis upon which that multilateral system can exist.When confronted with this increasingly tense situation.  one option which neutral Malta could not conceivably consider was to stand by passively without taking any action. On the contrary  and in spite of the fact that there were those that acted otherwise  we exerted strenuous efforts to try to persuade all the States directly concerned to adopt measures for the peaceful settlement of disputes as envisaged in the United Nations Charter and avoid all temptations to use or threaten to use force. In the circumstances we conducted our efforts on two levels.At the first level  at which action was most urgent  Malta took an immediate and unequivocal stand in its attitude towards acts of terrorism as well as towards the means which should be adopted in resolving differences among the States involved. Our message to the terrorists was clear and firm. Not only did we condemn their actions  but we took all possible measures from our side to block these actions. We were equally clear and firm in our message to the contending States. dialog  not the use or threat of use of force  was the means for resolving difference. In order to bring about a dialog among those directly concerned  Malta's Prime Minister  Karmenu Misfud Bonnici  personally traveled to Libya and Italy  held extensive consultations in Malta 2nd kept all parties fully informed of all his initiatives throughout the months from January to April. It is a stark reminder of the extent of our efforts  as well as of the lack of response by some parties  that Libya's Prime Minister was in Malta consulting with Prime Minister Misfud Bonnici  former Prime Minister Mintoff and myself on ways and means of organizing the dialog only eight hours before Tripoli and Benghazi were attacked.At the second level  from the earliest days of January Malta sought to bring into application whatever processes and procedures were available at both the international and the regional level to intercede in this dangerous spiral of tension. Foremost among these was the peace-keeping activities of the United Nations Secretary-General and of the Security Council. Twice in the space of two months  first in March and then in April  Malta requested the convening of the Security Council to consider the dangerous situation in the central Mediterranean. In the Council we earnestly urged that the power of reason and good-will be permitted to prevail  that recourse be made exclusively to the measures for the peaceful settlement of disputes envisaged under the Charter and that the United Nations Secretary-General be entrusted with using his good offices in the situation.At the same time we also explored the possibility of bringing about collective action at the regional level. In this spirit Malta's Prime Minister twice invited his Mediterranean colleagues  first in January and then again in April  to meet in order to discuss and make the corresponding undertakings deriving from the related issues of non-use of force  non-use of bases and dis-allowance of terrorist training in or action from the territories of what were to be contracting parties to a Mediterranean compact for peace.Unfortunately  none of these initiatives vote fruit  and the spiral of violence reached the stage of an armed attack by one State against another. Events in recent weeks have made it clear that the April bombings were not at all theremedy they were purported to be but just another escalation in the spiral of violence and tension.One compensating element in the events of April was the fact that no Mediterranean state  whether aligned or not  permitted the use of its territory for the planned act of aggression against another Mediterranean state. It is such a stirring  however isolated  of that appears to be a regional consciousness that confirms our commitment to continue working foe the eventual transformation of the Mediterranean into a zone of peace  friendship and co-operation. Neutral Malta is determined  if a similar situation should again arise  once again to take peaceinitiatives analogous to the ones it pursued earlier this year. Malta also finds ample scope for wide-ranging initiatives  inspired by its status of neutrality and non-alignment  in the various international forums in which it actively participates.The United Nations forum  harassed as it is by difficulties of an administrative as well as a political nature  remains the corner-stone of all initiatives aimed at the establishment of a more structured and regulated multilateral system. Mich is often made of the voting patterns which emerge in the course of decision-making at the United Nations. Malta's own votes are invariably governed by i ts chosen status of neutrality based on the principles of non-alignment. This was the case during our tenure of the Security Council seat in 1983-1984  as it is still during the annual sessions of the united Nations General Assembly.Regarding concrete initiatives  we are conscious of the fate that befalls such far-reaching concepts as the one we helped to launch almost 20 years ago concerning the definition of the high seas as the common heritage of mankind. This was adopted unanimously in the late 1960s  debated extensively during the 1970s and translated into a comprehensive convention in the early 1980s. Today the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea languishes awaiting signature by a few of the moat important United Nations Members that labored so publicly for its elaboration. We shall persist in our endeavors to ensure universal adherence to the basic United Nations Convention.In the light of such frustrating experiences  we have more recently sought to tailor our initiatives more closely to the prevailing realities. This has not prevented us from launching useful initiatives. During this very session of the General Assembly  for example  we shall be seeking to bring to fruition an idea we have long pursued  namely  the creation of an institute for aging  which we should be prepared to host in Malta in the framework of the Foundation for International Studies  which we have recently created. Another initiative which we have actively pursued during General Assembly sessions is the resolve to define the Mediterranean as a zone of peace and co-operation. We have piloted a number of consensus resolutions on this subject in recent years. It is our hope that this year our draft will mark a significant step forward towards our objective. We also find it most useful to pursue functional projects within the framework of the competent organs of the United Nations system. Such functional projects once properly refined can make a significant contribution to the overall objective of regional co-operation and security in the Mediterranean region.It is in this context that we have proposed to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) the launching of a regional project intended to elaborate a development plan for the whole Mediterranean area. Within the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) we are pursuing the initiative of bringing together the representatives of the three major religions in the Mediterranean region  with the aim of creating the opportunity and tolerance in an area which has unfortunately been the traditional source of deep-rooted divisions and prejudices in our region.Within the framework of the united Nations Environment Program (UNEP) we continue to participate actively in the action plan for the protection of the Mediterranean environment  a project which not only has been of marked benefit to our region but also served as a model for similar initiatives elsewhere.The Commonwealth is another forum which as provided Malta with many opportunities for giving concrete application to its dedication to neutrality and non-alignment. Because of the Commonwealth's own previous connection with South Africa  it takes an especially active role in seeking to eliminate the evils of racial oppression and acts of aggression practiced by the white minority regime in South Africa.Commonwealth actions in this context cover the whole range of possible options. The call for a severe limitation  and where possible total elimination  of all contacts with South Africa  in the commercial  industrial  financial  cultural  sport and other sectors is very clear at the Commonwealth level. At the same time the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation organizes various projects of assistance for student from Namibia and South Africa. These permit even countries with extremely limited national resources like Malta to play a part in these constructive efforts. Indeed many students from Rhodesia in the 1970's  Namibia in the early 1980's  and soon from South Africa itself will have benefited through this scheme from the various training facilities available in Malta. In this way we are also playing a role in the efforts towards bringing about the much needed radical changes in southern Africa  preferably with a minimum of violence and bloodshed.Through the Non-Aligned Movement Malta has been able to join in many far-reaching initiatives aimed at instituting the process of regional consultations in the Mediterranean. Under a mandate from the Seventh Summit the 11 Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Mediterranean members met in Valletta in September 1984 in a historic first meeting on co-operation for peace and security in the Mediterranean. This first meeting laid the foundations for regular co-operation not only among the Non-Aligned Mediterranean members themselves but also between them and the other States in the region. The Eighth Summit in Harare this September agreed on a mandate for further meetings of Non-Aligned Mediterranean Members. Preparations for the second meeting which is to be held in Yugoslavia in the very near future are actively under way.Malta's initiatives on the Mediterranean  in the context of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) complement its initiatives within the Non-Aligned Movement. The CSCE forum creates a unique opportunity for collective action by the neutral and Non-Aligned States of the region in the pursuit of Euro-Mediterranean security and co-operation.The Helsinki Final Act established the principle that there is no security in Europe without security in the Mediterranean. In the Belgrade follow-up meeting of the CSCE Malta launched the initiative for a meeting on Mediterranean co-operation which was held in Valletta in 1979  and to which other Mediterranean States were invited. This was followed in 1984 by a second meeting in Venice. In the Madrid follow-up meeting of the CSCE Malta sought to launch a parallel process of Euro-Mediterranean consultations on security questions. Though this proposal did not receive open support at the time  we are now encouraged to note that General Secretary Gorbachev has recently openly expounded a similar idea. It is our hope that this can now be taken up in the next CSCE follow-up meeting due to start in Vienna next month.The Vienna meeting will also have before it the results of the first phase of the Conference on disarmament in Europe. The recently concluded Stockholm conference reached significant agreement on measures for confidence and security building in Europe as a prelude to more substantive discussions on disarmament proper due in a subsequent stage. It included amphibious and naval activities supportive of ongoing land activities in the new confidence and security building regime. Naval activities in the Mediterranean  as elsewhere in Europe  are therefore now included in a scheme aimed at reducing the risks of conflict throughout Europe. Malta will seek to ensure that this significant breakthrough will be consolidated in the mandate for the second phase of the Conference to be elaborated in Vienna. We remain convinced  and recent events have amply confirmed  that all naval activities in the Mediterranean have a direct bearing on all security considerations in the whole Euro-Mediterranean region. Another multilateral forum which provides Malta with an opportunity to pursue policies inspired by its neutral and Non-Aligned status is the Council of Europe. Here again the opportunity for co-ordination with the other neutral States of Europe is extremely valuable.Malta wishes to utilize the Council of Europe forum to resist the concept of Europe as a perpetually divided continent. In this framework Malta co-operates with the other neutral members of the Council of Europe to create as many opportunities as possible for non-member European States to participate in the Council's activities.At the same time Malta also believes in the need for Council of Europe members to extend an arm of co-operation towards their Arab neighbors in the Mediterranean. Recent events in the Mediterranean  with the focus they have thrown on international terrorism  have created a subject of particular interest and concern both to Europeans and Arabs. This could usefully become the subject of consultations between them. For this purpose Malta has proposed the creation of a small contact group for representatives of the Council of Europe membership to meet representatives of the Arab League membership and discuss the subject in all its aspects. The Secretary-General of the Arab League has signified to us the interest of his membership in this proposal. Malta has already raised the proposal in the appropriate organs of the Council of Europe  and intends to pursue it further  especially during the forthcoming ministerial conference on terrorism.All peoples and nations of the world have a common understanding of what they mean and intend when they express their deep aspirations for peace and security. It is a fact of life  however  that the means preferred in the pursuit of these common aspirations very often differ radically from one another. Malta is convinced that peace can only be obtained through peaceful means  and that the tools of war invariably lead to bitterness and conflict. We believe that the multilateral system of international relations  based upon respect for the rule of law  and mutual respect among States  is an indispensable approach towards disarmament  security and co-operation  peace and progress  through neutrality and non-alignment  manifestation of these fundamental convictions.aspect of any successful Malta's dedication to is for us the essential"
"90",4704,"MMR",41,1986," Allow me first to convey to you  sir  the warm and sincere congratulations of the delegation of Burma  and my own  on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. We are particularly pleased to see you  a good friend from a friendly neighboring country  presiding over this session of the Assembly. Your long and distinguished career and your wide knowledge of international affairs and of the practices of the United Nations are a guarantee to all of us that the proceedings of this session will be conducted efficiently and effectively towards a successful conclusion. I wish to assure you of the full support and co-operation of the delegation of Burma.May I also express our deep appreciation and gratitude to your eminent predecessor  Ambassador Jaime de Pinie's  for his able guidance of the historic fortieth session of the General Assembly.For the past several years the Assembly has been working under conditions of marked international tension. In our view  the world today is less secure and moreprecarious than the world that the framers of the Charter envisaged some 40 years ago. We live today in a time of uncertainty  and  far from diminishing  tensions and conflicts are on the increase. Although a global war has so far been avoided  the threat of a nuclear conflagration continues to be of growing concern to all mankind.For all nations  the concept of security is a subjective matter. For a few  security is being sought through reliance on nuclear weapons  and for the majority  the essence is the defense of their sovereignty and independence. At a time of widening disparity between abundance and want  in which the international system has a diminishing capacity for just and ecruitable co-operation between nations  particularly between the developed and the developing  it becomes increasingly important that the issues of peace  security  economic well-being and social justice  as well as other major issues of global concern  be dealt with effectively through co-operation within the United Nations system. Much depends upon the political will and attitude of States  particularly the more powerful ones. It is therefore clear that the national interests of individual States can best be served by meeting the wider interests of the world at large. The commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations during last year's session of the General Assembly was an important landmark in the history of the Organization. It can truly be considered as an occasion that goes beyond its symbolic significance. It provided a unique opportunity for all its members to give expression to the fact that the United Nations constitutes the best hope for mankind to live in peace and prosperity. To realize that hcJpe it is necessary for its members to participate in the United Nations system with a deeper commitment to its principles. In that context  the Secretary-General said in his concluding statement:""The commemoration assumed the importance that it did because international relations had reached a critical stage. The time has come to reflect on where a retreat from multilateralism would lead the world."" (A/40/PV. 49  p. 2) Mankind has been afflicted by wars since the dawn of history. Yet every human heart has cherished peace  and the need for peace has never been stronger or more compelling than it is now. It was a most propitious omen that the General Assembly at its last session proclaimed 1986 the International Year of Peace. We hope that the political momentum thus created will continue and create conditions favorable to peace in the years ahead.The United Nations is not a government of nations  nor does it have all the answers to the ills that afflict the world today. But without doubt it can be an effective instrument in our search for solutions to the problems of the world and  beyond that  in building a more peaceful and just system of relations between States.Time and again it has been said that the diminishing capacity of the United Nations to carry out the functions for which it was intended lies not in the Organization itself  but in the lack of political will on the part of its Members to ensure the implementation of the provisions of the Charter. That is particularly relevant with regard to Article 2 (4) of the Charter  which prohibits the threat or the use of force and in relations between States in the interests of maintaining international peace and security  which remains an unattained goal. We find today a situation in which it is becoming increasingly difficult for smaller nations to place their reliance on the Charter to ensure their security.Security and survival are the foremost concern of our time. This has never been more keenly felt by the world  and the greatest challenge to mankind is to avert the threat of a nuclear catastrophe. The most urgent task of our time is the prevention of nuclear war. International peace and security can be ensured only by meaningful disarmament  for in the final analysis the possession and continued accumulation of nuclear weapons leaves the door open to the risk of a global disaster.Progress in disarmament negotiations depends largely on lessening mutual distrust  and for all practical purposes the militarily significant States  particularly the two most powerful  have a special responsibility to accelerate the ongoing negotiations.Meaningful efforts made recently to halt and reverse the nuclear arms race give us a renewed sense of hope that serious initiatives have been taken to avert the dangers arising from the existence of nuclear weapons. We feel that a favorable political climate conducive to better understanding would enhance the prospects of disarmament.However  we cannot fail to note the lack of consistency in the approach  where efforts made to reach agreements on disarmament are negated by an arms race conducted without respite  which defeats the very purpose of the negotiations.Negotiations at the bilateral level should have a positive bearing at the multilateral level  and constitute a source of encouragement to give the political impetus that is needed for meaningful work in the multilateral context. It is rightly said that international security is the concern of all nations and peoples. Thus negotiations between the Soviet union and the United States cannot diminish the importance of multilateral disarmament efforts.However  we are in a situation in which multilateral disarmament negotiations are at an impasse. Though the issues of disarmament have been on the agenda of the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament for several years  meaningful results have yet to be attained  and the underlying reason for that is the lack of political will on the part of some Members. A recommitment to negotiations at the multilateral level is needed to remedy the situation. Multilateral negotiations have contributed much to the achievement of disarmament agreements in the past. It is also important to maintain the viability and validity of the disarmament agreements reached so far  to enhance the prospects of further positive measures.The potential threat of the extension of the arms race into outer space constitutes a new danger. It is inconceivable that the arms race can be halted and effective measures taken on earth unless steps can be taken  while there is still time  to prevent a new dimension of the arms race in outer space.In view of the operational capabilities that are new being developed  it is a matter of urgent concern that only timely action can prevent the escalation of the arms race into outer space  which could intensify the arms race on earth.We feel the answer lies in the reduction of nuclear weapons on earth and the prevention of an arms race in outer space. It does not appear feasible that the deployment of new weapons systems in outer space can remove the threat that nuclear weapons pose on earth. The situation in Kampuchea continues to be a matter of international concern  as the prolongation of the conflict has serious implications for international peace and security. It inhibits the promotion of friendly relations and co-operation between States within the region.The fundamental issue is to create conditions favorable to the exercise by the Kampuchean people of their right of self-determination. The restoration of their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity requires the withdrawal of foreign troops and non-intervention by other States in the country's internal affairs.It is undoubtedly the Kampuchean people themselves who must determine their own future. At the same time  the search for a meaningful solution rests on efforts by the international community  as well as the States concerned within the region. The efforts of the Secretary-General have produced a positive momentum for better understanding between the parties concerned. In the search for a peaceful solution through the process of genuine negotiation and mutual accommodation  it is important to recall what the Secretary-General said in his 1985 report on the situation: that the problems of the region cannot be solved by military means  and that protracted confrontation can only generate further tension and enhance the risks of escalation. In our consideration of the situation in Afghanistan  we should understand that the underlying problem concerns the fundamental principles on which relations between States must be based. The delegation of Burma endorses the support of the international community for efforts to arrive at a negotiated settlement in accordance with resolutions of the United Nations. The diplomatic process initiated by the Secretary-General is commendable  in that the stage has now been reached at which it is possible to finalize the texts to be agreed upon relating to non-interference in the affairs of States  international guarantees of non-interference and the voluntary return of refugees to their homeland. It is therefore necessary to continue the process in order to reach a just and comprehensive political settlement. Resolution of the outstanding substantive issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops is essential for the achievement of such a settlement.Prom the time of its inception almost the United Nations has been actively involved in the continuing search for a political solution to the problems of the Middle East. Its activities in the region have been significant. Prospects for a comprehensive solution of the Middle East issue continue to be elusive despite efforts both within and outside the United Nations. The path to peace in the Middle East lies in the willingness of all the parties concerned genuinely to co-operate in the peace process. The present situation lessens the prospects for optimism  as the current year has witnessed a mounting wave of violence in the region.The problem of Palestine is central to the Middle East problem and therefore constitutes the key to its solution. Needless to say  the principles and framework for a peaceful solution were formulated long ago and have been affirmed repeatedly by the General Assembly and the Security Council. Those principles are the withdrawal of all forces of occupation from the occupied territories in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  independence and sovereignty and the right of all States in the region to exist within internationally recognized borders.In recent years no country in the Middle East has been more affected by war and devastation than Lebanon. Peace in Lebanon lies in respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the country. This calls for respect for the relevant resolutions of the Security Council  which would enable the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to carry out effectively its mandate in southern Lebanon.On the conflict between Iran and Iraq  we share the concern of the world community. Despite the efforts of the United Nations  and particularly of the Secretary-General  the war has brought untold suffering and devastation to bothsides and has serious implications for peace and stability in the region. Recourse to arms is contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter  and the best hope lies in both parties submitting to mediation or to any other means of peaceful settlement in accordance with Security Council resolution 582 (1986).The aggravation of the situation in southern Africa continues to be of concern not only to the African continent but also to the world at large. This is evident from the fact that the Security Council has been preoccupied with issues relating to the region on numerous occasions in the course of the present year.The complexity of the situation has three basic dimensions: first  South Africa continues relentlessly to practice the abhorrent system of apartheid; secondly  its illegal occupation of Namibia  contrary to the aspirations of its people and the will of the international community  continues; and  thirdly  it has further intensified acts of aggression against neighboring independent States. This policy of destabilization of its neighbors is contrary to the norms of international law and violates the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of those States. The principle of non-intervention in the affairs of other States  which is one of the mainstays of stable inter-State relations  has been ignored by the South African regime.South Africa  by its blatant occupation of Namibia  disregards all relevant resolutions of the United Nations. It continues to use delaying tactics to place obstacles in the way of implementation of resolution 435 (1978)  which constitutes the internationally acceptable basis for the independence of Namibia. The international community has found it necessary to call once again on South Africa to co-operate in good faith to bring about the immediate implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. The eradication of apartheid and unconditional independence: for Namibia would create the conditions necessary for the return of peace to South Africa.The escalation of violence and force in South Africa has led to an urgent international call for the exercise of pressure through peaceful means to make the regime realize the futility of its policies. The World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  held in Paris earlier this year  considered the situation in South Africa to be extremely grave. It stressed the imperative need to take all necessary action  with a sense of urgency  for the speedy abolition of apartheid and to end the violence in South Africa  the illegal occupation of Namibia and acts of aggression against independent African States. With those objectives  the Conference called for a comprehensive program of action by the international community and mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.For four successive years the item relating to the situation in Central America has been on the agenda of the General Assembly. It is evident that solutions should be found within a regional framework through the Contadora peace process  since it is acceptable to all the parties involved in the search for a negotiated peace settlement. It is noteworthy that the Contadora Group has persevered in its efforts to restore peace and co-operation in Central America. The international community can contribute most positively by extending continued support and encouragement.While the world's political situation offers little cause for optimism  the global economic scene is also quite disheartening. The world economy continues to face difficulties. Imbalances in the international economic situation are likely to deteriorate further  with adverse implications for the economies of developing countries. The persistence of such a situation demonstrates that the crisis is not just a temporary phenomenon but the result of long-rooted imbalances in the international economic structure. The perception that expansion of production in the industrialized countries will automatically lead to growth in developing countries new seems to have faded.The developing countries in general continue to face serious balance-of-payments problems and are unable to stimulate economic development through the medium of domestic policies. They are adversely affected by deteriorating terms of trade  debt problems and falling commodity prices  all of which hamper their prospects of growth and aggravate their indebtedness.The developing countries are aware of the need to reactivate growth through domestic policies and coherent international economic co-operation in the areas of money  finance  trade and debt. An overall improvement in the situation would come about through sustained expansion of world economic activity  improvement in the terms of trade of developing countries  escape from high interest rates  an upswing in commodity prices and reversal of the increasing trend towards restrictionism and protectionism.The international trade and payments system  with national economies weakened as they are  has very little capacity for additional strain. An examination of how it may be reordered and restructured to promote better economic performance by national economies is urgently needed. Reform of the trade and payments system is unlikely  given the present arrangements for international economic discussions  which separate from one another the interrelated problems of development  employment  debt and trade and payment balances  the major obstacle being that decisions on international monetary and financial systems remain the exclusive preserve of the minority rich nations.One of the immediate issues is debt  which can be satisfactorily resolved only in the wider context of reform of the trade and payments system. At the same time  the system itself will inevitably be affected and its long-term evolution heavily influenced by decisions regarding debt in the more immediate future. The developing countries experiencing debt servicing problems have already made substantial policy efforts to reduce external deficits through cutting back imports and reducing growth. Internal adjustment programs made by debtor countries with a view to relieving the acute debt problems  and any other ad hoc measures  would not solve the problem.Prom this wider perspective the reordering and restructuring of the international trade and payments system need to be addressed in a constructive  co-operative and comprehensive manner. This calls for the restructuring of international trade  and monetary and development institutions  so that their decision-making process and functioning as a whole could become more equitable  just  and conducive to promoting development and global prosperity. It does not appear that ad hoc policies in a narrower context would solve comprehensively the problems of the developing countries or even those which enjoy substantial advantages from the existing international economic order.Finally  may I deal with the most overriding issue before us. This session of the General Assembly will give serious consideration to the financial crisis which the United Nations faces. The Secretary-General  in bringing the situation to the attention of the resumed session of the General Assembly last May  said that what is at stake is the operational effectiveness of the United Nations. The consensus of opinion expressed by delegations during the resumed session was that  while the present crisis is one of insufficient funds  it is also one of political dimensions. From this broader perspective  while measures of a financial nature are being taken to alleviate the situation in the short term  the search for long-term solutions requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that needs to take the broad political perspectives into consideration. Although considerations on a more effective use of funds is an integral part of solving the crisis  it has not arisen because expenditure has exceeded the Organization's regular budget  what is of serious concern is the deficit in cash flews  which has been felt over the years due to withholdings of assessed contributions  particularly by some of the permanent members of the Security Council. When unilateral decisions create huge deficits in cash flows  the crisis assumes serious proportions; the integrity and viability of the United Nations system becomes an issue when such actions contradict the obligations of membership.This session will need to find long-term solutions and to consider the recommendations by the Group of High-Level Experts  whose mandate is to identify measures for improving the efficiency of administrative and financial matters of the United Nations. We believe that concerted efforts by all Member States is urgently needed; only the fulfillment of each Member's obligations would ensure the future of this Organization  which  despite some failings  has also achieved much.Allow me to conclude by stating that my delegation expresses the hope that  at this Assembly  we shall help to find ways and means of overcoming the many obstacles which stand in the way of resolving the numerous problems that beset us. In so doing we can infuse new life and vigor in the United Nations and reinvest the Charter with its full force of inspiration."
"91",4761,"MNG",41,1986," I should like to assure you. Sir  that the Mongolian delegation associates itself with the warm words of congratulation that have been conveyed both to you and to the President by preceding speakers in connection with your unanimous elections to your respective offices to preside over the forty-first session of the General Assembly. We are hopeful that the President's rich diplomatic experience  competence and high sense of duty will greatly promote the success of this session.On behalf of the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic  it is also my pleasure to extend a cordial greeting to the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and to wish him every possible success.The present session of the United Nations General Assembly is a particularly meaningful one. It is being held in the year proclaimed by common consent as the International Year of Peace. That important decision reflects the growing anxiety of the world community over the current complex international situation and its resolve to exert every effort to check further deterioration of the situation and the escalation of the nuclear threat.Prevention of a nuclear war end safeguarding peace is a difficult but attainable objective. The current world situation demands the removal of the old stereotypes such as the doctrines of ""containment"" or ""deterrence"". They have become outdated. It is essential to undertake without delay concrete and effective measures leading to radical changes from nuclear rivalry to a nuclear-free world  from confrontation to co-operation  from the arras race to disarmament.What is the stunting-block to such a change in international relations so vital for mankind?The root cause of the evil lies primarily in the policy aid practical actions of the most aggressive circles of imperialism  first and foremost the military-industrial complex of the United States of America. They seek to attain a military-strategic superiority and to achieve their neo-global is tic objectives through blackmail  sanctions and acts of State terrorism  including armed intervention against countries and peoples who refuse to submit to their diktat.The militaristic and revanchist approach to such fundamental issues of the day as questions of war and peace and the right of peoples freely to decide their own destiny is fraught with the most disastrous consequences for the whole of mankind.Imperial policy is counterbalanced by the growing peace potential represented by the world socialist community  the non-aligned countries and other peace-loving States  the anti-war and anti-nuclear moves and the forces of common sense. The year 1986 is marked by active endeavors and fresh initiatives aimed at preventing a nuclear war  ending the arms race and improving the international situation.The proposal on the question of establishing a comprehensive system of international security  submitted by the socialist countries for consideration at this session  represents the most rational approach to ensuring universal peace. It is designed to lay down the bases for collective security in the military  political  economic  social and humanitarian fields.The way to establish the most decisive component of such a system 'is proposed in the concrete program worked out by the Soviet Union to deliver mankind from nuclear and other types of mass-destruction weapons by the end of this century. This program has been complemented by the Budapest Appeal by the Warsaw Treaty States addressed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) States and all other European countries. It envisages a wide range of concrete measures for reducing the armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe  a matter which is also of global importance.The statement of the Soviet Government of 23 April this year and the speech in Vladivostok  by Mr. Gorbachev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  outlined a host of practical measures designed to improve the international situation in Asia and the Pacific  consolidate mutual confidence and promote good-neighborliness and co-operation between the countries of the region. Last  but not least  it should be recalled that at the previous General Assembly session the socialist countries submitted a comprehensive proposal on international economic security.Thus  the new proposal by the socialist countries is built on the solid asset of their previous proposals related to reducing the nuclear threat and military confrontation and promoting detente and peaceful co-existence through the active interaction and co-operation of States.A comprehensive system of international security envisages that the collective security of all nations on a mutual and eouitable basis will be ensured. The co-sponsors proceed from the premise that the security of a State or a group of States cannot be safeguarded at the expense of others.This initiative of the socialist countries further strengthens the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter on the system of collective security. Its objective is to give practical effect to these provisions  duly talcking into account the realities of the nuclear-space age. The Mongolian People's Republic has co-sponsored this new initiative.At the nineteenth Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party  held in late May this year. Comrade Jambyn Batmunkh  General Secretary of the Party Central Committee and Head of State  pointed out that a comprehensive system of international security is designed to make peaceful co-existence the highest universal principle of relations between nations. As a co-sponsor we have also borne in mind the provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace  which makes it incumbent upon every State to take concrete measures for the implementation of this basic right of peoples. The delegation o£ the Mongolian People's Republic appeals to all Member States of the United Nations to give thorough consideration to the ideas contemplated in the new proposal of the socialist countries and to contribute to their practical achievement.The Mongolian delegation notes with satisfaction that the spirit and content of the Harare Declarations adopted by the Eighth Summit Conference of the non-aligned countries are consistent in many respects with the objectives of the proposal of the socialist countries. Here I wish to quote from the report of the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  regarding an idea which is along the same lines as our:""... in a world where the destinies of all countries are almost certain to become ever more closely linked  there can be no substitute for an effective multilateral system in the maintenance of international peace and security and in the co-operative management of global problems."" (A/41/1  pp. 2-3) Every practical step that promotes the achievement of the important goal of comprehensive security is indeed of great importance.The Mongolian People's Republic  like the overwhelming majority of States  highly values the widely acclaimed unilateral moratorium on all nuclear explosions declared by the Soviet Union over a year ago and extended until the beginning of next year. Were it to become mutual and multilateral  a reliable barrier would be placed in the way of the further qualitative improvement of nuclear arms. My delegation calls upon all other nuclear-weapon states  above all the United States  to join in the moratorium and to start wording out an agreement on a comprehensive ban of nuclear-weapon tests. It welcomes the readiness of the Soviet Union  reaffirmed at this session  to sign such an agreement at any time.The Mongolian People's Republic highly appreciates the efforts of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Tanzania and Sweden  which have offered practical proposals to contribute to the banning of nuclear tests and the adoption of other measures aimed at curbing the nuclear arms race.A tangible step towards preventing the outbreak of a nuclear war would be for all nuclear-weapon Powers  following the example of the Onion of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Chinese People's Republic  to undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. Such a step would certainly contribute to strengthening the atmosphere of trust between States  and also enhance the security of non-nuclear-weapon States.The Mongolian People's Republic supports all proposals and practical steps aimed at creating nuclear-free zones and corridors in Europe  Asia and other regions  and views them as important measures promoting the goals of nuclear disarmament.While welcoming the progress achieved in the talks at the Conference on Disarmament on banning chemical weapons  my delegation would like especially to emphasize the need for the earliest achievement of an agreement on banning that barbaric means of the mass annihilation of human beings.The international community should not allow existing treaties and agreements in various fields of arms limitation to be undermined. Strict observance of the obligations undertaken by all sides constitutes an indispensable perquisite for achieving agreements in new fields.We note with satisfaction that despite the existing real difficulties  as well as obstacles  that are often artificially erected by certain quarters  the contacts and dialog between the USSR and the united States  the two leading Powers  are becoming of a more active and practical character.The Mongolian People's Republic welcomes the forthcoming Soviet-American summit meeting on 11-12 October of this year in Reykjavik. We hope that this summit meeting will pave the way for achieving practical agreements in the field of the limitation and subsequent elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction as well as in preventing the militarization of outer space.Facts show that progress would depend upon the extent to which the United States side displays the necessary degree of responsibility commensurate with the importance of the measures to be agreed upon.In this age of scientific and technical progress the uses of its achievements for the benefit of man has become an objective of top priority. In the first place  this relates to the exploitation of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and the peaceful uses of outer space. Mongolia supports the convening of an international conference to consider material  political  legal and institutional bases for concerted action in peaceful uses of outer space. My Government endorses the efforts being made within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure the safety of nuclear energy use. It will accede to the two important conventions adopted at the recent special session of the IAEA General Conference.My Government welcomes the outcome of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe as a real contribution to the reduction of military confrontation  to strengthening security in Europe  and as an example of reasonable compromise and realism. We hope that the spirit of Stockholm will have a favorable impact on the work of the forthcoming November follow-up meeting of the representatives of the countries at the Conference and likewise on the Vienna negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments.International peace would be considerably strengthened if hotbeds of tensions and crisis situations were eliminated in various parts of the world. It is regrettable  however  that regional conflicts in various parts of the world not only persist but sometimes even aggravate and threaten to undermine the basis of universal security.Many of the regional conflicts are taking place in the Asia-Pacific region. The Middle East cr is is  the Iran-Iraqi conflict  the undeclared war against Afghanistan and the provocations against Kampuchea sow death and devastation and poison the atmosphere on the continent and throughout the world.The Mongolian People's Republic supports the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under United Nations auspices with the participation of all interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO). To this end we deem it desirable to reach agreement  at this session of the General Assembly  to establish a preparatory committee which would include all the permanent members of the Security Council.The crux of the Middle East settlement lies in the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to the establishment of its own independent state and in the complete liberation of all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967. Mongolia supports the strengthening of the national independence and Territorial integrity of Lebanon.We add our voice to appeals by the world community to the Governments of Iran and Iraq to put an immediate end to their military actions and to enter into peaceful negotiations aimed at resolving the outstanding disputes between them.Our Government firmly supports the proposal on a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus problem on the basis of full respect for its independence and territorial integrity.We consider that a favorable prerequisite for political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan has been created by the decision of the Governments of the Soviet Onion and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to withdraw this year a considerable part of the Soviet military contingent from Afghanistan. We hope that this act of good-will will meet with a positive response. A necessary guarantee for the cessation and non-recurrence of outside interference in the affairs of Afghanistan should be worked out. The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic duly appreciates the efforts by the United Nations Secretary-General and his Special Representative towards bringing about a political settlement to this problem.The Mongolian People's Republic is in favor of turning South-East Asia into a zone of peace  stability and co-operation. Cessation of encroachments upon the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the bellicose acts against the other countries of Indochina would greatly benefit the efforts made to create an atmosphere of mutual understanding and confidence in the region. My delegation reaffirms again the continuing support of its Government to the constructive approaches taken by Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea and to their consistent efforts to stabilize the situation in south-East Asia. My Government  as before  lends its consistent support to the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on €t*s withdrawal of American troops and armaments frost the south of the Korean' peninsula  on the creation of a nuclear-free zone there  and to this end the initiation of tripartite negotiations. Realization of these measures would create an atmosphere conducive to the peaceful reunification of Korea and would substantially help to improve the situation in the Far East.The situation in the Asia-Pacific region has been aggravated by the growing United States military presence and the build-up of its nuclear arsenals there  especially in South Korea and around Japan. The latter is being increasingly drawn into the orbit of the military-strategic schemes of Washington  including participation in research on the so-called Strategic Defense Initiative. Attempts to turn the Asia-Pacific region into another arena of military and political confrontation are being accelerated. To halt and reverse the negative development of events in Asia and the Pacific  it is imperative that a common search for ways and means of promoting the idea of a comprehensive system of regional security be intensified. In that connection  I should like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the proposal of the Mongolian People's Republic for the creation of international machinery that would proscribe the use or threat of force in relations between Asian and Pacific States. Consistent compliance with that principle as an accepted norm in relations among States of the region would undoubtedly contribute to the stabilization of the situation and the consolidation of the foundations of peace and security.The nineteenth Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party underlined the fact that the complexity of the current situation calls for all States of the region  large and small  to explore together means of achieving regional security and to take collective action to solve crisis situations and outstanding problems. We believe that the time is ripe for engaging more actively in political consultation and dialog on a bilateral and multilateral basis and assessing the feasibility of convening  at some later date  an Asian-Pacific forum devoted to problems of regional peace and security.The threat of armed intervention against Nicaragua is becoming ever greater. Attempts are being made to export counter-revolution with the help of traitors to the Nicaraguan people  to stem its revolutionary gains and to compel it to retreat from its chosen path.The Mongolian People's Republic supports the constructive approach of the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua with regard to a peaceful solution to the Central American problem. The Mongolian people will continue to stand by the Nicaraguan people  which is defending its independence and freedom with great courage. We support the efforts of the Contadora group and the Support group aimedat lessening tension in Central America and the Caribbean and finding political solutions to the urgent problems of the region.The explosive situation in South Africa poses a serious threat to world peace. The people and Government of the Mongolian People's Republic resolutely condemn the racist regime of South Africa  which seeks to perpetuate at any cost the inhumane system of apartheid. We fully support the Declaration of the World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  which called for the immediate imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the Pretoria regime under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Apartheid has no place in our world and it should be eradicated once and for all. We demand the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and other patriots in South Africa and reaffirm our solidarity with the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC).The South African regime  relying on the United States policy of so-called constructive engagement  is pursuing an expansionist policy in southern Africa. Our Government strongly condemns the armed aggression and acts of destabilization ceaselessly committed by the Pretoria regime against Angola  Zambia  Zimbabwe  Mozambique and other front-line States.The problem of granting immediate independence to the Namibian people continues to focus the attention of the international community. This is evidenced by the results of the International Conference held in Vienna as well as the special session of the General Assembly which has just ended its work. Full implementation of the decisions adopted at those important forums will undoubtedly help to boost the efforts of the international community to put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia and to speed up the granting of independence to Namibia  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. The Mongolian People's Republic supports the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people.My delegation fully supports the decisions of the eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries on the problems of southern Africa and on intensifying the struggle against apartheid.The Mongolian People's Republic is in favor of granting unconditional and immediate independence to the peoples of Micronesia  Puerto Rico and other dependent Territories.The Mongolian People's Republic most resolutely condemns acts of terrorism  no matter what their motivation. At the same time  we assail the actions of those who  under the guise of fighting terrorism  resort to brute force and armed aggression against other sovereign states  as was the case with regard to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.The struggle of peoples for their national liberation has now entered a new phase in their fight to achieve genuine economic independence and social progress.He fully support the intensification of efforts to establish a new international economic order based on justice and equality. Such a need is particularly overriding in the light of the deteriorating economic conditions in the developing countries. Their growing external debt  which now exceeds $1 billion  has become an awesome challenge. There is an urgent need to introduce basic and structural changes in the economic relations between the leading Western Powers and the developing countries and to carry out practical measures aimed at ensuring genuine economic security for all States. It is quite natural to expect this issue to become a central point in the deliberations of this session of the General Assembly.Twenty-five years have passed since my country's admission to the united Nations. The Mongolian People's Republic has done its best throughout that period to contribute to the improvement of the effectiveness of the United Nations as an instrument for maintaining international peace and security. On the initiative of the Mongolian People's Republic  the United Nations adopted a decision to observe every year a week devoted to fostering the objectives of disarmament. The Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace has also been adopted. Me try to take an active part in the activities of the Organization in social and humanitarian fields. Our delegation intends to propose at this session of the General Assembly the proclamation of a United Nations campaign for the eradication of illiteracy. The campaign could cover a period lasting to the year 2000.We share the opinion that the root cause of the difficulties the United Nations is at present undergoing is first and foremost political and for that very reason has implications for the Organization far beyond the state of its finances.The role of the United Nations as a multilateral forum for broad co-operation among States is acquiring even greater significance. Therefore  those who attempt to undermine it are assuming a serious responsibility before world public opinion.From this high rostrum  my delegation would like to reiterate the commitment of the Government of the Mongolian People' s Republic to the purposes and principles of this most prestigious world body."
"92",4803,"MOZ",41,1986," On behalf of the People's Republic of Mozambique it gives me pleasure to congratulate Ambassador Choudhury on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. His election to such a high office expresses the confidence of all of us in his outstanding qualities as an able and experienced diplomat. I am confidentthat under his guidance the deliberations of this session will be crowned with success. I assure him at the outset of our total readiness to co-operate with hint in the discharge of the functions entrusted to him.X congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  who guided with competence the deliberations of the historic fortieth session of the General Assembly.I wish to express once again to the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  my appreciation of his zeal and his devotion to the United Nations cause as well as to that of the fulfillment of the principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter. I also wish to express the feelings of satisfaction of the Government I represent ^t seeing the Secretary-General back with us and fully recovered.It is with deep concern that our Organization is witnessing a proliferation of conflicts and tensions in the international arena.Southern Africa is one of the most worrying regions of conflict. The apartheid regime constitutes  by its policy and practices  a serious threat to international peace and security. In advocating theories of racial supremacy and claiming a divine mission assigned to the Afrikaner tribe  in perpetrating systematic massacres against the majority of the population  apartheid is Zionism. Like Zionism  the apartheid regime seeks to impose its power on the region through aggression and occupation. Thus  it occupies Namibia and parts of the territory of Angola. It attacks neighboring countries  including those whose economic and military weakness and small populations pose no threat to the security of the South African regime. The tactics of armed banditry used by Hitler to destabilize and destroy targeted countries are today used by Pretoria in southern Africa. In Mozambique  Angola  Zimbabwe and other countries in southern Africa  armed bandits  trained  equipped  transported  organized  financed and commanded by South Africa  commit horrible crimes against people and their property. Hitler's ambitions to establish a Germanic Europe find their counterpart in our region in the South African theory of the establishment of a constellation of States which would be under the dominance of the Afrikaner regime. All this shows the Nazi-Fascist nature of the regime in Pretoria  a regime that constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.It is against this heinous regime that the South African people stand up with courage and determination within South Africa. It is a heroic struggle that has achieved unprecedented development in the last two years. The South African people  under the leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) and other progressive and democratic forces  have taken the initiative in transforming South African society and creating an ambiance of equality  liberty and justice. They are more conscious than ever of the justness of their cause. Assassinations and massacres have failed to deter the people's movement  thus proving that unarmed people  when they are united  determined and fighting for a just cause  can render inoperative the repressive machine of the regime.With this struggle  the South African people are beginning to build a united  democratic and anti-racist nation. Blacks  Coloreds  Indians  whites. South Africans of varying beliefs and social status  are fighting side by side for the abolition of apartheid. Even in the bantustans the people are rebelling against the regime and its collaborators  thus destroying the illusion of a fragmented and submissive South Africa.In the process of the liberation struggle  the ANC has been the catalytic force in the struggle for the abolition of apartheid. It has been able to sustain the burning torch of the liberation struggle for the fulfillment of the principles enshrined in the Freedom Charter. The ANC's cause has become one that is embraced by all nationalist organizations  be they political  trade-unionist or religious.The commitment of the South African people to the struggle for their liberty grows all the time. Against this strong determination of the South African people to free themselves from racist oppression  the apartheid regime throws its murderous machine. Thus  in the last two years thousands of men and women  young and old  have been imprisoned  tortured  banned or assassinated.Those patriots and martyrs exemplify the courage of a people that no longer fears the regime's repressive apparatus. Facing armored cars and bullets with bare hands  the South Africans are deciding on their country's future and are ensuring that South Africa will be free. I should like once again to express our solidarity with those heroic people and with their struggle.The struggle of the South African people for liberty  equality  justice and democracy is paralleled by the struggle of the Naaibian people for the realization of their inalienable right of self-determination and independence. Their struggle enjoys the unconditional support of the People's Republic of Mozambique.Twenty years have elapsed since this Organization terminated South Africa's Mandate over Namibia. In the course of those years we have adopted numerous declarations and resolutions either demanding the withdrawal of South Africa from the Territory of Namibia or condemning South Africa's refusal to abide by the decisions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.Just a few days ago the fourteenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to the question of the independence of Namibia  was held. He noted with regret that the United Nations has once again been prevented from unanimously adopting effective measures against South African colonialism. He also noted with dismay that despite professions of agreement on this fundamental question of Namibia's independence  some of us remain indifferent to the continued imprisonment  torture and massacre of the Namibian people by the Pretoria regime. These parties persist in making Namibia's independence conditional on the withdrawal of Cuban internationalist troops. They question the legitimacy and justness of the armed liberation struggle the people of Namibia have been compelled to wage. What other possible avenues are open to colonized peoples when oppressive regimes are indifferent or  as in the present case  when a regime challenges the international community as a whole? What alternatives are left to the Namibian people when the colonial regime defies United Nations resolutions to which it has agreed and challenges the international community  when it is unwilling to accept the dialog that would lead to the genuine independence of the Territory  when it arrests  tortures and massacres the people of Namibia and when it turns the ' Territory into a prison where every ten inhabitants are under the permanent control of one soldier? There is neither moral nor religious justification for demanding greater patience of these people.In the history of the struggle for independence the people of Namibia are not the first to tread the path of armed struggle. Peoples of Europe  Asia  America and Africa duly represented here affirmed their right to independence through armed struggle. Europe  weapons in hand  fought against Hitler's occupation and fascism. The People's Republic of Mozambique is itself a product of armed struggle for national liberation.Given the intransigence of the illegal regime of Ian Smith and the non-compliance by some States with the sanctions imposed by our Organization  Zimbabwe would not have acceded to independence and become a full-fledged Member of the United Nations had it not waged armed struggle.Namibia is former German colony that should have acceded to independence in the 1960s  as did Tanganyika  Burundi  Togo  Rwanda and Cameroon. Historical facts prove that the question of Namibian independence has nothing to do with the situation prevailing in Angola. It was still a Portuguese colony with Portuguese troops on its soil when South Africa declared the annexation of South West Africa. Eight years before the independence of Angola the United Nations established the Council for Namibia to administer the Territory until independence. Pretoria opposed that process. In 1973 the Security Council  by a unanimous vote and with the acquiescence of South Africa  adopted its resolution 435 (1978). Cuban troops were already in the sovereign territory of Angola  and neither South Africa nor any other Western country raised that issue as being an impediment to the Territory's independence. We recall that other arguments were advanced by the racist South Africans. It is only after all those arguments had been overcome that South Africa and this or that other country raised the false pretext of the presence of Cuban forces.Pretoria is thus blocking the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). It is contrary to ethics and to international law to link the independence of any people to issues extraneous to that people's country and concerning which they do not have the power of intervention or decision. Today as yesterday the purpose of South Africa's maneuvers with respect to Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is to preserve the colonial occupation of Namibia and to prevent the international community from concentrating its attention on the total elimination of apartheid.The obstinate attitude of Pretoria is possible only thanks to the support and complicity of certain Western countries which allow the South African authorities to buy time and create the conditions for undermining the unity of the Naiaibian people and destroying the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  its sole authentic representative.We must reiterate here our rejection of linkage and reaffirm that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) remains the sole acceptable basis for a negotiated solution of the problem. It must be implemented immediately and unconditionally.When one talks of apartheid  one speaks of the aggression constantly perpetrated by South Africa against the independent countries and peoples of southern Africa. One speaks of armed banditry and organized terrorism that are the preferred instrument of the racist regime in its political and economic destabilization of the countries of southern Africa. South Africa's is a strategy for regional domination that seeks to turn our countries into docile instruments of apartheid.Part of the territory of Angola is under racist occupation. With the objective of consolidating its aggression against and occupation of the sovereign territory of the People's Republic of Angola  the Pretoria regime protects and renders all forms of military assistance to the puppet bands of UNITA. We vigorously condemn this aggression against the People's Republic of Angola  a full-fledged Member of our Organization  and we demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of South African troops from Angola.The People's Republic of Mozambique has not been spared from this aggressive and bellicose policy of destabilization. Through armed bandits  the Pretoria regime is waging a veritable undeclared war against our country. That war is translated into terrorist acts such as the systematic destruction of communal villages  schools  hospitals  farms and sugar and tea factories. The terrorists  in the pay of Pretoria  cruelly assassinate farmers  foreign technicians  students  nurses  priests  nuns and clerical members of several religious denominations.As an example  it is estimated that overall destabilization since 1975 has resulted in the destruction of about 500 schools  leaving 90 000 students without classes; 800 shops have been destroyed and put out of operation  with serious' effects on agricultural marketing; one in every 10 health units has been sacked.Those are just a few instances of the i rap act of the external aggression against Mozambique. Our Government has assessed the direct effects of this undeclared war at more than $US 4 billion. The estimate does not include the indirect effects of the paralysis of production and the strangling of the distribution  transport and shipment system. Nor does it include the cost of rehabilitating the economic and social infrastructures that have been destroyed.These acts of terrorism against the People's Republic of Mozambique give concrete effect to a strategy conceived outside our country. Only a plan engendered by external forces could conceive of such cruelty  such great destructive fury and such a total absence of the most elementary national and human sentiments.We are witnessing maneuvers by Pretoria and other imperialist circles to transfer the operational bases of the armed bandits to countries other than South Africa  with a view to extending the conflict between the peoples of the region and apartheid to relations among certain African States.We have frequently reaffirmed our vigorous condemnation of terrorism. We are concerned about the fact that members of terrorist groups that sow death and destruction in Mozambique enjoy the support and public complicity of some Western countries  countries that proclaim themselves to be champions of the struggle against terrorism.The southern African experience teaches us that apartheid is an intrinsically violent and bellicose regime that refuses solutions through dialog and a negotiated solution to the conflict between it and the people of the region.Solutions proposing the abolition of apartheid have had no response from the authorities in Pretoria. That is the reason why the Pretoria regime imprisons the genuine leaders of the South African people and imposes a state of emergency  refuses to negotiate with the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO); and dares to violate the agreements and commitments that should bind the regime to put an end to its bellicose policy in its relations with the neighboring countries.In the history of the diplomatic struggle aimed at persuading the Pretoria regime to abandon its racist policies  the Western countries themselves have met with South Africa's intransigence. The international community has arrived at a consensus that the apartheid system has no mechanisms of self-correction and that it cannot be reformed. In that respect  may I quote the following said by President Samora Machel:""There is no democratic apartheid. There is no humane apartheid. There is no peaceful apartheid. Apartheid is the negation of justice  equality  social interaction. It is an institutionalized expression of the violation of every human right. Apartheid  like colonialism  cannot be reformed. Apartheid  like colonialism  must be eradicated.""The so-called reforms heralded by the apartheid regime  under the slogan ""adapt or die""  are nothing but attempts to deceive the people of South Africa and international public opinion as well as to appease the popular revolt and thus safeguard and perpetuate the supremacy of the white minority.The Pretoria regime has already shown itself to be insensitive to persuasion through dialog conducive to a speedy end of the system. As we stated at the Paris International Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  certain Western countries that continue to refuse to contemplate effective measures against South Africa should tell us what to do when they say no to violence  no to sanctions  no to pressures; and South Africa tells us: no to dialog. These countries should show us the road to take in view of the failure of the pseudo-reformist movement undertaken by the racist regime itself. The arguments that sanctions would hurt the black South Africans the most and would affect the economy of the countries of the region are not consistent.In South Africa nothing can be worse than death itself. Death and murder are daily occurrences there. Even corpses are riddled with bullets on their way to the cemetery. Mourners are also shot at and end up being corpses themselves to be buried. That is one of the reasons why the South African people call for sanctions as a means to shorten their suffering.Addressing the issue of the effects of the sanctions on the neighboring countries  the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique Mr. Samora Moises Machel  told the Summit Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in Harare:""In reality. South Africa has applied undeclared sanctions  since 1975  against countries of the region  apart from the destruction caused by aggression"".While South Africa considers the application of sanctions against it as immoral  it has none the less applied sanctions against the States neighboring it. The apartheid regime has systematically destroyed communication and transportation systems that ensure the economic life of the countries of the region.By sabotaging  through the armed bandits under its command  access to the Mozambican ports of Maputo  Beira and Nacala and the Angolan port of Lobito  South Africa aims at impeding the economic emancipation of the peoples of southern Africa that at present is being undertaken by the Southern African Development Co-ordinating Conference. In this context  the losses caused by the apartheid regime up to 1985 to the States members of the Southern African Development Co-ordinating Conference are estimated at $US 10 billion.Apartheid is a crime against humankind and therefore must be eradicated. The elimination of apartheid demands that the whole international community take effective  concerted and forceful measures.I reiterate here the appeal we have on various occasions addressed to all Member States to denounce  condemn and fight by all means the South African bellicose policies; to restate their moral  diplomatic and material support for the African National Congress (ANC) and the other democratic forces in South Africa that are struggling for a just and democratic society; to fight the armed banditry and State terrorism that are devastating our region and demand that South Africa henceforth terminate its support of terrorists; to provide concrete multifarious assistance to the front-line States  particularly Angola and Mozambique  so that those two front-line States may strengthen their defense capability and safeguard their independence  national sovereignty and territorial integrity and ensure the good fractioning of the port and railway systems vital to the economies of the hinterland States.The twenty-second Submit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of Africa) Unity  held in Addis Ababa in July  and the eighth Summit of the Non-Aligned Countries  held in Harare this month  adopted two special declarations on southern Africa. In them the Heads of State and Government reiterated their commitment and determination to struggle for the establishment of freedom and justice in South Africa and in Namibia through the total dismantling of apartheid. They expressed the support of the two Organizations for the demands of the Commonwealth countries contained in the Commonwealth Agreement on southern Africa.The Heads of State and Government of the two Organizations adopted concrete measures to be implemented  inter alia the following""  first  to exert pressure on the South African regime to bring it to change its policies; secondly  to support the people of South Africa and Namibia in their struggle against apartheid and the front-line and other States of southern Africa in their endeavors to reduce their dependence on racist South Africa.We appeal to the Member States of the Oil the Nations to support and fully implement those declarations.In the Maghreb region  the Sahraoui people have been struggling for the past 10 years for reaf fir nation of their right to self-determination and independence. That is a right enshrined in the Charter of our Organization  and it has been constantly reaffirmed year after year. The efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General with a view to finding a negotiated solution for the Sahraoui conflict cannot but be considered positive. It is our strong desire that these efforts may lead to direct negotiations between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front in fulfillment of the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity  the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations.We express our solidarity with the Palestinian people  led by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  in their struggle towards the achievement of legitimate and inalienable rights  including the right to create a free  independent and sovereign State. We demand the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories and strict respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States of the region  in particular Lebanon.The ongoing fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq  two Member States of our Organization  is a matter of great concern. The resolutions of the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations reflect a strong expression of the will of the international community to assist in bringing about an end to this war. We appeal to the two parties to the conflict to abide by them.The people of East Timor continue to struggle heroically against foreign occupation aid for respect for their inalienable right to self-determination and independence. We commend the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the search for a just solution compatible with the true aspirations of the East Timor people. We invite the parties involved  Indonesia in particular  to implement the resolutions of our Organization. We warmly greet FRETILIN  which has been able to keep alive the flame of the liberation struggle of the Maubere people. We reiterate our unflinching solidarity with FRETILIN.On the Korean peninsula  we support the efforts and proposals of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of the Korean nation. We reject the idea of two Koreas. The international community must make every effort to ensure that a united Korea will be admitted as a Member cf our Organization in the near future.The conflicts in Central America must end with a solution that respects the independence and sovereignty of the peoples of the region. We condemn the acts of terrorism perpetrated against the defenseless population  and we call for an immediate end to the interference in the internal affairs of Nicaragua. In this context  we hope that the findings of the International Court of Justice will be respected.The People's Republic of Mozambique pays special attention to  and regards as very important  the question of the trans for nation of the Indian Ocean in to a zone of peace free of nuclear weapons in the context of resolution 2832 (XXVI) of the General Assembly  we are concerned by the presence of foreign military bases in the region since they constitute a threat to regional peace and security. We therefore reaffirm our total support for the convening of a United Nations conference on the Indian Ocean. We reject every attempt aimed at postponing sine die the holding of such a conference.This year having been declared the International Year of Peace  the attention of humanity continues to be directed to the question of disarmament. General and complete disarmament  in particular nuclear disarmament  stems from humankind's need to preserve life on our planet  to guarantee its own survival. It is a task of paramount importance that must be undertaken by the entire human race. Weconsider it to be urgent that all States  in particular the nuclear Powers  collectively and individually take positive and concrete measures conducive to total disarmament.Only a realistic and responsible attitude on the part of all States will enable us to guarantee security and tranquility for every nation in the world and to establish a peaceful  prosperous and happy future for succeeding generations.We wish to commend the efforts undertaken by certain States or groups of States in support of nuclear disarmament. We commend the unilateral moratorium undertaken by the USSR in the field of nuclear testing  which is a demonstration of its willingness to move towards nuclear disarmament.For the People's Republic of Mozambique  disarmament does not only mean saving humanity from total annihilation but also enabling nations to tread the path of development and prosperity.The spending of financial  material and human resources for military purposes is contrary to the aspirations of the people to economic and social development. we cannot accept the present situation  in which roughly 32 million is spent each minute cm the manufacture or arms  while at the same time 30 children die of hunger  disease and malnutrition. It runs counter to human solidarity for military expenditures to be 25 times as great as the total sum available for assistance to developing nations.Under development  as a negation of the legitimate right of the peoples to development  constitutes a threat to world peace and security. We therefore consider important the international community's commitment to eliminate the ever-widening gap between developed and developing nations.The international community warmly welcomed the decision of the United Nations General Assembly proclaiming 1986 the International Year of Peace. In pursuance of that decision  various initiatives have been undertaken around the world with a view to educating mankind to cherish  defend and preserve peace.The people and Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique have associated themselves with the international community  through nationwide celebrations  in this universal exercise of reflection on and campaigning for peace.With this in mind  a national committee was established to co-ordinate a vast Program to promote the objectives of the International Year of Peace. In the same context an international seminar on peace was held in Maputo in July.The response of the People's Republic of Mozambique to the declaration made by the General Assembly at the fortieth session stems from the will of our people and State to live in peace and to contribute to the easing of world tensions and conflicts.In Mozambique  as in southern Africa as a whole  peace continues to be the main aspiration of men  women and children  and of the young and old of all races  creeds and social levels. It is a dream that everyone dearly loves and deeply cherishes.In this regard  I should like to fulfill a pleasant duty by bringing to the attention of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  a message - an appeal - by a group of children from my country who represent millions of others who long for a peaceful world. Those children are preoccupied with the present  but above all  with the future - the future of humankind. Those children addressed to me  in my capacity as Chairman of the co-ordinating committee for the celebrations of the International Year of Peace  the following letter:""The earth is the home that was given us to live in  to love and to suffer in. To destroy it would mean destroying all its inhabitants. In other words  it would as if we were left without a home  forced to sleep in the open. Worse still*  its destruction would mean the end of all of us who inhabit this marvelous planet.Unfortunately  we are at the beginning of that end. We are at the brink of this catastrophe  this holocaust  this monstrous crime.We are new like a grenade just before the moment of detonation. We are like a gunpowder keg  ready to explode.We  human beings  are bringing closer our own end. We  human beings  are setting the day of final judgment. We kill  assassinate  loot  destroy...We channel our intelligence into the production of weapons rather than the promotion of health  education  science and beneficial  technology. Today  the earth is nothing but a mountain of dung  and we its worms. Hunger  misery  war  destruction...Our planet is suffering from a disease whose cure only we  the human species  can diagnose.And to do so would not be difficult: we would need only mutual understanding. ...Love of children  flowers  men and ourselves.Love of our existential being  respect for the world that shelters us. But in the midst of so many minds uniquely devoted to destruction  there are people who still believe in the future  who still have faith in the human capacity to build and to safeguard the good.Amidst the exploding bombs  there are still those who dream of establishing peace and making this marvelous planet a quiet place for humanity to live. ""In the midst of such meanness and injustice  there is still hope of saving the flowers  the fields  and the children ... and of giving them all possible love. Of guaranteeing them a secure  comfortable and pleasant place to live. He are proud to know that we belong to that group. Even though we are living in a coin try suffering the consequences of meanness  war  assassinations and hunger resulting from destruction  we hope one day to see the Mozambican people living their daily lives in tranquility.lb see a child  in the city  in the countryside  in the communal village  walking calmly to school  without showing in its face signs of fear that it may not return home ... or return and not find its parents.We are privileged to live in a country where teaching comes from men who have fought  still fight and will always fight for peace  for what is good. Who have established and preserve equality  fraternity  justice and love. ... And if war exploits are still a daily happening in our lives  this due to the mean character of human beings without spirit  without soul  without the least human sentiment  who are bent purely and simply on destruction. However  history has taught us that the just will prevail. Those who value peace  justice and love will win. We shall win.For our party and State  for all of us  peace-loving children  the year 1986 is of the highest significance in our struggle. Because it is  as is well known  the International Year of Peace. In prompt response to the United Nations  our country dedicated a week of celebrations in support of peace. This response to the appeal by the United Nations on the part of our Party and State shews the extent of their concern with the problem of peace and the maintenance of peace  we are a group of youngsters who also agreed to contribute to the International Year of Peace as testimony to our support for the United Nations declaration  and also in re ""Although humble  our contribution consists of two boohs  entitled Independence and Peace. That theme was born of the fact that without independence there can be no peace.The first consists of signatures of various peace-loving people  dedicated to peace.The second is a more personal way of expressing our sentiments to the world and its problems  to the permanent struggle for peace.... Both are the result of a contest on peace initiatives promoted by the United Nations and in which we are participating.He entrust the Chairman of the co-ordinating committee for the celebration of the International Year of Peace  Mr. Joaquiro Alberto Chissano  who is also a great fighter for human rights  to deliver those two volumes to United Nations Headquarters. He hope that the competent authorities at the United Nations will echo our initiative so that the rest of the world may know how much we love peace and strive for it. He also express our willingness and determination to pursue our ideals. Our initiative will not end here. He want to give birth to the spirit of love and peace and we will act accordingly. He also want to live in happiness and to transmit that happiness to the uncounted thousands of succeeding generations.That is the best way of preparing our future and of preserving the present. Everything could begin with a simple handshake. We want and love peace.

The first work  a book of 185 pages  consists of clippings of articles and pictures relating to the struggle for peace selected from various magazines and newspapers in Portuguese from various countries. This compilation includes texts selected from the works of several writers  statistical data and statements by and interviews with scientists  authors and peace-loving persons. It is the result of research and reflection on and the study of peace by children.The second work  as I have said  is of the same length and contains the signatures of several personalities  including Heads of State or Government of several countries  students and teachers  who  besides signing it  agreed to provide a written commentary on the issue of peace.In the name of the children of the People's Republic of Mozambique  I ask the Secretary-General  through you. Sir  to convey to the entire international community the sentiments they have expressed in their works.Twenty-two years ago today  on 25 September 1964  the Mozambican people  under the leadership of FRELIMO  launched the epic task of liberating the land and the people from the foreign yoke. In celebrating this date we are marking the beginning of the exercise of democracy by our people and their participation in determining the destiny of their country. At this very moment  the second general election is taking place nation-wide  which makes a reality of and consolidates the democratic  popular nature of our State.The beginning of our armed struggle for national liberation was also  for us  the beginning of the Mozambican people's contribution to the struggle for peace in our region  Africa  and the world as a whole. We have thus joined hands with the community ox nations in its efforts to build a better world.Today  25 September 1985  the People's Republic of Mozambique  an African  non-aligned  socialist country  wishes to reaffirm from this high rostrum its adherence to the United Nations Charter and its determination to struggle for the promotion of the principles and objectives enshrined therein.For this reason we say: for the liberty and independence of peoples  for democracy and equality among men and nations  for justice  for co-operation and development  for international peace and security  the struggle continues."
"93",4848,"MRT",41,1986," Sir  on behalf of President Maouya Ould Sidi Ahmad Taya and the people and Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  I wish to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at the forty-first session. We have cordial relations with your country  Bangladesh  and we are confident that your excellent personal qualities will guarantee the success of our work. I wish also to pay a tribute to the manner in which Ambassador de Pinies of Spain conducted our work during the historic fortieth session of the General Assembly.I should like also to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the tireless efforts of the secretary-General of the organization  Mr  Perez de Cuellar  on behalf of peace and international stability during the year. 1 wish him good health so that he may continue his valuable work.This session is taking place at a time when for the sake of mankind our Organization must work to the utmost to save humanity from backwardness and war and to establish peace throughout the world. The international financial and economic situation gives cause for concern. The relative improvement this year has been confined to industrialized countries and has had little favorable effect on the economies of developing countries. Consequently there is an imperative need to formulate an international strategy that will deal with the monetary  financial and economic problems that face the world. My country associates itself once again with the Group of 77 in calling on the developed countries to agree to negotiate in a constructive manner in order to arrive at a satisfactory solution to this deteriorating situation. The international community will not be able to eliminate hunger and backwardness as long as so many efforts and so much money is devoted to the arms race  particularly the nuclear-arms race  which could mean extinction for the whole of mankind. Curbing this race is an essential and necessary condition for creating a world where prosperity and peace will replace hunger  poverty and war.The year 1986 was one of reflection  analysis and study concerning the causes and effects of the international economic situation. In this context the special session on the critical economic situation in Africa held a special place. The problem of development in Africa is an important question for all. It is difficult for the advanced world to continue its growth as long as there is a continent suffering from economic backwardness where so many societies are suffering from famine. It is essential to implement the United Nations Program of Action for African economic recovery and development  and we must all work hand in hand to make resources available for that purpose.The reports of the Economic and Social Council of our Organization reveal that in Africa alone there are 185 million people that live in deserts and that 30 million people are threatened by famine. Most of those people are living in the Sahelian region of the continent. Desertification is gaining pace and has already swallowed up 65 million hectares of arable land.Mauritania is among the countries seriously affected by drought and desertification and since the beginning of the 1970s there has been a continuing and steady deterioration of its economy  based on agriculture and livestock rearing  by which the majority of its citizens used to support themselves. The result has been a mass migration from the country to the towns.To deal with this situation  which has been exacerbated by the crisis in the international economy  and especially the fall in commodity prices  the national leadership of our country  under President Maouya Ould Sidi Ahmed Taya  has drawn up a full-scale development plan to achieve recovery in the vital sectors of the national economy. I wish here to express our appreciation to all the friendly countries  organizations and international agencies that have given us their valuable co-operation in this project.To assure effective participation by the people in the process of national reconstruction  our citizens are getting ready today  for the first time  to choose their representatives in free municipal elections throughout the country.Our country is also making a vigorous effort to develop and promote the activities of the regional and subregional organizations that are working to improve the economic situation in the area.The economic situation in the world is a cause for serious concern  with many countries facing great obstacles to their political options and their hopes of development  and many peoples still suffering from colonization  occupation and acts of aggression. In southern Africa the apartheid regime is still pursuing a policy of violence and aggression. The international community must support fully the national struggle of the people of South Africa to end the system of apartheid  an inhumane system  and to work for the establishment of a democratic society.It is high time also to end the occupation of Namibia  and the United Nations should assume its responsibilities in supervising the process of independence of that country under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). On this occasion I wish to express our solidarity with the front-line States that face repeated acts of aggression.In the Middle East Palestine is still suffering from the displacement of its people and the denial of its national rights. The international community has a duty to assist the struggling Palestinian people to achieve its right to establish an independent State on its own soil  including holy Jerusalem  under the leadership of its sole and legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Our Organization should also work to secure the withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights and the south of our sister country of Lebanon  which suffers from an occupation designed to destroy its unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity  and prevent the achievement of a policy of national reconciliation.My country feels very distressed at the continuation of the tragic war between Iraq and Iran and at the losses inflicted by that war in terms of human lives and material destruction  as well as the daily threat to the security and stability of the whole area. We sincerely call upon both countries to cease all hostilities and seek a peaceful settlement to that war. Our Organization and the countries that have friendly relations with those two States must do their utmost to persuade them and assist them to end the war. I must express here our satisfaction with the positive response of Iraq to the various peace initiatives. The continued problem of the Sahara  north of our border  is naturally cause of grave concern to us. Mauritania  which has friendly relations with the two parties to the conflict  welcomed the contacts that were made this year within the framework of our Organization  and we hope that the desire for understanding and reconciliation between brothers will prevail over war and rivalry. The return of stability and peace to the area will open the door to establishing relations of constructive co-operation within a large  prosperous and unified Arab Maghreb.As far as the question of Afghanistan is concerned  we call for a prompt political settlement  with the withdrawal of foreign forces and with due respect for the independence and sovereignty of Afghanistan. In that context my country appreciates the good offices provided by the Secretary-General of our Organization.As far as Kampuchea is concerned  our country renews its support for the relevant General Assembly resolution and affirms the need for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from that country so that the people of Kampuchea can determine their future free from any foreign intervention.We are confident that  through dialog  the two Koreas will be able to reach a peaceful settlement in keeping with the aspirations of the Korean people.Central America is still one of the hotbeds of tension in the world. We hope that the peace efforts made by the Contadora Group will bring about the restoration of peace and stability in that important part of the world.These are but a few of the problems faced by our world today. We are confident that the world will be a better place to live in if all States respect the principles governing international relations set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.Mauritania would like to affirm its adherence to the principles of good-neighborliness  non-interference in the internal affairs of others  non-alignment  peaceful settlement of disputes  rapprochement  solidarity among peoples  and support for just causes. Through strict adherence to those vital principles my country is able today to devote its full potential to the process of national construction and to maintain friendly relations and contacts with all peace-loving countries.In spite of the characteristic insecurity and instability of the international situation in economic and political areas  we should not underestimate the progress made by the world during the past four decades  the period of our Organization's existence. The only way we can build a world of peace and security is to continue the tireless efforts made within our Organization. Man has assumed his responsibility on this earth  and his future will be determined by his efforts.As the Koran says:""That man can have nothing Rit what he strives for; That (the fruit of) his striving Will soon come in sight; Then will he be rewardedWith a reward complete."" (The Holy Koran  L III: 31-41). Peace and blessings be upon you*"
"94",4894,"MUS",41,1986," Mr. President  let me first congratulate you most warmly on your assumption of this high and distinguished office. This honor which has been bestowed on you is a tribute by the international community to your excellent personal qualities as well as your extensive diplomatic skills and experience. We are therefore confident that you will guide our deliberations during this session wisely and successfully.I also wish to thank your predecessor  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  who presided over the General Assembly during an important year for the United Nations. We are grateful for his valuable contributions to all the deliberations on issues of vital importance to the Organization.Finally  our gratitude also goes to the Secretary-General  who during the past year has continued to demonstrate his solid commitment to the pursuit of multilateralism and the goals of the United Nations.We also thank him for his continuing concern for  and his leading role in  the work of the Organization on issues which are at the very top of the agenda of the African continent.Last year during the fortieth anniversary session the international community  in an unusual display of unanimity  reaffirmed the continuing validity of the principles of the united Nations Charter. Created primarily to maintain international peace and security  the United Nations has adapted itself to cope with emerging problems and to deal with unforeseen challenges and emergencies. As an organization it has been at the centre of discussions on many of the central issues of our time  including the problems of racism  religious intolerance and the denial of human rights to a substantial number of people throughout the world. It has been instrumental in assisting many of the Members of the United Nations towards independence and in organizing the training and research needed for the development of a number of newly independent countries. It has encouraged negotiations towards the establishment of a more ecru i table international economic order and for the promotion of development and trade. It has been in the forefront of discussions on disarmament and the reduction of military budgets  and has pointed out the organic link between expenditure on armaments and the underdevelopment to which the majority of nations seem to be currently condemned.It has focused attention on the acute problems of hunger  malnutrition and famine in some countries while others are beset by problems of surpluses and overproduction. It has initiated action to respond to the aspirations of children  youth and women  to tlte needs of the aged and the disabled and to the plight of millions of refugees uprooted from their countries and scattered throughout the world. It has pointed out that indiscriminate and selfish exploitation of finite resources threatens future generations and that there is an imperative need to agree on the protection of our environment. The sea-bed and outer space have been designated for peaceful uses  free from military competition.In the light of the successes achieved in spite of the constraints under which we know the United nations to be operating  we are deeply concerned by what seems to be a concerted assault on the principles of internationalism and multilateralism. The public perception of the United Nations as an institution is conditioned by the indifference  not to say contempt  with which its resolutions are treated in certain quarters. The failure of sane States to meet obligations arising under the Charter threatens the solvency and therefore the viability of the united Nations as an Organization. The division among the permanent members of the Security Council makes it impossible for it to carry out its mandate of maintaining international peace and security as defined in the Charter.It is not surprising  therefore  that in spite of resolutions adopted by overwhelming majorities in the General Assembly it has nevertheless not been possible to achieve a breakthrough on a number of vitally important issues. Notwithstanding the considerable efforts expended by the Secretary-General over a number of years  the problems of dismembered Cyprus  of Afghanistan and of Kampuchea still remain as unresolved issues on the agenda. The conflict in Central America  given an ideological coloring  continues to escalate  threatening a potentially catastrophic confrontation. The war between Iran and Iraq  which has already  according to certain reports  claimed over a million victims  may at any moment expand to the surrounding region and quite possibly beyond.The international community is understandably concerned at the dangerous situation created by these unresolved crises. We sees in addition to be confronted by a deliberate conspiracy to make the environment we live in less secure  both for our States and for individuals. Bow else art. we to describe the alarming increase in drug abuse and drug trafficking  the escalation in terrorist violence  the denial of human rights and the proliferation of torture and other degrading punishments in many parts of the world? Dirug abuse in some countries may be merely a social disease  even if a tragically costly one. In many developing countries  however  it represents a powerful  destabilizing factor  undermining both our social and our political institutions. He therefore welcome the convening of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  scheduled to be held in Vienna in June 1987.We are also encouraged by the emphatic condemnation of terrorism in all its forms  both by the Security Council and by the General Assembly. We are sadly forced to recognize  however  that consensus on the issue at the United Nations has nevertheless failed to restrain the spread of acts of terrorism both by groups and by States.On the African continent the regime in Pretoria continues its illegal occupation of Namibia in defiance of the stated will of the international community  expressed in the Security Council  in the General Assembly and more recently by the International Conference for the Immediate Independence of Namibia and by the General Assembly at its fourteenth special session  which preceded our deliberations. In the place of the carefully worked out Security Council plan forthe independence of Namibia under resolution 435 (1978) it has installed its own puppet regime in Windhoek and proposes to link the freedom of the people of Namibia with issues which are both extraneous and irrelevant to the question. It is clear that the regime in Pretoria has never been  and is not  interested in negotiating the independence of Namibia. All the means available to the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SW&PO) to repel Pretoria's aggression are therefore wholly legitimate and justifiable.The ideologies of the Pretoria regime  basing themselves on discredited racial theories  have spawned the rationale for the mutilation and dismemberment of South Africa into so-called bantustans. The fact that the concept of apartheid and bantustans cannot withstand the inexorable economic realities of a modern industrial State has not deterred the regime from its stubborn pursuit of so-called separate development to entrench white supremacy. The policy has within the last two years alone led to more than two thousand deaths  coupled with thousands of detentions and wrongful arrests  accompanied by massive use oi! police violence and military force.The international community  including the influential economic partners of the Pretoria regime  professes revulsion at the policy of apartheid and the repression which it has engendered. In spite of recent steps in the right direction we still feel that the influential economic partners of the regime have not yet been able to bring themselves to exert the decisive economic pressure which alone may influence a change of mind in Pretoria. The failure of the policy of constructive engagement has once more demonstrated that apartheid cannot be reformed: it will have to be dismantled. Provided the necessary conditions are created by the release of political prisoners and the establishment of political freedom  allowing all parties to operate legally  apartheid may still be dismantled peacefully.However  the heightened sense of grievance and the seeding hopelessness of the black majority in South Africa in the face of the actions of the regime are making a violent and tragic conflagration in the subregion a more imminent possibility every day that decisive action by the international community is further postponed. The recent World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  echoing the increasing international consensus not only among Governments but also among ordinary people and reflecting the sentiments of such leaders as the Commonwealth group of eminent persons on the most effective means of dealing with the threats posed by apartheid  concluded that such means should include especially the application of comprehensive mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Those measures are probably the last recourse open to the international community to prevent a bad situation from becoming worse. We remain convinced that the key to peaceful change in South Africa rests with its major economic partners  which by taking concrete and effective measures could ensure the avoidance of general civil strife and unnecessary loss of human life.Another issue high on the African agenda is the prevailing economic crisis in Africa. That this crisis is also of great relevance to the whole community of the United Nations was demonstrated by the convening of a special session of the General Assembly earlier this year  the first special session ever devoted to the economic problems of one single region. We welcome the mutual commitments of both the African States and the international community to work together on reforms in a spirit of genuine partnership. It is important to note that while the African States have recognized that some of their economic policies needed to be reformed  the international community has also accorded due importance to the improvement of the external environment  which has not favored Africa's economic performance prospects. He wish to stress here that in our view one of the most significant results of the special session was that both sides committed themselves to co-operate in a spirit of genuine and equal partnership. Too often in the past Africa has had solutions imposed on it  on the implicit assumption that those that offer aid somehow know better. Such attitudes  as we now realize  have led to great waste of efforts and resources on both sides  and in a way have even retarded development. Still  those attitudes were not altogether absent from the deliberations at the special session as rival economic recipes inspired by antagonistic ideologies were proposed each as being more effective than the other in dealing with Africa's problems. Africa has already shown that it can work out its own solutions  based on a realistic appraisal of the critical situation and its causes  by adopting the Priority Program at the Organization of African Unit summit in July 1985.We therefore regret that unfortunately the implications of the Priority Program's content could not be accepted in their entirety by Africa's partners. The international community was unable or unwilling to announce a firm commitment to meeting Africa's request for additional resources in aid and debt relief for implementation of the Program.Underdevelopment in Africa or elsewhere in the third world  with the attendant low prospects for economic growth  threats to food security and widespread unemployment  are increasingly being considered as growing non-military threats to international peace and security and stability in international relations. Relatively too little of the world's resources is spent to promote the development process as compared to expenditure devoted to armaments. Global military expenditures are now between four and five times the levels during the Second World War in real terms  which  staggeringly  represents 25 times the total amount of official development assistance to developing countries. While we have been calling for disarmament for several years  we must now place increasing emphasis on the nexus between disarmament and development  on the policies and co-operative efforts of the international community to ensure much resources freed through the disarmament process are properly appropriated for development purposes.There are a number of other important policy measures which the international community  and in particular the industrialized countries  should consider to create a more favorable global environment that would help relieve the poor from external constraints that aggravate their situation. In the past several years protectionist sentiments and measures have intensified in industrial countries and non-tariff barriers have proliferated in markets that are of present or potential interest to developing countries  such as textiles and clothing  steel and agricultural products markets. The developing countries  which have endeavored to implement the policy of ""trade not aid"" to achieve maximum economic independence  find themselves thwarted by protectionist walls around those same countries as profess the policy of weaning developing countries from external assistance.The next round of multilateral negotiations by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) must therefore focus on non-tariff barriers much more than in the past if it is to produce meaningful results  since those barriers have become the most important and pervasive obstacles to trade today. The GATT institutions should also be reformed in order to strengthen the international trading system and help reduce the arbitrary and discriminatory protectionist measures of developed countries against the exports of developing countries. Because the same developing countries are also debtors which need to run trade surpluses to service their debts  the growth of world trade volumes  unimpeded by protection practices  is essential for their development process. Many developing countries enter the second half of this decade faced with the proxies of restoring domestic growth within what is for some an unfavorable external environment. Lower interest rates and declining oil prices perhaps accorded some relief last year and in the earlier half of this year  but they have been counterbalanced by the slower growth of world trade  deteriorating terns of trade and higher trade barriers. In addition  net long-tern capital inflows have maintained their downward trend. In fact  developing countries were making a net transfer of financial resources to the developed countries in 1984. Last year total interest payments on external public and private long-tera debt exceeded net long-tern inflows by $22 billion.Debt relief is therefore taking on a new urgency for developing countries  especially in Africa  in view of its critical economic situation  as debts constitute a severe and restrictive drag on their economic recovery. Intervention in financial markets has been necessary to avert a catastrophe  although the general approach has been on a case-by-case basis. However  such piecemeal solutions are inadequate as they are dependent on certain conditions which are not wholly guaranteed  such as rapid global economic growth. The industrialized countries are still reluctant to take measures to stimulate the growth necessary as a lever for stronger international revival. Unless a more systematic approach is implemented  the probability of a collapse will become more likely and debtors will continue to face slow or zero-growth consumption and investment  leading to political and economic dangers for both creditors and debtors.Although  as we have stressed  the non-military threats resulting from political instability  which is itself the consequence of harsh and desperate living conditions  we must not forget that the first and foremost danger to international peace and security remains the massive amount of arms  particularly the nuclear arms stockpiles of the two super-Powers. The dangers of the nuclear-arms peace continue to be dominated by the absurd logic that more is better  when only a fraction of the present level of nuclear armament would be sufficient to wipe out all meaningful life as we know it. Outer space is quickly becoming the next major theater for super-Power rivalry in the achievement of military supremacy.There is now almost unanimous agreement in this body and elsewhere that by far the most direct and understandable way of stopping and then reversing this trend is through a mutual pledge to freeze the development  production and deployment of further nuclear weapons as the prelude to negotiation on their reduction and  it is to be hoped  their eventual elimination.At a lower level  though not less crucial to those directly concerned  are those dangers to international peace and security posed by regional tensions and conflicts  which are almost always the unfortunate result of the modern-day pursuit of rival imperial ambitions  which are often portrayed as the defense of purported national interests. The majority of countries so affected are developing countries  which have attempted to eliminate such rivalries in their neighborhood so as to be able to get on with their main task of peaceful economic development.The countries of the Indian Ocean region  for example  have for more than 10 years now  in an attempt to diminish the dangers posed by super—Power rivalry  endeavored to establish a zone of peace in the region. Although the General Assembly's Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace (resolution 2832 (XXVI)) is now 15 years old  its implementation still appears as remote as ever. The Colombo conference on the Indian Ocean  which will constitute a major step towards the early achievement of the objectives of the Declaration  has been repeatedly postponed by a long series of obstructionist maneuvers by certain States members of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean. He strongly support the call  made by the 101 leaders of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  who met recently at Harare  for the conference to be held not later than 1988  with the full and active participation of all the permanent members of the Security Council and the major maritime users.In the same context of the objectives of the Declaration  we note with satisfaction the renewed unanimous support of the non-aligned Member states as well as the backing of other members of the Assembly for our claim to sovereignty ever the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia. The decolonization of Mauritius will not be complete and its territorial integrity restored in til the Chagos Archipelago is returned to Mauritius. Moreover  the continuous expansion of the military base on Diego Garcia has led to increased rival military activity in the Indian Ocean region  thus seriously compromising the objectives of the Declaration of th-a General Assembly.The Middle East  a region that has not known peace for the past 40 years  remains one of the world's worst trouble-spots  having the potential for a ranch wider conflagration  with dire consequences world-wide. At the heart of the Middle East turmoil is  as the overwhelming majority of countries has recognized  the diaspora of the Palestinian people and the denial of justice to its cause.The question of Palestine remains one of the most enduring and tragic anomalies of our times. It has remained on the agenda of the General Assembly since the founding of the United Nations  and a just and equitable solution still eludes it. Such a solution can be Sound only within the framework of a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East situation  based on Israel's total and unconditional withdrawal from all the territories occupied since 1967 and the restoration of all the rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to return to its homeland  the right to self-determination and the right to establish its own independent and sovereign State on its national territory. A major step towards such a solution would be the speedy convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  with the participation ox all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The resolution of divisions within countries is as important as the settlement of conflicts between coin tries for the maintenance of global peace and security. The division of the Korean nation has long constituted an element of instability in the region. It is a question which should be resolved speedily by direct negotiations  without external interference. An even more compelling reason for resolving this protracted issue is the pain and suffering of thousands of families whose lives have been disrupted by separation.In our search for solutions to the numerous regional and global problems of our times  the United Nations has  and should have  a primary role to play. To say that we must strengthen the provisions of the Charter to enable the United Nations better to attain its objectives is to state the obvious. Yet there are forces bent on manipulating the Organization for their own aids  to the detriment of the interests of the world co ran unity. States which do not favor certain Programs have been withholding their proportionate contributions for years  and now wholesale across-the-board withholding is envisaged. We should not accept any proposal which would attempt  indirectly or otherwise  to change the Charter objectives or weaken the role of the legislative organs. This Organization is the only world body whose membership represents practically the whole of mankind  based on the principle of sovereign equality. It is the only world body where weaker nations have a chance to voice their feelings and where they can find the moral checks and balances against encroachment on their hard-won independence and sovereign existence. It is our hope that as the Organization enters its fifth decade vigilance and determination will safeguard the integrity of its Charter. There is no better or more viable alternative for the protection of international peace and security."
"95",4931,"MWI",41,1986," On behalf of ray delegation  I join all those who have spoken before me in offering ray sincere congratulations to Mr. Choudhury  of Bangladesh  on his election as President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. My delegation is aware of the outstanding diplomatic skills and vast experience which he brings with him to this high office. I am  therefore  confident that under his guidance the Assembly will be able to deal successfully with all matters that come before it. I should like to assure him of my delegation's fullest support and co-operation at all times.I also take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Jaime de Pinies  of Spain  for the outstanding way in which he presided over the last session of the General Assembly. The fortieth session of the General Assembly was historic  marking as it did the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. Thus  apart from guiding the Assembly in deliberating over the important items on its agenda  Mr. de Pinies also presided over the celebrations marking the fortieth anniversary and the special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. He accomplished all these tasks most successfully. In congratulating him we also want to express to him our best wishes for his future endeavors.  My delegation is pleased to see Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our Secretary-General  back at work and in good health after his recent hospitalization. Allow me also to express my Government's appreciation for the personal efforts of the Secretary-General  as well as for the work undertaken by his office during the past 12 months in the cause of international peace. While it is true  of course  that areas of tension and conflict in the various regions of the world remain  I believe it is equally true that it is because of the Secretary-General* s initiatives  as well as his personal intervention  that many of these conflicts have been prevented from escalating to more dangerous levels; and  in some cases  inter-State tensions have also been prevented from developing into open conflicts. My Government has also noted with satisfaction the Secretary-General's continuing efforts in seeking to promote international co-operation not only in the political sphere but also in the fields of social and economic development.  I should like to assure the Secretary-General and his staff of the continued support of the Malawi Government.My Government was among those that welcomed the summit meeting last year between the leaders of the two super-Powers. We welcomed it because we hoped that it might lead to an easing of the atmosphere of tension and reduce the mistrust which had built up as a result of the absence of dialog between the two leaders. Reports that the discussions between them were cordial and constructive ware encouraging. It was also encouraging to learn that they would meet again in 1986. Thus it appeared that the year 1986  which the General Assembly had designated the International Year of Peace  would start off on a very positive note. Until last week  however  it seemed that our hopes had been misplaced  as confrontation appeared to replace dialog. We therefore welcome the news of the agreement to resume dialog and we look forward to the results of another summit meeting between the two leaders.We welcomed the summit meeting last year because we hoped that it might not only lead to a resumption of suspended arms reduction negotiations between the two super-Powers themselves but also give momentum to arms reduction and general disarmament talks which had been going on in other forums.We believe that there is a correlation between international tension and conflict and the relationship between the two super-Powers. That is why my delegation is convinced of the need for the two Powers to continue talking positively to each other. However  dialog between the super-Powers cannot by itself guarantee international peace and security. There ought to be a willingness and a determination on the part of all countries in the world - large and small  powerful and weak - also to cultivate habits and actions that are conducive to the maintenance of peace and security.In this regard I am pleased to inform the Assembly that as part of its contribution towards achieving those ends the Government of Malawi recently acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty.My delegation believes that a halt  or even just a significant slow-down  in the arms race would not only release vast financial resources but also enable the countries concerned to redirect the invaluable technical knowledge and capital now employed in manufacturing the vehicles of destruction. The resources so released could be better used in exploiting and developing the enormous natural and human resources that remain untapped in the world  particularly in the developing countries.Just as Malawi believes that disarmament is important for the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security  so too it believes that adherence to the universal principles of respect by States for each other's sovereignty and non-interference in one another's internal affairs is vital.In our view the use of coercion in any form is unacceptable  as is the use of military force-in solving inter-State differences  for we do not believe that the sovereignty of a country should depend on its military and economic power or on its size.It is sad to note that there are still areas in the world where people continue to be denied the fundamental right to self-determination and the right to choose their own leaders and their preferred system of government. They continue to be denied those rights by external forces that have assumed for themselves the power to determine for others how  and by whom  they shall be governed.My Government continues to support the principle of the right of self-determination for all peoples. We believe every people has a right to choose its own leader and system of government. We therefore continue to follow the Secretary-General's efforts in the search for a solution to the problem of Cyprus  whose Greek and Turkish communities remain divided as a result of foreign intervention. It is our hope that a solution will be found which satisfies the concerns and aspirations of both sides  so that both communities may once more direct all their energies and resources to developing their country  free from fear of external interference.Similarly  we have followed moves to secure self-determination for other countries in other regions of the world still under foreign occupation. In this regard the Malawi Government has continued to follow with sadness developments in our own region. For example  the question of Namibia is a matter of great disappointment. Twenty years after the ruling by the International Court of Justice on the constitutional status of Namibia and eight yeara after the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the people of that Territory have not yet seen their aspirations to independence and self-determination fulfilled. We remain convinced that that resolution provides the most reasonable basis for a lasting and just solution of this problem. We note with satisfaction that the recent special session of the General Assembly on Namibia reaffirmed the validity of resolution 435 (1978) and we therefore call on all the parties concerned to implement the resolution without unnecessary delay.We have witnessed the sad and futile determination by the authorities in South Africa to enforce  at the cost of great human suffering and loss of life  a principle which has been universally declared to be morally unacceptable. Malawi has repeatedly and publicly declared its abhorrence of apartheid. We can find neither religious nor moral justification for a system under which one section of a society  let alone a Government  denies another the right to equal social  economic and political opportunity solely on the basis of color and race.Malawi believes that all South Africans - blade  white and brown - belong together and have a common destiny. Together  they can have  and build  a non-racial society and a corn try that is very successful economically. In spite of the developments in recent months  we believe that there is still an opportunity not only for the people of South Africa to have their nation from further suffering but also to find a solution that will bring peace  justice and a healing of wounds. Such a solution can still be achieved if all parties can sit together and work out a formula for equitable sharing of political power.In the Middle Bast the situation continues to give cause for concern. Peace continues to be elusive. Various recent initiatives aimed at resuscitating dialog between the various parties have either been stillborn or have foundered on the rocks of the intractable positions of the parties concerned. Meanwhile  one has again begun to hear calls to arms.The issues at the core of the Middle East question are well known to all Members of the Assembly  and there is no need for me to repeat them here. I merely want to say that  in our view  no solution to the problem can bring about a lasting peace that does not take account of the legitimate needs and aspirations of all the various peoples in the region. It is clear that no solution imposed on the parties concerned has any chance of success. Malawi continues to value the principle of contact and dialog which  in our view  is the best way towards finding lasting solutions. This necessarily requires that the parties to a dispute be prepared to listen to each other and to have a genuine spirit of give and take.At a time when many developing countries  particularly in Africa  continue to grapple with problems created by natural calamities over which they have no control  such as drought  my Government has been encouraged by the international goodwill demonstrated by the relief aid provided by the world's countries both individually and collectively  to the affected areas. But more important has been the recent realization that ability to deal with such phenomena requires long-term strategies that aim not only at alleviating the results of immediate disasters but also at enhancing the economic development of the developing countries so that they are better able to meet such predicaments on their own. We welcome that development.In this context I should like to refer to the General Assembly's special session on the critical economic situation in Africa held here in May 1986. When the idea of holding such a special session was first mooted  it seemed to have been viewed by some with much cynicism. Nothing such  apparently  was expected to come of it. Indeed  even as the session was in progress one heard much about how nothing was being achieved. However  by the end of the special session it was clear that success had bees* achieved.The success of the special session certainly cannot be measured by hew many millions of dollars the international community undertook to give towards resolving Africa's economic crisis. Rather  it must be measured  in the first instance  by the commitment  which was so clearly expressed in the report of the special session  by the international community to give all assistance towards implementation of the African Priority Program for Economic Recovery (APPER).APPER stands as a testimony to our leaders' recognition of past shortcomings and to their genuine desire to adopt mare pragmatic economic strategies for the future. We are convinced that Africa is ready to shoulder its responsibilities and to play its role fully in the implementation of APPER.My delegation would be remiss were it not to take this opportunity to express here our appreciation of the part played by the Secretary-General and the Secretariat  not only in ensuring the convening of the special session  but also in facilitating its success. Indeed  I should also like to express  on behalf of my delegation our appreciation of the role played by the United Nations  through its various organs  in the promotion of economic development among its developing Member states. It is for that reason that we were pleased to note the success of the meetings of the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in June and  soon after  of the Economic and Social Council.The Malawi Government is most grateful for the assistance it has received and continues to receive from the United Nations. That assistance  together with the aid we have received from other multilateral and bilateral donors  has greatly contributed towards Malawi's development efforts. The Malawi Government is determined to eliminate the problems of hunger  disease  poverty and ignorance. I am pleased to be able to state that  with regard to hunger  Malawi has been able to achieve self-sufficiency in food. The people now grow not only sufficient food for domestic consumption but enough for strategic reserves and export.During the fortieth anniversary celebrations it was most encouraging to hear statement after statement by Heads of States and Governments  ministers and other representatives  reaffirming their faith in the United Nations. We believe that  whatever its shortcomings in certain aspects  the United Nations has been and continues to be a major force for the maintenance of international peace and security and for the promotion of development in all fields.In that context the universal declaration of faith in the United Nations had led us to expect increased support for and a strengthening of the Organization. It was therefore with much concern that we received the Secretary-General's report on the financial crisis the Organization is facing  one that threatens the ability of the Secretariat to function properly. However  delegation has noted the measures the Secretary-General has adopted to deal in the short term with the immediate effects of the financial crisis  We have also noted that a start has been made in the search for long-term solutions by the High Level Group of Intergovernmental parts appointed to review the administrative and financial functioning of the United Rations  which Group has now submitted its report.Hy delegation is pleased to note that the report of the High-Level Group will be examined during this session. However  it is our view that if there are to be positive decisions on this natter  good will and sound judgment will be needed -otherwise  the Organization's very existence will be in doubt.In this regard  Malawi  together with others  will always be ready to play its part in ensuring the survival of the United Nations  in order that it may continue its function of preserving international peace and security as well as promoting economic  social and political development in the world.The United Nations has faced other  equally serious crises in the past but has overcome them through the determined efforts of all its Members. He are convinced  therefore  that the United Nations will not only overcome the present crisis  but will emerge from it even stronger."
"96",4977,"MYS",41,1986," Let me first extend to you  Sir  my delegation's most sincere and heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. It is a source of pleasure and pride to have as President an eminent personality from a country with which Malaysia has always enjoyed warm and brotherly relations. Your unanimous election as President of this Assembly is a recognition of your skill and experience as an outstanding diplomat.It is in the same spirit that I express our gratitude to the outgoing President  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  for his invaluable contributions and the impartial and skillful way in which he conducted the fortieth session of the General Assembly. Ambassador de Pinies's presidency was also of special significance in that it coincided with the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.For the past several years we have witnessed with increasing concern the steady decline of the United Nations. Are we to stand by and watch this Organization sink into an irrelevance from which it may never recover from  or should we not act with the common objective of restoring life and meaning to the United Nations? If we are to judge by what was said by the many important and illustrious world leaders during the commemorative fortieth session held last year  we appear to be unanimous in our concern that this Organization should not be allowed to suffer a fate similar perhaps to that of its predecessor  the League of Nations. With the benefit of hindsight  we all know why the League failed and the consequences that followed. It is perhaps sobering for us to reflect upon the consequences of a United Nations that is so eroded that it becomes progressively more of a meaningless ritual for us to meet here once a year  say our piece  go back and forget about it all until the next session. Unless really constructive steps are taken to remedy the situation  this downward spiral will continue until the very existence of the United Nations is put in question. For  in the final analysis  if this Organization serves no one  why subscribe to it at all?For the majority of us the small developing nations  a world without the United Nations is almost unthinkable. In fact  many nations here owe their independence to the work of the decolonization Committee of the United Nations. To us  the United Nations transcends mere symbolism. In the United Nations lies our hope for a better tomorrow  for justice  peace and stability and for prosperity for all mankind. Therefore it is imperative that the United Nations remain relevant  its role enhanced and not made subject to the interests of individual States or blocs. Despite misgivings that some may have about the United Nations  let us not forget that the United Nations can be only what we all want it to be. The reality is that a few wealthy and powerful nations have always  in spite of charges of ""automatic majorities"" and ""extreme"" and ""useless"" resolutions  had the edge in shaping the United Nations. If the Organization falls short of expectations  the responsibility rests heavily on the shoulders of those same powerful nations  which perhaps expect the United Nations to be a creature in their own image  serving oily certain perceived ends  for certain perceived interests. To be sure  the responsibility also lies with the smaller developing nations. Considerations based purely on ideological or political lines cannot contribute to meaningful solutions. As small developing countries  we must remain sensitive to our responsibilities  just as we would wish the developed and powerful countries to base their decisions on the merits of a particular issue  governed by principles which are central to the ideals of the United Nations. There is a need for us to temper the majority we enjoy by what is relevant  practical and realistic. Most important  we should not allow ourselves to be proxies  basing our decisions on ideological attachments or bloc interests  without regard for the principles involved.There are also some among us who pay lip-service to these principles but who  when it suits them  remain strangely mute when they are trampled upon. A few among us also disregard principles  violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of weaker  smaller States  seeking recourse through arms and military power. Let us -the small nations - as Members of this Organization exercise our responsibilities with maturity  sobriety and a sense of justice and fair play.It is not coincidental that some of the nations that founded and pioneered the United Nations grew more disenchanted with this Organization in the wake of the increasing membership resulting from decolonization. It was then that talk about the ""tyranny of the majority"" and about ""automatic"" third-world majorities against the interests of certain nations began to emerge. At the same time it also became fashionable  as it were  in some quarters to malign and denigrate the United Nations with charges of ""bloated budgets"" and ""extreme"" and ""useless"" resolutions.Indeed  it is simplistic and even damaging to the Organization to pretend that the United Nations needs no improvement and could not be made more effective. Certainly  over the years some ""fat"" has accumulated which needs to be trimmed. Its efficacy must be reviewed periodically in order to enhance its role  but the motive for improving the United Nations must always be premised on the precepts enshrined in the Charter. While the United Nations appears not to have escaped the effects of a world in recession  actually to attribute the current financial crisis to late payments by Member countries would be a gross distortion of facts.The present cash-flow crisis has been the result of the withholding of regular contributions to the Organization on the one hand and an over-staffed Secretariat on the other. While we commend the efforts of the Group of 18 to reduce the staff levels in the Secretariat and to rationalize the Organization's administrative andbudgetary procedures  we cannot agree with any rationale that obligatory contributions by any Member country can be withheld in order to force the acceptance of conditions unilaterally decided by a country's own national legislature. However unpalatable existing rules and procedures may appear to be to each Member country  any effort to amend such rules must be undertaken within agreed procedures and in accordance with the system in place. Any hint or suggestion that a Member country  however big or small  could unilaterally impose conditions would only bring about difficult precedents inconsistent with the spirit and the Charter upon which the United Nations was founded. Rules and procedures built around such a basic concept of the equality of States must not be tempered with  for that is one of the fundamental pillars upon which the United Nations was established.Whatever our dissatisfaction may be with the United Nations  membership of the Organization requires us to accept certain basic principles and to operate in accordance with agreed grotsid rules. The issue is not control through majority voting rights? it is rather the time-consuming and painstaking process of seeking understanding and consensus to resolve problems that face the general membership.While we hear so ranch criticism of the ineffectiveness of the United Nations from certain quarters  those quarters remain strangely mute on some issues where the United Nations has indeed failed - failed not due to lack of trying but simply because of obstacles which render many United Nations resolutions on those issues unimplementable. Simply put  it failed because of the attitude of the big Powers.We are outraged that in spite of our efforts for so many years to bring an end to the system of apartheid in South Africa it still exists  flouting every concept and principle of human decency. None of us denies that morally what is happening in South Africa is totally indefensible; yet it exists because a few rich and powerful nations that could do most to dismantle it will not participate in any meaningful way to end this diabolical system. Those nations  while cm the one hand condemning apartheid  on the other continue to give it sustenance by refusing to abandon policies based on ""constructive engagement"" and ""gentle persuasion""  which have clearly failed; yet those same nations have been known to apply naval blockades when solving their own problems.Apartheid is a system which has institutionalized racism for the purpose of establishing and maintaining the domination of a white minority over a black majority. Recent developments in South Africa prove beyond any doubt that Pretoria will not be persuaded to abandon its policy of apartheid. Indeed  the regime is categorically and adamantly committed to maintaining and enforcing apartheid  therefore to pursue further a policy such as ""constructive engagement"" will only mean sending the wrong signals to Pretoria.The way forward now is to embark seriously on sanctions. There have been arguments from certain countries that sanctions are ineffective and will only impose economic hardships on the front-line States and worsen the situation for the blacks in South Africa. It is admitted that sanctions would not be painless for neighboring African States and for the blacks in South Africa  but surely the indignities that they have suffered for so long under apartheid are incomparably more painful? Besides  if we are really determined there is much that we can do to alleviate this suffering and bring about quicker results.The blades in South Africa and the front-line States realize what they are facing. The colonial Powers had so structured the economy of those States as to raider them completely dependent on South Africa. Retaliation by the Pretoria regime is thus easy and effective. It is made even more effective by the willingness of South Africa to sabotage lines of communication  particularly of the land-locked States. In this South Africa is being helped by rebels nurtured by certain countries.The non-aligned summit conference in Harare decided upon the setting up of a solidarity fund for southern Africa  but the support of the Western world and Japan is necessary if the aid is to have any substance or effect. During the Berlin blockade a vast airlift was organized to break the blockade  South Africa's counter-blockade must be broken in the same way and with the same determination by the rest of the freedom-loving world.Sooner or later this travesty of a Government that sits in Pretoria and its hateful apartheid policy must go. Let us all help to make it go sooner rather than lacer. Let us be determined to give all possible help by blockading South Africa and helping to ensure that supplies and aid reach the front-line States.It is time for countries which profess lofty principles and which are always ready to condemn and even subvert third-world countries for alleged suppression of freedom to practice what they preach. South Africa must be freed. Namibia must be returned to its people on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) without any ""linkage"". It is unacceptable that Namibians should be held hostage because of the so-called misdeeds of a totally different nation.The question of Palestine is another issue on which the United Nations has failed to make any impact  despite the fact that this subject has appeared regularly on the agenda almost since the founding of the Organization. Because of the failure to resolve this central issue  the whole of the Middle East region remains in a constant state of turmoil.The problem of Palestine began with the creation of Israel  at the expense of dispossession of the people of Palestine. Since Israel owes its existence to a decision taken by the United Nations in 1948  and since that decision was honored and upheld by the major Powers  it is incumbent upon those same Powers  if not upon Israel  to honor and uphold subsequent United Nations resolutions on the same issue.The clock cannot be turned back and we have to accept the reality. So  too  are the Palestinian people a reality with their own history  their own traditions  culture and national identity. It is also a reality that the Palestinians have been reduced to a nation of refugees  who  for two generations  have been born in refugee camps  hounded  persecuted  bombed and vilified.We are actually witnessing a holocaust inflicted on the Palestinian people. Israel  on the one hand  is given what amounts to carte blanche to do whatever itlikes  because of the support and protection of the super-Powers  which are in a position to frustrate any attempt by the international community to find a solution based on justice. It is obvious that in the absence of an even-handed policy on the part of the super-Powers the United Nations will be unable to act. Israel's borders will continue to expand its borders  annexing Arab lands as it wishes  and any action that Israel takes  however horrendous  will be justified in terms of safeguarding its national security.The Palestinian people  on the other hand  have no legitimate recourse  as does Israel  given the limited resources at their disposal. At the same time  they have to confront hostile news media  dominated by Zionists. The= Palestinians  therefore  unlike the Israelis  have to fight against all odds in their struggle for their rights and identity. In the process  the Palestinians have always been condemned by the world while the fact is ignored that Israel itself is a product of terrorism  that its unceasing intimidation  harassment and victimization of Arabs in the occupied territories and elsewhere is purely and simply a policy based on terrorism.While we are on the subject of terrorism  let me state categorically that my country joins the international community in condemning terrorism. It is indeed significant that the United Nations was able to adopt a resolution by consensus against terrorism. Our concern must also cover acts of terrorism by Governments. While we should not be selective in our condemnation of terrorism  let us not ignore the fact that policies such as those practiced by Israel are based on terror and invite retaliation based on the same psychology of terror. If we are to condemn and act against terrorism  let us not be selective  nor must we resort to it as a counter measure.In many of the major crises that confront the world  the majority of States are reduced to the position of bystanders  powerless to act or influence  save perhaps by our moral outrage and our pleas and appeals. Even in some cases of seemingly limited and local conflicts the hand of a greater actor is thinly veiled  adding fuel to the fire. Our inability to act is even more circumscribed when a major Power is involved and openly ignores all the basic tenets of the Charter of the United Nations. But as small developing countries we must  nevertheless  continue to raise our voices against any instances in which important principles such as the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of States are violated and ignored. He  the small nations  are all potential victims.The case of Afghanistan serves as an example. An independent  sovereign nation is invaded and occupied by one of the most powerful countries in the world. For the Soviet Union  a permanent member of the Security Council  one of the countries to which we are expected to entrust questions of world peace and security  to perpetrate such an act cannot but leave us all in a state of permanent fear. We can never accept what may happened in Afghanistan as a fait accompli. We must continue to condemn the Soviet action and that of its puppets just as the majority of the people of Afghanistan  despite the terrible odds  continue to fight and resist the aggression.Similarly  the international community should never acquiesce to Viet Nam's invasion of Kampuchea. Indeed  the international community has repeatedly affirmed its condemnation of Viet Nam  but nevertheless that country persists in its intransigence in rejecting all efforts for a peaceful solution. This is indeed an arrogant attitude  made no less so because of the firm backing that Viet Nam has been getting from a super-Power. It is ironic that Viet Nam  which was itself subjected to a long struggle against foreign domination  should now seek to impose its domination on a small  weak neighbor. Just as we stand behind the Mujahideen in Afghanistan  so too must we stand by' the people of Kampuchea in their valiant struggle. While Malaysia and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries hail the efforts of the Kampuchean resistance under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk  we have always encouraged a negotiated solution. It is in this context that we urge Viet Nam to reconsider iti rejection of the eight-point proposal put forward by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.Malaysia believes the eight-point proposal contains the elements of a constructive framework for negotiations that could lead to a comprehensive and peaceful solution inasmuch as it is based on a policy of national reconcile.nation that includes all parties. The proposal also provides for free elections in which all parties can take part. Surely this is a just and workable proposal in consonance with the principles of self-determination and of the United Nations. However  Viet Nam seems intent on rejecting everything other than its own military solution.In Central America  the super-Powers and their proxies are just as active  trying to shape governments and countries in their own images through subversion and through provoking and directing rebellions. Is the majority in this Organization wrong when it condemns such acts? If there is an ""automatic majority""  is there not also a tendency on the part of the big Powers to automatically use their brute strength when they dislike the stand of the majority.One of the many intractable issues confronting us is that of disarmament  an issue which this Organization has been grappling with for many years. It is obvious that the problem of disarmament cannot be addressed effectively unless major Powers are resolved to negotiate a halt to the proliferation and the eventual elimination of nuclear arsenals. Already we have accumulated enough nuclear devices to destroy the world. Even if we decide to dispose of them  we cannot. We have already condemned ourselves to permanent fear of radiation and destruction. Doomsday may be nearer than we think.It is indeed a horrifying prospect that the survival of mankind should be dependent on a ""balance of terror"". Malaysians ate called ""barbarians"" because we hang convicted white criminals for drug offenses  as we hang others for the same crime. What do we call people who threaten to wipe out the whole human race in fulfillment of their war strategy?The cause of peace cannot be served by wasting scarce resources on nuclear arms. If the super-Powers stop their nuclear build-up we will not ask them to spend their savings on eradicating poverty  hunger and disease. They can spend iton themselves  by all means  for even that is better than the useless manufacture of these terrible indestructible weapons.Since our last United Nations General Assembly session in 1985  the world economic situation has deteriorated tremendously. We are meeting in New York today at a time of severe adversity in the economic field for almost all developing countries. The undermining of the economies of developing countries  in recent months  is unprecedented in scope. The debt burdens of developing countries is now at is highest level while the terms of trade for us are getting worse and worse.We do not want to blame the rich countries for all our woes  but the fact remains that it is their action that is at the bottom of our unprecedented economic crisis.Let us take the national debts as an example. When the seven rich countries had trade unbalances  their solution was to force the revaluation of the yen and the deutschmark. Many countries of South-East Asia borrow yen extensively. The appreciation of the yen alone has increased Malaysia's Japanese debts by 60 per cent. Other countries are even worse off.If the problem is massive Japanese imports into North America and Europe  it would have caused less damage to the poor countries if very high import duties are imposed. But yen revaluation which has caused havoc to our economy has done nothing to limit imports of Japanese goods into North America or Europe.The developing countries all depend on commodity exports to earn foreign exchange. Now all commodities are experiencing very lew prices  some falling by more than 60 per cent. A combination of factors has brought about this across-the-board price depression.First  new technology has rendered the traditional raw materials irrelevant. Either new and cheaper materials are substituted  as when glass fibre replaces copper wire in telecommunications  or the quantities used are so much reduced that the raw material as an input is irrelevant. At the same time  new technology has also immensely increased production of raw materials.A glut situation then arises and becomes aggravated when the rich countries subsidize the production and sale of their commodities. The poor countries can never subsidize to the level of the rich and they lose all their traditional markets.If  in the past  the terms of trade were such that we had to sell more and more commodities in order to pay for less and less manufactured goods  now we cannot even sell more commodities to pay for even more expensive manufactured goods. And governments find it increasingly difficult to earn sufficient foreign currency to pay their debts.The collapse of commodity prices results in a chain reaction whereby all economic activities are slowed or forced to a standstill. As usual  it is at such times that creditors become predators.Hew then can we honestly say that the rich developed countries are not to be blamed for our economic miseries? How can we look at future meetings of the seven richest industrialized nations with equanimity?There is also at the moment an inadequate international monetary and financial system. Sovereign nations are no longer masters of their own currency. Speculators  including banks  can push currencies up or down at will. Indeed  trading in goods has been displaced by trading in currencies. The situation is anarchic  and serious-minded people must find a new monetary system that is more orderly if the problems of the debtor and creditor nations are to be resolved.In the first place  creditor countries should assist in increasing the rate of growth in the indebted countries. There should be a reduction of interest rates  stabilization of the exchange rates  reduction of budget deficits  planned recovery in the major developed countries and increasing market access for exports of developing countries.In addition  international financial institutions should provide the funds to meet the requirements of long-term development projects in developing countries besides short-term financing. It is here that the United Nations and its agencies have a major role to play.Malaysia has very recently taken the initiative in promoting economic co-operation among developing countries by hosting the Second International South-South Conference or South-South II  in Kuala Lumpur. Many third world economists  scholars and statesmen met and discussed the world economic situation and the approach towards improving the economic situation of developing countries. >3e cannot accept that the rich seven should have the exclusive right to impose their own solutions to the world's economic problems. Already their exchange rate approach has impoverished us further. An Independent Commission of the South has therefore been set up under the chairmanship of former President Julius Nyerere to examine and propose practical measures for us to take. We hope the United Nations and Member countries will help this Commission in every way possible.Malaysia wishes to join other developing countries in calling upon the developed countries to address in a just and equitable manner the various issues facing the international economy so as to ensure stable and sustained international economic growth  as well as to foster an inter nation . trading and financial system responsive to the needs of - and be of benefit to - all nations. It is in this spirit that Malaysia welcomed the recent launching of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations in Punta del Este this September.A major issue that confronts us and requires urgent attention is thei ^national drug problem. The modern-day manifestations of that threat  including the subjugation of whole nations  amplifies the need for concrete and decisive international action to overcome it. Malaysia therefore welcomes the convening of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking in June of next year. That opportunity should not be wasted  we should pool all our resources and combine all our efforts to remove this scourge that is sapping the vitality of our nations.In Malaysia  we are fully committed to combating the drug menace in all its manifestations and with every resource available to us. we have hanged and will continue to hang pushers and traffickers in accordance with our laws  irrespective of colour or creed. We would rather be unpopular in certain quarters than be hypocritical. It is only when such criminals know that they will not live to enjoy their ill-gotten gains that they will stop. The death penalty is an eminently justpunishment for such criminals  for only death will stop those purveyors of misery and death.For us  the battle has barely begun. The international community must declare an all-out war against drug abuses and trafficking in deadly substances. The International Conference on drugs should come out not only with a definite plan of action but also with a firm political commitment by all participating nations  at the highest political level  to do their utmost. No stone should be left unturned and no avenues left unexplored in our war against this menace. We would like to see such political commitment expressed in a joint statement or declaration. That would be above and in addition to the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Actions  we view such an expression of political willingness as essential for a successful implementation of the actions we have mapped out.Once there is political commitment  then the source of drugs must be attacked with every available weapon  wherever that source may be. A full-scale war must be waged  and that war must be internationalized. The fight to destroy production is too big and too costly for any of the producer countries to wage alone.I am pleased by the interest shown by you  Mr. President  and the support given by the Assembly on the issue of Antarctica. That positive commitment by the United Nations strengthens the will of Malaysia and other like-minded countries to continue to pursue the objective of an Antarctica that is for all mankind and not for an exclusive few.The importance of Antarctica to mankind is beyond dispute. It is for that reason that we can never yield to the pressure mounted by certain quarters to bring us to relent and renege on our commitment. Antarctica should be under an internationally accepted regime and managed for the benefit of all mankind. We remain committed to working towards those objectives with all interested parties  including the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty. Last year  there was no consensus  in spite of our efforts. The Consultative Parties chose to remain adamant and indifferent to the sincere wishes of the majority.What we sought was merely more information and an updated and expanded study of Antarctica  more information on the mineral-regime negotiations and a follow-up response from the Consultative Parties concerning the call by the General Assembly for the exclusion of South Africa from participation in the group of Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. Yet that reasonableness and moderation proved unacceptable.We do not seek confrontation. We do not desire to threaten the security and interests of the Consultative Parties  nor do we wish to destroy the framework that the Consultative Parties have built. What we want is an internationally accepted system of management over Antarctica that caters to the interest of mankind as a whole. What we are after is improvement over the present situation  which is deficient and inclined towards exclusivity and therefore not in harmony with international aspirations.We are very clear about our commitment and very conscious of it. we should not falter in seeking out the objectives with which we began in 1982. Non-co-operation and non-participation by the Consultative Parties will not deter us from pursuing those objectives. It is the prerogative of the Consultative Parties either to opt in or opt out  but  for us  the decision is made. We therefore call upon the Consultative Parties to work with us towards attaining those universal objectives.In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm Malaysia's support of and commitment to the United Nations. If the Organization is to continue to contribute to world peace and the progress of all nations  big and small  we must live up to our obligations and responsibilities to the United Nations. Just as the major Powers must not expect the United Nations merely to serve them  so must the developing countries be guided by the same principle. The Organization must be revitalized and allowed to serve all mankind. The major Powers have a particular responsibility for preserving the role of the United Nations  for they will always have the edge in making or breaking the United Nations. Even for them  what alternative is there? Perhaps only a return to unilateralism and an alliance system  with its attendant dangers."
"97",5050,"NER",41,1986,"On 24 October 1985  the community of nations celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations. In a world suffering from countless problems and frustrations  that event gave rise to comfort and hope because it served as an occasion for sil of our countries  through their representatives ci the highest levels  to reaffirm unequivocally their commitment to the principles and ideals of the United Nations Charter and to renew their commitment to usher in a new era in which today's serious and complex problems can be faced collectively in a new spirit and with a new awareness of our interdependence and ^m: shared responsibility.That furnished us  with a just assessment of the challenges we must face  challenges that  by their very nature  make isolated approaches inoperative and suicidal. In particular  I am thinking of the crucial questions of peace and development. Present and future generations will judge our actions on the basis of what we do today and will do tomorrow  and especially at this forty-first session of the General Assembly  to preserve peace in the world and to find answers to the pressing questions of hunger  poverty and underdevelopment.I wish to stress the importance of the task the Assembly has unanimously entrusted to you its President. His talents as a skillful and experienced diplomat  a representative of a country  Bangladesh  whose commitment to the ideals of our Organization is well known  will certainly contribute to the success of our work. I should like  therefore  to convey to him the pleasure felt by my country  which shares with him a community of Islamic culture and destiny  at his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. My delegation will fully support him in the accomplishment of his task.His predecessor. Ambassador Jaime de Pinies of Spain  was a deserving President of our Assembly. To him  we extend the compliments and highest esteem of the delegation of the Niger for the important contribution he made to the work of our Organization.Our preceding session laid the groundwork for a solid platform of collective action for the common good  thereby arousing hopes with regard to man's determination to face adversity  to master and control his own baser nature and to work resolutely towards the building of the safer and more united world for which we all long.The proclamation of 1986 as the International Year of Peace is a further mark of our Organization's determination to harmonize the efforts of the international community in establishing an atmosphere that can ensure the maintenance of universal peace. More than 40 years after the end of the last world conflict  that universal peace continues to exist  notwithstanding the breaches and threatened breaches that still occur in many places in the world.If we truly want to succeed in this work of peace for the benefit of the whole of the world community  we must ensure the strict implementation of the fundamental principles of our Organization. In this connection  refraining from the use or threat of the use of force  the peaceful settlement of disputes  respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  respect for the right of peoples to self-determination and independence  are moral and cultural values to which each of our nations is committed. At the same time  they are imperative norms of international law to which our Governments have fully subscribed. As the lasting expression of the deep and legitimate aspirations of mankind  such values and norms embody our common fate. More than a code of conduct  they are a solid foundation upon which relations between peoples and nations must be based.It would appear that all the conflicts and dangerous situations in the world today arise from deliberate violations of those principles  but also from the serious and dangerous decline in the duty to co-operate and work together for the establishment of a new international economic order that would guarantee every people more harmonious and lasting development  as set forth in the United Nations Charter.We must therefore work together to adopt the measures needed to deal with the many situations the persistence of which seriously threatens international peace and security and reflects badly upon the credibility of our Organization.The policy of apartheid of the minority regime in Pretoria  its illegal occupation of Namibia and its repeated acts of aggression against the front-line States have created an explosive environment in the southern part of the African continent thus endangering peace and security not only in the region but in the world as well.In occupied Namibia  we see a continuation of delaying tactics intended to thwart the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of that Territory. This allows for the continuation  among other things  of the systematic plundering of that country's vast natural resources  which are then sold cheaply on the world market by the South African regime.In regard to its neighbors. South Africa is also pursuing  and has long done so  a policy of aggression  destabilization and intimidation. Never before have arrests  torture  mass murder and systematic violations of the law and morality that govern the external conduct of States been practiced with such cynicism and on such a vast scale as has been done by the South African regime.In the face of the infernal cycle of violence that today characterizes the situation in that part of the African continent and in the face of the serious dangers this poses to international peace and security  the time has come to gobeyond the usual jeremiads  verbal condemnations and resolutions that are not in fact resolutions.The minority racist regime of Pretoria has today finally provided the community of nations with proof of its blindness  its intransigence and its total disregard for law and universal morality.More effective means of pressure must necessarily be adopted urgently to support the struggle of the oppressed peoples of South Africa and Namibia  as well as the front-line States. Niger's position is perfectly clear on this matter. His Excellency General Seyni Kountche  President of the Supreme Military Council and Head of State of Niger  reaffirmed this at the last summit meeting of the Organization of African unity (OAU):""We must lend effective  appropriate and constant assistance to the liberation movements  as well as to the front-line States  in their struggle against oppression and aggression. Indeed  the time has come for the adoption of concrete and immediate measures to make the apartheid regime consider the situation and give way. These measures must undoubtedly include economic sanctions  which the international community and  particularly  the industrialized countries  must issue and apply in order finally to isolate those men who would deny man.""The immediate and effective application of the recommendations of the World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa held in Paris in June 1986 and of the International Conference for the Immediate Independence to Namibia held in Vienna the following month  as well as those of the eighth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries in Harare in September and the recent special session of the General Assembly on the question of Namibia  would no doubt compel the Pretoria regime to respect the decisions and resolutions of our Organization and finally to grant independence to Namibia and to promote within South Africa a democraticmultiracial society there the freedom  equality  dignity and well-being of all would be recognized and guaranteed.The great tragedy of our time that is taking plaoe in southern Africa has not however  made us forget other situations of conflict that still prevail on our con tin ait.As neighbors of Chad  a country with which we have ties of all sorts  we cannot remain indifferent to the situation of prolonged war and instability that has affected that country for several years now. As neighbors  we have come to know Chad  its people and its problems. The people of Chad has deep aspirations to peace. Like all other African peoples  it hopes to build a viable State and to set down the basis for its economic and social development. Rich in history  proud of its past  it is today fighting with the strength of despair against the demons of disunity and dislocation. These are legitimate aspirations. From its neighbors  with which it has cultivated friendship  from Africa  to which it firmly belongs  and from the international community  usually so ready to help  Chad expects understanding  support and assistance. It expects to be understood in its fierce will to remain itself and to be supported and assisted in its fervent hope to live in peace and to advance its development.Peace and development are also relevant matters in North-West Africa and  more generally  in the Maghreb  that rich and promising part of our continent  the natural evolution  course towards unity and progress of which have been slowed down  impeded and even handicapped by the conflict arising from the decolonization of the former Spanish Sahara.Closely tied to the peoples of the Maghreb by history  geography and culture  Niger cherishes the profound hope that the joint efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and of the current President of the Organization of African unity to organize a referendum on the question of self-determination will succeed in the near future.Africa  already facing the challenge of racism and besieged by so many problems inherent in its level of development  can only hope for the establishment of a climate of peace in its midst and of an atmosphere of confidence  tolerance and good neighborliness among all - a condition without which it cannot victoriously confront the pressing needs of building a better future.Other hotbeds of tension are giving rise to anguish and distress elsewhere and are also rightly of concern to the Assembly. The Middle East  that region near the African continent whose stability undeniably has a strong effect on world peace  has for several decades been the theater of ceaseless confrontation arising from a situation of injustice that has been created and maintained and for which the United Nations has a responsibility to which it remains fully committed.In this region of the world  so already battered by several conflicts  Israel has established a permanent climate of instability by developing a sustained policy of expansion  the major objective of which is to prevent the realization of the fundamental and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and to finalize the illegal annexation of the Golan and the occupation of Al Quds Al Sharif.Loyal to its consistent policy in that regard  Niger for its part will continue to support the just cause of the Palestinian people and to militate for the total withdrawal of Israel from all of the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories  including Jerusalem. In that connection  Niger is pleased to see that chances for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East are beginning to appear and are increasing.The continuation of the fratricidal conflict that has set Iran and Iraq against each other for six years now is a source of serious concern. The United Nations  through its Secretary-General  has repeatedly taken action to end that devastating and deadly conflict. Those efforts deserve to be continued and supported by us all.The brutal intrusion of foreign forces into Democratic Kampuchea and Afghanistan and the continued occupation of the territories of those two non-aligned countries have consistently been found reprehensible and condemned by the General Assembly as serious challenges to the principles governing friendly relations between States.We continue to support that point of view  to call for the total evacuation of occupation troops from the territories of those two countries and to call for scrupulous respect for their sovereignty  territorial integrity and status as non-aligned states.We similarly remain vigilant with regard to the tension in the Korean peninsula. We encourage continued efforts to bring about the reunification of this prestigious nation through peaceful means.Whether it be in Africa  Asia or Latin America - that other region of the world subject to serious upheavals - the true peace that we seek cannot be fully attained as long as division and discord exist among nations and as long as the profound aspirations of peoples to justice and to social progress continue to be disregarded and flouted.In addition to these numerous conflicts which bring suffering and grief all over the world  there are other challenges to the future of mankind. If we do not decisively meet those challenges there can be no genuine lasting peace on earth.Among those challenges is the serious  deep-seated and long-standing crisis in the world economy. Its root causes lie in the persistence of an unjust and inequitable international economic system marked by a continuous fall in commodity prices  by protectionism and restrictive trading practices  by monetary and financial instability and by the growing indebtedness of third-world countries.The situation is particularly critical for the African countries whose economies  already structurally fragile and vulnerable  have been further shaken and dislocated. In recent years some of these countries have experienced considerable slowing of their already low growth rates. The critical economic situation in Africa reflects both the scope and the effects of the crisis: the inability of the continent which was the cradle of mankind to achieve self-sufficiency in feeding its peoples  a situation inherent in the difficulty of rebuilding our agriculture; to build the infrastructure needed to irrigate our dry regions; to make our regions more accessible in order to permit a better flow of products; and to establish a true African policy of complementarity and co-operation among States in such areas as the fight against desertification and the important field of water management. To all those difficulties we add others no less burdensome  concerning the education  health and housing of our peoples  whom we wish to enable to lead healthy lives in order to participate more actively and with greater honour in the development of our continent and of the world.Africa is in the pitiless clutches of a drought  which has greatly reduced available water and arable land  destroying plant and animal life in vast areas  and killing thousands of men  women and children by hunger and thirst.In connection with agriculture  the roost recent report on Africa of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) states that pet capita production has fallen nearly 20 per cent since 1960  while the rate of growth of the population has increased by 3 per cent per year. That report states also that if things remain as they are  per capita production will fall another 30 per cent in the coming 25 years. The report further predicts that eventually the African States will  with few exceptions  will be forever condemned to dependency in satisfying their food requirements.That situation is of grave concern to African Governments  which have attempted to deal with the situation at the national  sub-regional and continental levels. At the national level  African leaders are redefining agricultural strategies and are working to maintain  diversity and rebuild vegetation  to protect the soil  to develop water resources  and to provide security in crop by promoting and developing crop production and animal husbandry.Considerable efforts to co-ordinate these national initiatives are being undertaken at the sub-regional and continental levels. In the Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel  nine countries have formulated a concerted rehabilitation program which gives priority to water management  to the campaign against desertification by means of reforestation  to the development of agriculture and livestock raising  and to building up of buffer stocks of grain.At the continental level  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has devoted much consideration to ways and means of dealing.with the situation. This has led to the establishment of the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for the Struggle against Drought and Famine in Africa  which is in operation now  and to the adoption of the Priority program for Economic Recovery in Africa.Clearly  Africa should not rely solely on outside assistance  but must make use of its own resources and intelligence  which will be its weapons in a victorious war to secure freedom from hunger. Only a pragmatic strategy based on basic requirements and the political will to undertake the needed reorientation of social and economic systems through revised agrarian methods and policies can lead to a solution to the problem of food.But Africa  which contains the majority of the world's poorest countries  cannot by itself meet this enormous  serious challenge posed by Nature. In that connection  Niger welcomes the great step forward taken at the special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa. It was possible at that special session to formulate and adopt a program of Action giving high priority to agriculture and related sectors. Its implementation will promote the rapid recovery of the African economy. Africa has conveyed its great appreciation for that initiative and for the solidarity of the international community in committing itself to stand by Africa and support it in its search for development by Africans and for Africans.As an expression of our joint political will  the United Nations program of Action for the Economic Recovery of Africa  1986-1990  is a contract of solidarity. Meeting the terms of that contract requires the same political will  fostered by a clear awareness that the future of Africa is indissolubly linked with the progress of the world.I wish now to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his effective and diligent work towards the success of that special session and towards its positive result. His interest in Africa and its problems and the attention he has devoted to them are nothing new  We of the Sahel know of his commitment  because on his own initiative heundertook a campaign to mobilize the assistance of the international community during the terrible drought of 1984. We are grateful to him for having always worked in favor of a just and peaceful world  and for his vision of a future based on mutual assistance and interdependence.We must pursue this action for Africa and broaden it to encompass other priority areas. I think here especially of the worrying problem of indebtedness. Niger joins the many other anguished voices calling for a joint solution to this problem  the ruinous effects of which are jeopardizing economic and social achievement in many countries.Through his intelligence and thanks to extraordinary scientific and technological progress  mankind has moved somewhat further into areas of the universe. But we must recognize today that there is one technology the development of which can only lead to the downfall of mankind: the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction  which become more sophisticated every year.We cannot but be shocked that the two super-Powers alone possess a nuclear arsenal sufficient to destroy our world several times over. Even more inadmissible is the fact that every year colossal sums are devoted to the development of nuclear weapons. Once that sum was $800 billion; today more than $1 trillion is devoted to the production of these deadly machines  at a time when so many people languish in horrific poverty and destitution.It cannot be over-emphasized that the arms race can never serve the interests of stability  peace and security. On the contrary  it is a source of tension between the super-Powers and even of confrontation which would be fatal for mankind.The nuclear-weapon Powers  especially the two super-Powers  therefore bear an important responsibility in this regard  and must do everything possible to avert the risk of nuclear confrontation. The only way to do this is to engage in sinceredialog with a view to formulating urgent disarmament measures leading to a gradual reduction in nuclear weapons until their complete elimination.In this connection  the Government and the people of Niger welcome the initiation in March 1985 of negotiations between the two super-Powers on intermediate-range and strategic nuclear and space weapons. A seal of approval was affixed to that dialog at the meeting between the leaders of the two countries  held at Geneva in November 1985. We hope that dialog will continue shortly at Reykjavik  and that it will lead to effective agreements aimed at general and complete disarmament.Those  in our view  are the major challenges of our time  daunting challenges in view of their nature and scope  but their solutions are vital for the future of mankind  and for international peace and security. The United Nations must deal with those challenges if it is not to founder and bring the whole world down with it. This is a categorical imperative.Millions of people throughout the world are increasingly expressing their firm opposition to the arms race and their unfailing abhorrence of: apartheid and racial discrimination. Millions of voices are continuously heard denouncing the continuation of sources of tension aid calling for a more stable and fraternal worId.In view of all those situations  and in view of the tidal wave of the brutal  savage and vile force of terrorism  the noble attitude of millions of men and women who voice every day their love of peace  justice and freedom  constitutes for our Governments and for our Organization  a source of inspiration and an encouraging reassurance of the value of our work here.We are convinced that we must not resign ourselves to the -many serious difficulties that are endangering universal peace. This is our world and we  together  bear the responsibility to preserve and improve it  for present and future generations."
"98",5095,"NGA",41,1986,"On behalf of the Nigerian delegation  I take this opportunity. Sir  to extend to you my congratulations on your unanimous and well-deserved election as President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. My delegation shares fully the warm sentiments expressed by previous speakers on your personal outstanding merits. I am confident that under your wise guidance this session will achieve significant success.It is therefore with great pleasure that I pledge the full support and co-operation of my delegation to you in the discharge of your difficult task  particularly at this tine  when  more than ever. Member States need to act in concert to attain an era of peace that will give a new direction to the course of human destiny. May I also extend my congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Jaise Pinies  your predecessor  for the able manner in which he handled the affairs of the fortieth session and thirteenth special session.I should also like to salute our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who  I am happy to see  has been restored to health. There can be no gainsaying that the best assurance of support we can give the Secretary-General is a revitalized United Nations.The relevance of the United Nations to the solution of urgent global problems is certainly not in contention. The devotion of the Organization to the maintenance of international peace and security has been balanced by an appreciation of the need to promote the economic and social well-being of mankind.In its 41-year history  the United Nations has gone beyond pious statements delivered with great solemnity in this Hall to the endorsement and implementation of action-oriented measures. Its achievements are legion. From successful peace-keeping operations in conflict areas around the world to the decolonization of Africa and Asia and the various activities and projects of its specialized agencies  the United Nations has become an effective instrument of international co-operation and development.Yet this cherished Organization is currently undergoing the gravest crisis in its history. Some call it a crisis of multilateralism. Others define it as a financial crisis. Fundamentally  it is a political crisis inflicted on the United Nations by its membership. Disagreements about the management and control of the Organization's budget and the determination of its programs are mere symptoms of a deeper difference in perceptions of the role and capability of the United Nations.Paradoxically  the present crisis is a welcome development to the extent that it provides us an opportunity to re-evaluate the activities and procedures of the United Nations. It is true that the gradual but significant expansion in the scope  range and volume of the work of the United Nations has been a function of changing international circumstances and new challenges that have confronted the Organization. Nevertheless  there can be no denying the fact that the United Nations could be more cost effective and efficient.-The necessary processes of reform and change have already begun. The Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts set up to review the efficiency of the financial and administrative functioning of the United Nations has already submitted its report. Since that report will be presented to the Assembly later on  under the appropriate agenda item  I shall refrain from commenting on it now. Suffice it to say that the Nigerian delegation attaches the greatest importance to the recommendations contained in that report. We believe that they provide a basis for revitalizing the IT of Nations and creating an organization better able to respond creditably and effectively to the collective needs of Member States  at reasonable and affordable cost.In any process of reform  difficult choices have to be made. New priorities will have to be set. Cost-saving measures must be instituted. Indeed  readjustments in assessed contributions may even become necessary. However  such measures should not be dictated or imposed by any Member State or group of States. Instead  they should derive from negotiated agreement among all Member States. To do this successfully  we will all have to be tolerant and to appreciate each other's legitimate interests and concerns. Let us move away from apportioning blame and accept that the United Nations can only function on the basis of a consensus that adequately respects the concerns of each and all.Thus  as a sign of good faith  those countries that have resorted to financial withholding as a means of registering their disapproval of the United Nations budget and programs should proceed to honor their obligations. The point has been made that the Organization is in need of reform  and the first steps towards that process of reform have already been taken. Those reforms should not be taken under duress.Surely  a United Nations that grinds to a halt as the result of financial constraints cannot even engage in reform. One thing we all agree upon is that the United Nations is worth preserving. If it were not  we would not all be present here. A testament to the continued validity of the United Nations lies in the fact that the very countries that have been most vocal in calling attention to its shortcomings continue to exploit the forum it offers to address the world community on major issues of concern to them. Clearly  it is better to talk at the United Nations than to fight on the battlefield.In addition  it is the view of the Nigerian delegation that the necessary reforms should be carried out in full accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The principle of sovereign equality of all Member States should not be derogated directly or indirectly  and essential programs and activities of high priority should continue to attract the lion's share of available resources. In other words  we must ensure that we do not end up cutting the bone while we trim the fat.The present international situation is characterized by growing tension in both the political and the economic spheres. Confrontation  conflict and instability plague many regions of the world  and the economies of many Member States continue to deteriorate  while the politics of domination and great-Power rivalries are on the increase. In that situation  the role of the Organization has more than ever before  become vital for the promotion of international peace  development and prosperity for all.All too often  we tend to forget that the Charter of the United Nations devotes two Chapters to the question of international economic and social co-operation. Indeed  in Article 55  the United Nations pledges itself to the promotion of ""higher standards of living  full employment"" and ""solutions of international economic  social  health  and related problems""  ""with a view to the creation of the conditions of stability and well-being necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations"". Therefore  if the inequities in the world economic system have persisted for so long  the fault is not with the Charter. Rather  it derives from the lack of political will by Member States to discharge their obligations.Within the framework of the current global economic crisis  the widening gap between developed and developing countries and the persistence of an unjust and inequitable international economic system constitute major impediments to the development process of most Member States  thus posing a serious threat to international peace and security.For their part  the industrialized countries have refused to address the problems of structural imbalance and inequality that characterize the international economic and trading system. Those imbalances have continued to prolong the severe set-backs afflicting our economic goals and objectives.It is clear that we must once again consider seriously the problem of structural imbalance and inequality with a view to formulating concrete andeffective solutions to the question of the huge external debt of developing countries  the problems of debt-servicing  high interest rates  inflation  declining commodity prices  stiff conditions set by the International Monetary Fund  and protectionist measures and unfair trade terms continually imposed by the developed countries.Commodity trade is currently the primary source of foreign-exchange earnings for a majority of developing countries. It is regrettable that specific measures to control commodity trade to the advantage of the developed market-economy countries should be embarked upon without sympathy or consideration for the repercussions on the current balance-of-payments position of developing countries.Commodity prices are currently fluctuating and are therefore unstable. There is a continuous decline in capital resource flows as the result of lower export earnings  and this is a great hindrance to reinvestment in commodities. Financing through the facilities of the Common Fund for commodities has not materialized owing to the refusal by some major countries to ratify the instrument. This state of affairs has created complex cash-flow problems  which have further aggravated the debt problem. The high hopes of the developing countries for a new international economic order have foundered owing to a deeply rooted reluctance on the part of the developed countries to engage in an honest and Meaningful North-South dialog. My delegation wishes to stress the need for a fundamental structural readjustment in the international economic system that would promote rapid and sustained world economic growth and development. In this context  we reaffirm our commitment to the continued validity and relevance of the Declaration and program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.while developed countries have emerged from recession  the economic outlook for the developing nations in general  and Africa in particular  remains bleak. Attempts were made to draw the world's attention to Africa's special situation during last May's special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa. That special session succeeded at least in deepening global awareness of the dimensions of the current economic crisis in Africa. Given good intentions and strong will  that endeavor could well provide a basis for concerted efforts by the international community to enhance and support the tremendous efforts of African States to surmount their devastating crisis.My delegation therefore appeals to the international community and to financial institutions to make available without delay sufficient resources for the full and effective implementation of the United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  1986-1990. We do not  of course  ignore or lose sight of the need for developing countries themselves to co-operate effectively in improving their economic conditions. To that end a greater degree of collaboration on economic projects has to be developed. We are happy to note the activities of the Group of 77  in particular at the last meeting of the Group's Intergovernmental Follow-up and Co-ordination Committee (IFCC)  which took place at Cairo and which focused attention on vital areas of high priority in co-operation among developing countries that needed greater emphasis. Similarly  we are gratified that the eighth summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement  which took place earlier this month at Harare  devoted considerable attention to economic co-operation.An important and appropriate backdrop to our debate at this session is the declaration of 1986 as the International Year of Peace. As demanded in the solemn declaration. Member States of the United Nations have been focusing attention throughout the year on the requirements for the promotion of international peace and security. We in Nigeria have organized  at both the governmental and the non-governmental levels  various programs aimed at sensitizing the Nigerian people to the elements of genuine peace and to the role of the individual  of the State  of non-governmental organizations and of the United Nations in the promotion of peace. On 16 September  International Peace Day  Nigeria joined several other countries  when President Ibrahim Babangida personally launched the first Earth Run  the global torch relay which originated on the steps of the Headquarters of our Organization.Unfortunately  peace remains elusive in many parts of the world. The situation in southern Africa  for instance  continues to be a source of concern to this Organization. In the past two years the world has witnessed the most aggressive phase of Pretoria's policies of mindless oppression and intimidation of the blacks  who have been subjected to the persistent and systematic violation of their fundamental human rights. Apartheid has meant violence and terror for the struggling people of South Africa. The apartheid regime is still undeterred in its implementation of policies which are repressive and are offensive to the laws of natural justice. Indeed  apartheid is a crime against humanity and against the ignity and conscience of mankind  and it continues to pose a threat to international peace and security. There can be no peace and stability in southern Africa without the elimination of apartheid  which is the root cause of the grave crisis in the entire region.Since  in the wake of the Sharpeville massacres  the world was rudely awakened to the brutality and horrors of apartheid  there has been unanimous and repeated condemnation of that evil system. The crushing weight of apartheid has grown to the point where it has forced all segments of the oppressed to rebel in a spontaneous manner. The Soweto uprising demonstrated the fact that despite all the brutal machinery sustaining apartheid the black people of South Africa have had enough and cannot suffer in silence any more. Thousands of blacks  including mourners  have been gunned down by trigger-happy racist police; many more have been wounded or have suffered untold hardship. The response of the racist clique in Pretoria has been to resort to panic measures and to the declaration of a state of emergency  with a total clamp-down on news reports.This notwithstanding  workers have initiated strike actions  and an ever-growing number of school children  working independently  have periodically boycotted classes to show their revulsion at the political powerlessness  economic deprivation  inferior education and dehumanizing segregation laws imposed on them by the racist regime. The countdown to the collapse of apartheid has at last started. As the cycle of violence and brutal repression grows in scale and intensity  the blacks have now resolved to make the supreme sacrifice.The racist regime  instead of moving towards open negotiations with black leaders and reconciling anxious whites to inescapable change  persists in pretending that South Africa's problems at home and its already painful economic losses abroad can be chased away with a night-stick. Clearly  the apartheid regimehas shown that it is no mood to seek in peace the establishment of a democratic society in South Africa built on the equality of all races.The fight against apartheid and racism is one facet of the liberation struggle in Africa. Another facet is the struggle for the liberation of Namibia  where the situation is equally explosive. The racist Pretoria rSgime persists in its illegal occupation of the Territory by ruthlessly suppressing the legitimate aspiration of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence. In spite of United Nations resolutions  culminating in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which established modalities by which the people of Namibia would determine their future through free and fair elections  the racist regime has continued its policies of dehumanizing and brutalizing the overwhelming majority of Namibians.Contacts between the Secretary-General and the apartheid regime aimed at finding an honorable way for the withdrawal of the South African administration have been frustrated through devious machinations by the racist regime. In fact  the posture of the regime constitutes a total rebuff of any meaningful discussion. The sad position now is that the illegal regime has gone ahead with the implementation of its so-called homelands policy aimed at destroying the unity and territorial integrity of Namibia.My delegation recognizes that peace cannot be achieved in southern Africa in an environment characterized by criminal acts of aggression  racial discrimination and the systematic violation of human rights. The apartheid regime in South Africa is still undeterred in its implementation of policies that are repressive and offensive to human dignity. The international community  if it is not to be accused of complicity or impotence  must assume a more decisive role in the liquidation of the abhorrent and totally despicable system of apartheid. We must without fail put an end to it. Indeed  if a bloodbath of unspeakable proportions is to be avoided the international community will have to exert such pressure as will make the apartheid regime abandon its criminal policy. Surely  comprehensive mandatory sanctions applied faithfully by all Member States offer the last hope for a peaceful solution.Happily  there is now much international enthusiasm for the campaign against apartheid. A vast majority of States  such as the members of the Non-Aligned Movement  the socialist States  the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  the Nordic States and a few Western countries  have taken steps to combat apartheid. The United States Congress too has joined in this great movement to guarantee to the South African black people  23 million of them  the right to life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness.Apartheid is not an internal affair of South Africa  but a universal affair. Witness the amount of time  energy and resources the international community devotes to it. Legitimately  therefore  this Assembly can and should miss no opportunity to advance the universal effort to achieve the peaceful dismantling of apartheid.In that context  I propose that you  Mr. President  address on our behalf an urgent appeal  today  to the President of the United States to endorse the congressional action on sanctions against South Africa.As for Nigeria  our commitment to the anti-apartheid struggle is total. We shall continue to give support to the liberation movements and assistance to the front-line States.The question has often been raised in recent times whether we  either as Africans or as members of the international community  shall be prepared to offer the white community in South Africa an opportunity to be part of the process of change in South Africa. The answer is that we have always been prepared to accept the white community and its representatives as constituents in the process of change  provided change is the objective.The Lusaka Declaration  first adopted by the Organization of African Unity and then by the United Nations  still represents our position. If the South African Government is prepared to talk about an effective program for the dismantlement of apartheid  we shall be prepared to facilitate the implementation of such a program.The challenge  then  to South Africa and the opponents of mandatory economic sanctions is to get the South African regime to present a concise  detailed and specific program for the total eradication of apartheid.The efforts of the international community for a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict have been frustrated by repeated acts of aggression and terrorism in that region. The solution to the Middle East question does not lie in the force of arms  which  rather than ameliorating the explosive situation  has further complicated the task of achieving peace. A comprehensive and just solution to the problems of the Middle East cannot be achieved unless there is a cessation of hostilities by all the parties concerned. Similarly  the present volatile situation cannot subside in the wake of territorial ambitions.An issue that is central to the Middle East debacle is the problem of a homeland for the Palestinians. A realistic analysis of the reasons for the failures of past peace efforts reveal the non-acceptance of the Palestinian question as the principal problem for which there should be a genuine solution. No solution to the Middle East problem which does not take into account the plight of the Palestinians can be expected to guarantee durable peace in that region. The countries in the Middle East and the international community as a whole have to be sympathetic to the Palestinian cause  particularly the Palestinians' quest for a homeland. However  that is not to deny the right of Israel to existence as a State.My delegation supports the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle East where all those involved would participate. There can be no justification for holding a conference with the primary responsibility of solving the problems of people who are not allowed to participate in it. The Palestinians should be involved in the peace process in the Middle East.The resumption of bilateral arms negotiations by the two super-Powers early in 1985 gave the world some hope of improved political relations between the East and the West. That hope was further increased when on 1 January 1986 the leaders of the two world Powers exchanged new year messages. It is sad that what seemed to bean improved political understanding between the East and the West has not been translated into action in the ongoing disarmament negotiations  while the world community was expecting genuine disarmament efforts  there was a resumption of nuclear tests  and this had negative implications for the moratorium on nuclear-weapon testing.Nuclear weapons constitute a threat not only to peace and international security  but also to the survival of mankind. The elimination of nuclear weapons should be a vital disarmament objective of the world community  irrespective of ideological beliefs. The two super-Powers should give the lead in nuclear disarmament. A most desirable starting-point would be an agreement on a nuclear test ban  a measure which the international community has advocated for the past 25 years. We believe that no technical reason  such as the issue of verification  offers a genuine excuse for the delay in concluding a nuclear-test-ban treaty. What is lacking is the will on the part of nuclear-weapon States. In addition to the basic step of a nuclear test ban  we call for the commencement of real and decisive measures through bilateral and multilateral negotiations that will substantially reduce and ultimately eliminate the existing stockpile of nuclear weapons. Needless to say  the extension of the nuclear arms race to outer space is inconsistent with the fervent wish of the international community for nuclear disarmament. Disarmament is a global cause  in which all States have a vital stake. It cannot  and should not  be left to the vagaries of the relationship between the super-Powers.Our Organization has an important role to play in keeping up the pressure to bring about a halt to the arms race  with the ultimate aim of achieving general and complete disarmament  under effective international control. In this regard my Government urges both the Soviet Union and the United States not to interrupt theprocess of consultation and negotiation with the ultimate objective of eliminating nuclear weapons from the face of the earth.There are other problems facing the international community that require our urgent attention. The Iran-Iraq war  the crisis in Central America and the issues of Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Cyprus and Korea all challenge our collective commitment to work for the promotion of the peaceful settlement of issues. I have highlighted only some of the major problems confronting us I believe we shall work together to solve these as well as the other problems.The United Nations serves as a unique forum for the promotion of understanding and peace among all nations. It also provides a unique opportunity for Member States to engage in constructive dialog and co-operation in our common quest for a better world. We must  therefore  strive to work together to uphold the principles of the Charter in the interests of mankind."
"99",5140,"NIC",41,1986,"First of all. Sir  I would like to express my delegation's satisfaction at seeing you preside over this General Assembly. Bangladesh is a non-aligned country with a great tradition of struggle for the cause of peace and justice. This fart  together with your excellent qualities as a diplomat  assures us that the important matters to be debated in the course of the present session of the General Assembly will receive evenhanded treatment.I should also like to express to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our satisfaction over seeing him fully recovered  and we send him words of encouragement in the difficult task posed by the critical moments through which our Organization is living.I must also state here our appreciation to Mr. Jaime de Pinies of Spain for the efficient and fair manner in which he presided over the previous session of the General Assembly.Despite the great efforts which both Nicaragua and the countries of the Contadora and Lima Groups have been carrying out  despite the solemn statements issued by the Movement of Non-Aligned Nations and many other countries of the world  condemning the interventionist policy and illegal use of force by the United States government against Nicaragua  and despite the finding of the International Court of Justice of 27 June 1986  condemning and ordering the immediate end to this illegal policy  the spiral of war continues.This undeniable reality led the Contadora and Lima Groups to state  only nine days ago  that ""the crisis in Central America is becoming more serious every day  and the risk of war is increasing.3 (A/41/662  p. 2)Four days after that statement was issued  a young member of the army that defends Nicaragua's national sovereignty shot down an American airplane  with a crew of Americans  carrying a large quantity of weapons and different kinds of explosives  a kind of advance on the infamous -$100 million"" that the Reagan Administration  with the complicity of the United States Congress  has approved to continue the systematic slaughter of our people in the dirty mercenary war that has turned Central America into a laboratory for testing new forms of war with which the United States is combating the struggles for independence  self-determination and genuine democracy of the peoples of Latin America and the world.How many times did representatives hear an ambassadress of the united states accuse us here of being ""paranoid"" because we denounced aggression against our people as United States aggression? We all know that deceit and lies  together with the use and the threat of the use of force  are essential tools of the Reagan Administration's foreign policy. Let no one be offended by this statement; it is not our intention to offend anyone. We simply state the truth without ambiguity  because peace  which is the fundamental objective of Nicaragua's policies and a universal aspiration  obliges us to speak clearly. Events have shown that we are not ""paranoid"". The Reagan Administration  in addition to violating the principles of the United Nations Charter  also lies. It is just as the International Court of Justice said:""The United States of America  by training  arming  equipping  financing and supplying the contra forces or otherwise encouraging  supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua  has acted  against the Republic of Nicaragua  in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.The Reagan Administration's contribution to imperialism's longstanding ambitions has been its rediscovery of the use of citizens of other countries to fight imperialism's wars. In this way it tries to avoid paying the political priceattached to sacrificing American lives  taking advantage of the fact that they have been able to deform the conscience of a considerable number of Americans who view genocide against other peoples  especially if they are from the third world  with alarming indifference.Thus  in this war which the United States Administration is waging against the people of Nicaragua in order to make them  in President Reagan's words  ""Cry Uncle""  there have already been more than 3U U00 victims. Nevertheless  in spite of the mercenary nature of this war  at least five Americans have already been killed due to the criminal policy of the Reagan Administration  not counting those who died in the recent accident involving a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) aircraft in Texas  or others who have died in Honduras  Costa Rica and El Salvador.As a result of the recent downing of an American aircraft in Nicaragua on 5 October  we now have the first prisoner clearly identified as a United States military adviser in El Salvador. I personally had in my hands the identity card issued to him by the Salvadorian air force  complete with photograph  accrediting him as a United States military adviser. Naturally  this American prisoner will be brought before the courts and tried in accordance with Nicaraguan laws  with all guarantees of due process.In declarations to the national and international press yesterday in Managua the United States prisoner  Eugene Hasenfus  stated that he worked for the CIA and that two CIA agents  naturalized Americans of Cuban origin. Max Gomez and Ramon Medina  his direct superiors  were co-ordinating most of the flights from El Salvador carrying weapons  ammunitions and supplies for the counter-revolutionary mercenaries. He also explained how the territories of Costa Rica  El Salvador and Honduras are used in those CIA operations  all with the full knowledge and authorization - in the words of the United States prisoner - of the authorities of those countries.Despite all the subterfuges and lies employed by the Reagan Administration to cover up its criminal policy towards Nicaragua; despite its cover-up of the fact that  although war has not been declared officially  the United States Government is waging a war of aggression against Nicaragua  in which the shortcomings of Reagan's mercenaries have forced it to get more and more involved itself? despite its having pressured several Central American countries in every way that could be dreamed up by those that have made the systematic use of blackmail an essential part of their foreign policy - despite all that  the world sees clearly that this war of aggression is a dirty  illegal and immoral war. It sees it as a war which the United States is waging against Nicaragua with the sole objective of getting our country to submit to the concept of limited sovereignty  an inevitable corollary to its being regarded as the United States back yard  something which others might accept but Nicaragua never will. We are not enemies  nor do we wish to be enemies  of the United States; but nor are we  nor do we wish to be its back yard. We are defending our total independence  because only thus can we establish the relations of respect that make friendship possible. I refer once more to the Contadora Declaration of 1 October  which contained the following passages:""Those who believe in a military solution are disregarding the true dimension of the problem. We wish to draw attention to what is at stake: expansion of the conflict  intensification of the confrontations  and war ...""Latin America ... does not wish the principles of self-determination and non-intervention to be sacrificed in the name of security or democracy ...""... the prevention of war in Central America is a task for all politically responsible Governments and individuals who are prepared to defend the cause of peace."" The decision of the United States Government to send American military advisers to train the contra mercenaries is clear proof that theReagan Administration remains determined to cause more death and destruction. That decision and the decision to turn the direction of the war over to the CIA and to give $100 million people to the mercenaries serve only to perpetuate the ""agony of endless battle""  as pointed out in an editorial in The New York Times yesterday.Many Americans - I would say most - are aware of that  as is shown by all the public opinion polls on the subject. Four United States veterans and war heroes have chosen to emphasize that truth by issuing a Christian call for peace. Although they have now gone without food for 40 days  their voices have fallen on the deaf ears of those that have ordered the murder of an entire people  daring to claim they are doing so in defense of the Holy Gospel.I say to President Reagan and Secretary of State Shultz  wherever they are  from here at the United Nations  we demand in the name of God  in whom they say they believe and in whom my people and I do indeed trust  that they stop the war that they abide by the ruling of the International Court of Justice  that they bring their foreign policy into line with the norms contained in the Charter  because  although they are powerful  they should not think that they have been endowed with rights which God has not given any man or any nation. We hold them responsible and one day they will have to account for their actions before the Lord  for all the blood that has been shed and all the suffering inflicted on so many innocents as a result of their insatiable lust for domination. We hold them responsible  in advance  for whatever may befall the fasters for peace  whom they have unwisely ignored so far. There can be no doubt that the United States is very rich and powerful and feels it can mock all the courts in the world  but it is time for it to start fearing the implacable justice of the God of peace and life  for  believe me  this justice cannot be mocked or evaded.The States which make up the United Nations are well aware of the many initiatives taken by Nicaragua in search of a peaceful solution  in line with international law  to the dispute with the United States. There have been many appeals to the United States Government to abandon its illegal policy of intervention and force against Nicaragua and bring its conduct into line with the norms of law  as befits a world super-Power and a permanent member of the Security Council.Unfortunately  the number of negative responses has been equal to the number of appeals made. After the various efforts to bring about bilateral negotiation had failed Nicaragua decided to initiate legal proceedings against the United States at the International Court of Justice  the top judicial body of the United Nations  in the hope that resort to that forum would make it possible to attain the peace and respect to which the people of Nicaragua and the other Central American countries aspire.On 27 June this year the International Court of Justice  in a historic decision  which already forms part of the common heritage of all the peoples and nations of the planet  condemned the united States in no uncertain terms for its many and repeated violations of the most sacred principles and tenets of the international legal order  respect for which is the basis of world peace.The date 27 June 1986 is that of a milestone in the history of international law and the beginning of a new stage in the development of the united Nations system. For the first time in the history of our Organization the highest tribunal of justice condemned a great Power which  ironically  proclaims itself to he a great defender of the international legal order. It condemned the United States for its illegal policy of intervention and force against Nicaragua  a small  impoverished nation  which to defend its inalienable right to independence and self-determination has only the indestructible will of its people  the solidarity of the nations and peoples of the world and  most especially  international law  justice and morality.It nay be that the international community has not yet had sufficient time to appreciate the tremendous impact and significance that this decision of the International Court of Justice will have on the future of international relations and the United Nations. Our Organization is based on certain fundamental principles on respect for which the very existence of the United Nations depends -unless we wish for the Organization a fate similar to that of the ill-starred League of Nations. At present it is clear that international peace and security depend on full compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter: the sovereign equality of States  the political independence and self-determination of peoples  non-use of force in international relations  non-intervention in the internal and external affairs of other States  and the peaceful solution of international disputes.It would not be an exaggeration to state that the history of international relations and of the United Nations can now be divided into two general periods; before and after 27 June 1986. If the United States of America abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice  freedom would flourish in the world and all peoples would draw on the wealth of their own culture  so that humanity could advance towards unexpectedly lofty goals of political  economic and social development. Defiance of the ruling by the United States of America would mean that that super-Power had opted for war  aid that the dark shadow of violence would move across the earth. Our Organization and its embodiment of the dream of peace and freedom would be in a situation not unlike that which mankind experienced during the 1930s.Since the ruling of 27 June 1986  Nicaragua has seen the confirmation of what it has been saying all along. I should like to recall one of the statements included by Nicaragua in the 30 April 1985 brief it submitted to the International Court of Justice:""It is significant that it is only in the forum of the International Court of Justice that Nicaragua is able to confront the United States on an equal basis without the results of the dispute being affected by the overwhelming military and economic power of the adversary. Nicaragua asks the Court not only to uphold its legal rights  but also to defend the administration of international justice from being perverted in the hands of the powerful.""Nicaragua went in search of justice before that lofty forum  where all States are equal no natter what their level of development or strength. Justice was done  and  taking into account the great significance of the ruling it is fitting to recall some of the determinations of the Court. The Court clearly pointed out th.it adherence by a State to any particular doctrine did not constitute a violation of customary international law  and that to hold otherwise would make nonsense of the fundamental principle of State sovereignty on which the whole of international law rests.The Court ruled that the violations of international law committed by the United States through its aggressive actions against Nicaragua could not be justified either by the plea of collective self-defense  inasmuch as the condition sine qua non that would make it necessary had not been fulfilled  or by an alleged right of the United States to adopt counter measures involving the use of force in the face of a purported intervention by Nicaragua in El Salvador. It must be added that the United States was unable to prove its repeated charges of intervention  despite - as was recognized by the International Court of Justice -""the deployment by the United States in the region of extensive technical resources for tracking  monitoring and intercepting air  sea and land traffic"" and the active assistance of the Governments allegedly affected.Now another huge lie has been revealed  with the downing of the United States C-123 airplane registered in Miami under the number N-4410-F and in El Salvador  as of 23 August last  under the number HP-824  with the documents found on that airplane and with the ample statements made by the surviving American  who is being held pr is oner: El Salvador  far from being the victim the United States Government claims it to be  is one of the three main bases of the imperialist aggression against Nicaragua. The prisoner's statements and the documents found demonstrate once more the clear involvement of the Governments of El Salvador  Honduras and Costa Rica in the mercenary war by which the United States Government is trying to deny Nicaragua  and all of Central America  the exercise of the right of self-determination.The determination of the United States Government to continue its illegal policy of force against Nicaragua and the alarming military buildup in Honduras have forced Nicaragua to continue military preparations in defense of its independence  self-determination and territorial integrity. One of the most serious consequences of United States policy in Central America is the disproportionate and unjustified militarization of the sister republic of Honduras  which has turned that country into a gigantic United States military base.So-called assistance to Honduras has gone from 310 million in 1982 to almost $313 million in 19£C>. Since 1979  27 United States military bases and 11 landing-strips and air bases for military use have been constructed  along with dozens of other types of military installations. The Honduran armed forces have swelled from 23 000 to almost 50 000 soldiers. The Honduran air force has become by far the most powerful in the region  going from 137 war-planes and helicopters in 1982 to some 330 aircraft in 1986  among them modern F-5s  the mostsophisticated in the entire region  and C-130 transport planes  the largest in the area. Moreover  the United States has given Honduras more than 500 heavy artillery pieces; these have increased in number from 240 in 1982 to some 7S0 in 1986. We must add to all this armored vehicles  whose numbers stood at approximately 70 in 1982 and which now number more than 200 armored vehicles and tanks. As can he seen  the military buildup in Honduras  one of the poorest countries in Latin America  has been on the order of 300 per cent in only five years. The significance of the sum total of weapons and military assistance supplied and military infrastructure installed could not be fully understood if we failed to mention the existence of wide-ranging military agreements between the United States and Honduras  the signing of new defense treaties and  above all  the constant maneuvers  an excuse to keep thousands of United States troops in Honduras  and above all the fact that Honduras is not a country suffering any sort of aggression or armed conflict that could justify such a degree of militarization. Moreover  it can be asserted that  by virtue of its military agreements with the United states  Honduras could easily do without any of this bloated military apparatus  in the knowledge that its external security is fully guaranteed by the military might of the United States. But if defense is not the motive  we must ask ourselves what then are the aims of this overwhelming military build-up in impoverished Honduras.The entire military infrastructure that has been built  all the warplanes  tanks and radars that have been supplied are not there for the defense of Honduras' sovereignty  but serve as a menacing launching pad for aggression against Nicaragua and a destabilizing factor for the whole Central American region  as well as providing cover for the provision of military aid  training and instructions to the mercenary forces based in Honduras.The international community must be made aware of the extensive war preparations under way in Honduras  for it is there that for years the specter of war has been nurtured and intervention plotted against the peoples of Central America. If the United Nations and all peace-loving nations do not respond Quickly  the result will be a most dangerous and prolonged conflict that will involve Central America  Latin America and the whole world.The Nicaraguan Government believes that its first line of defense is the rule of international law and the constant encouragement of its methodical and appropriate application. For that reason  although it stands to arms to defend its sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  Nicaragua has turned to the International Court of Justice to appeal to the main author of the aggression of which it is a victim  as well as to its main accomplices and allies  to return to common sense and civilized conduct.Nicaragua will continue insisting on these civilized means for resolving international disputes. That is why we have sought  by means of suits filed against Honduras and Costa Rica in the International Court of Justice  to exercise our right to self-defense with our first and foremost means of defense -international law. Our two neighbors have confessed that they lend their territories to the mercenary bands which are financed  organized  directed and supplied by the United States  and whose main actions have been aimed at committing innumerable acts of terrorism against the civilian population of Nicaragua. By this sort of conduct the Governments of Honduras and Costa Rica have not only turned the territory of their respective countries into sanctuaries for bands of mercenaries and terrorists; they have also turned themselves into aggressors together with the main aggressor.The Central American tragedy is being repeated in other parts of the world: in southern Africa  the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Those conflicts which the third world is suffering the wounds must not  however  make us forget the responsibility which we all have with regard to the gravest threat facing humanity today - the danger of a nuclear war. The initiative undertaken by Argentina  India  Greece  Mexico  Sweden and Tanzania since May 1984  strengthened recently in the Ixtapa message  is a valuable effort to make the nuclear Powers hear our voice  and reflects the obligation that the nuclear Powers have to take the vital interests of all the peoples of the world into account in their negotiations. In order to restore and safeguard international peace and security it is essential to avoid extending the nuclear threat into space  to put an end to all atomic testing  and to open the door to negotiations for substantial reductions of nuclear arsenals  within the framework of general and complete disarmament. We earnestly hope that the universal clamor for the total abolition of nuclear arms will be heeded at the meeting that is to take place tomorrow between President Reagan and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Gorbachev  and that that meeting will lead to specific progress towards an easing of tension and disarmament.The very same forces that are work today trying to destroy the international legal order  that show contempt for the International Court of Justice  that block efforts at regional negotiation and raise the specter of war over our peoples are the forces that are attempting to undermine the foundations of our Organization by resorting to financial blackmail. The report presented by the Group of 18 intergovernmental experts contains recommendations that can be extremely useful for increasing savings and efficiency. However  this must not serve as a pretext for yielding to those interests which seek to change the democratic structure which gives the United Nations its strength  or impose decision-making mechanisms which involve a threat to paralyse the Organization.To the problems and concerns which we have just outlined we must add another element which is now engrossing the attention of the developing countries: the crisis in the international economy. The current trends in the world economy lead us to conclude that the historic underdevelopment which has been imposed upon us  far from being redressed  is in fact worsening. Foreign debt  commodity prices  the terms of trade  interest rates  protectionist trade barriers  negative capitalflows - terms once employed only by experts - have become part of the daily vocabulary of our peoples and their leaders. They know full well that the elimination of the negative trends in those factors mean greater opportunities in employment  education  social progress - in short  a more dignified life - whereas if  on the contrary  there is any further deterioration in them  it will entail unemployment  economic stagnation  poverty and  in many cases  death itself.Unfortunately  that is precisely the tendency that prevails  which reflects the magnitude of the injustice and inequality that rule current international economic relations.The foreign debt is the most pressing problem facing the developing countries today. The policies of adjustment that are being imposed on our peoples with the sole objective of ensuring payment of the interest on that debt are only wideninq the gap separating developed and underdeveloped countries. The debt is a problem of a political nature and it can only be solved if it is treated as such.The existence in southern Africa of the hated apartheid regime constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. The South African regime  in addition to segregating and slaughtering its peoples  practices State terrorism against the front-line States. It also occupies the vast and rich Territory of Namibia  subjecting its population to a system of exploitation identical to apartheid. There can be no doubt that comprehensive mandatory sanctions are the only peaceful and effective means left to the international community to put an end to that crime. The policy of constructive engagement must also be abandoned immediately.The international community must demand that the United States stop giving support to the UN IT A mercenaries in their campaign to destabilize the legitimate Government of the Republic of Angola.We reiterate our active solidarity with the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the sole  legitimate representative of the Namibian people.The Middle East continues to be one of the regions in which international peace and security are most seriously threatened. As long as the United Statescontinues its unconditional support for Israel the possibilities of the escalation and expansion of the conflict will increase. Nicaragua believes that no attempt to solve the Middle East problem without Guaranteeing the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people can succeed. Moreover  the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in any initiative in the region is essential if a just and stable peace is to be established.The sister country of Cyprus is the victim of foreign occupation that threatens its unity and its non-aligned status. We support the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions.Several months ago the Mediterranean was the scene of a reprehensible  unjustified attack by the United States against Libya. In the face of such terrorist acts the international community must step up its efforts to convert the Mediterranean into a region of peace  security and co-operation.Nicaragua expresses its support for the efforts being made by the countries of Indo-China to establish a dialog leading to a negotiated solution to the region's problems.Nicaragua is in favor of a prompt solution to the deplorable conflict between two sister countries  Iran and Iraq  members of our Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. In order to last  that solution must be just and in keeping with the principles of international law  non-alignment and the United Nations Charter. The suffering of the peoples of those two countries must come to an end.In Afghanistan  we support the efforts made by the Secretary-General to attain a political and negotiated solution that ensures the right of self-determination of the people of Afghanistan.Nicaragua strongly supports the peaceful reunification of Korea and the withdrawal of United States troops from the southern part of the peninsula.Nicaragua reiterates its solidarity with the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic and reaffirms that the situation in Western Sahara  being a colonial problem  can be resolved only in accordance with resolution 1514 (XV)  under which the brother Sahsran people are guaranteed their legitimate right to self-determination in the framework of resolution 104 of the Organization of African unity (OAU) and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.In Latin America and the Caribbean  despite the indomitable struggle of our peoples there still exist peoples which are denied  through the application of techniques of colonialism of varying degrees of sophistication  their legitimate right to independence. We reiterate our solidarity with the Puerto Rican people in their just struggle for self-determination and independence.We confirm our decisive  unwavering support for the sister republic of Argentina in its legitimate claim to the Malvinas Islands.In El Salvador  the just aspirations of the people have not been fulfilled. The imperialist policy prevents a negotiated solution to the present conflict as advocated by the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation-Revolutionary Democratic Front. That policy must be ended in order to guarantee the brother Salvadorian people its legitimate right to self-determination.Because revolutionary Nicaragua has always spoken clearly and unambiguously  because we defend and will always defend the ideals of our heroes  because we follow a policy based on principles rather than individual interests  because we are non-aligned  because we are anti-imperialist  anti-apartheid and anti-colonialist  because we have truth and justice on our side and because we defend peace  our people are suffering a cruel and prolonged war of aggression.Our principles irritate the powerful  so they impose war on us. Nevertheless we are willing to continue to struggle to find means of understanding that willpermit us to achieve peace - but a worthy peace  not the peace of subjugation or of the tomb.Meanwhile  if they continue to impose this war on us  the people of the world should know that we shall never renounce our rights or betray the many people who today see a ray of hope in our revolution  because  as our hero Sandino said ""My cause is the cause of my people  the cause of America  the cause of all the peoples of the world."""
"100",5187,"NLD",41,1986,"May I begin  first of all  by congratulating the President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly upon his election and commend him for the prominent role his country plays in many international forums  such as the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation  to name just a few. All of us know full well what his country  Bangladesh  has done in these forums. They have amply benefited from the President's outstanding personal qualities of leadership  initiative and sense of compromise  and I can assure him that we have full confidence in his presidency.My esteemed colleague Sir Geoffrey Howe  the Foreign Minister of the united Kingdom  has expressed the views of the 12 member States of the European Community on some major international problems before the General Assembly. A memorandum was circulated as a companion piece to his speech. The Nether lands fully subscribes to the views expressed on that occasion. European unity is a cornerstone of Netherlands foreign policy. European integration is of course not an inward-looking process. The ongoing construction of Europe obliges the Twelve concurrently to play their appropriate role in the international community. The Twelve accept the responsibilities in world affairs which their joint capabilities impose on them.Since last year's session of the General Assembly the international atmosphere seems to have improved. The meeting of President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev last autumn opened up prospects for a better and a more rational relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and helped to bring about a certain easing of tensions between East and West. Hope for the future can be derived too from the successful outcome of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. Indeed  significant new avenues seem to have been opened as far as verification and inspection are concerned. Last year  we also saw democracy gaining further ground  notably in Latin America and in the Philippines. In international economic co-operation there is a certain promise of a realistic accommodation of interests  as just witnessed by the outcome of the Conference in Punta del Este in Uruguay.The tragic nuclear accident in Chernobyl has increased our awareness of our shared responsibility. The consensus within the International Atomic Energy Agency on notification and assistance in case of nuclear accidents testifies to this.These hopeful developments should not  however  make us overlook the fact that . in many parts of the world armed conflicts continue unabated with their heavy toll of human lives. In South Africa the abhorrent system of apartheid continues to breed violence. In many countries the scourge of terrorism is making itself felt increasingly. This vicious phenomenon  which strikes at innocent people  should be eradicated by the joint efforts of us all.What is the context in which we have to place all these developments? The time we live in is characterized by rapid change. Technological innovation propels mankind into a new phase in its historical evolution. The information society that awaits us imposes new demands upon individuals and organizations. A premium is set on flexibility  adaptability  participation and initiative. The individual has an essential role to play in this process. The modern age does not stop at the doorstep of the United Nations. The Organization will have to change and adapt to these changing times too. The outside world  I think  is tired of rhetoric  ideological polarization and worn-out procedures. There seems to be a new tendency towards pragmatism and businesslike attitudes  without which  evidently  we cannot achieve our ideals.Recent experience has demonstrated that when the Organization puts its mind to it  when it concentrates its efforts upon a concrete challenge and when the Member States take a constructive stand  it can function effectively and accomplish something. Let me give two examples  both of which concern Africa.The establishment almost two years ago of the Office for Emergency Operations in Africa (OEQA) under the able leadership of Mr. Bradford Morse  has proved to be an adequate reaction of the United Nations system to the alarming famine in large parts of Africa at that time. In our view  the Office has performed well in co-ordinating  often under difficult circumstances  the emergency assistance flowing into Africa's drought-stricken countries from so many sources.Furthermore  Member States have demonstrated their ability to co-operate in a constructive manner during the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the critical economic situation in Africa. That was a well-prepared and efficient session that produced a genuine consensus on concrete steps to put the African countries back on a track to sustained economic development. The United Nations proved that it can be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations  in the way foreseen in its Charter.Values and ideas are essential to guide nations. Differences in ideologies and cultures are a fact of life  but polarization and mutual recrimination are not their inevitable corollary. If we are unable to engage in a serious dialog  the future of the United Nations would look grim indeed. What is required are concrete results through real negotiations.We need genuine consensus  not the adoption of phraseology that papers over fundamental differences of opinion. Recent United Nations conferences on major international political issues have once more demonstrated how the unfortunate practice of false consensus has further developed over the years - and that is  of course  not the road to follow. I am convinced that there is sufficient convergence on quite a number of issues to enable our Organization to function as a forum where meaningful results can be achieved. Equally essential for the functioning of the United Nations is respect for its Charter. The concept of universality  which is fundamental to the Organization  requires the admission of countries like the Republic of Korea. The Charter also provides means for the peaceful settlement of conflicts. It is regrettable that quite a number of Member States seem reluctant to avail themselves of these tools and that so few States recognize the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. I submit that international adjudication should be more frequently utilized and that the Court should be called in more frequently. However  its prestige will  be threatened if it is misused for short-term political advantage.As we all know  the Organization is faced with a severe financial crisis. Its causes go well beyond the question of arrears and withholdings of Member States. The financial crisis in itself reflects political dissent among the Members of the United Nations. NO doubt the present crisis  if left unresolved  would soon become an institutional one  jeopardizing the viability and integrity of the whole Organization. Apart from the urgent task of balancing the budget  the financial crisis requires long-term structural solutions. It is clear that to solve the present impasse Member States will have to fulfill their obligations under the Charter. In addition  rational management and program evaluation techniques will have to be applied. As Lloyd George once said:""Don't be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated. You can't cross a chasm in two small jumps."" The General Assembly should not shy away from taking such a big step.The report of the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations -the so-called Group of 18 - provides  in our view  a highly appropriate basis for further decision-making by this Assembly. We strongly support the general thrustof the recommendations contained in the report of the Group of 18. It is essential that this Assembly build upon that Group's valuable work. The agreement should be expanded to areas for which the Group was  regrettably  not able to formulate unanimous recommendations. I refer to the procedures and mechanisms for programming and budgeting  including a broadening of the mandate of the Committee for program and Co-ordination.As far as the Secretariat is concerned  the Secretary-General bears primary responsibility as the Organization's chief administrative officer. He has ably assumed these responsibilities by consistently providing Member States with clear and revealing insight into the gravity of the crisis  and has not hesitated to take effective measures. In his annual report the Secretary-General has outlined the causes underlying the present crisis and their implications? he fully recognizes the need for improved management of the Secretariat at all levels  improved co-ordination and streamlining of various departments. We agree with his observations on the need for re-examination of the structure  staff and procedures aimed at bringing about a tighter  less costly Secretariat. We support his efforts and expect continued leadership in pursuance of more efficiency and streamlining of the Secretariat.But streamlining and personnel cuts are not enough. Furthermore  such measures cannot be properly carried out in isolation; they should be accompanied by a reform of the intergovernmental machinery and its functioning. Over the years we have  as the Group of 18 correctly notes  built an overly complex structure which suffers from a lack of cohesion and makes co-ordination extremely difficult  if not impossible. The Netherlands is of the opinion that a long-term solution to the present crisis must be found in the achievement of a more compact  coherent andeffective program. We  the Member States  should give guidance for the rationalization of the Organization and set priorities on the basis of an agreed level and cot tent of the program budget. This is a major challenge for this Assembly.On the subject of working methods  we feel that an overloading of agenda items should be avoided. In general  it does not seem wise to duplicate in the United Nations work done in specialized forums  such as the Inter national Monetary Fund (IMF) on debt and the World Bank in the field of long-term financing for structural change. Tackling clusters of important issues  one at a time  in the appropriate forums  might well prove to open up possibilities for step-by-step improvements. Through the Economic and Social Council and the Second Committee the United Nations seems particularly well placed to assure that the outcome of sectoral discussions are related to each other and perceived in their interrelationship. With this in mind  my Government will also actively contribute to a constructive European approach in the new round on liberalization of trade in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).Whatever the problems and shortcomings of the United Nations may be  we certainly do not ewer lode the many achievements of the Organization and all its affiliates. For instance  I have in mind the important work that the United Nations is doing in setting standards and norms in the legal field. The same applies to its policy-making and supervisory functions on social and humanitarian scores. I think also that no one will doubt that the Organization has proved itself capable of doing fundamental and innovative work in the human-rights field  setting standards and monitoring their implementation.It is appropriate in this context to point to the common declaration of the States members of the European Community last July in which they set out the basicobjectives of their human-rights policy. That declaration  which the Netherlands was privileged to initiate  underlines once more that respect for human rights is one of the cornerstones of European co-operation.One of the most successful achievements of the United Nations system is its aid to developing countries  in all the major economic  social and cultural sectors the United Nations is active through its aid organs and specialized agencies.My country will remain one of the strong supporters of the multilateral aid fabric of the United Nations. In this respect I should like to stress that the Government of the Netherlands has again committed itself to continue to provide 1.5 per cent of the Netherlands net national income for development co-operation  roughly equivalent to $2 billion a year.Many of the specialized agencies and other United Nations bodies have been demonstrating for a long time that practical and beneficial activities are possible without the systematic introduction of extraneous political and ideological issues. To our regret  however  that is not always the case. Take fear instance the developments in the Committee on Information  where the deliberations are moving away from the consensus on the development of a new world information and communications order which had been achieved within the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). We deem it essential that that consensus be restored. All the same I should not hide from this Assembly the serious concern of the Netherlands Government about the lack of progress UNESCO displays in implementing the reforms decided upon in Sofia last auturcn. If UNESCO fails to carry out the Sofia decisions in a satisfactory way  I regret to say that the Nether lands might be forced ultimately to reconsider its position towards that organization.The maintenance of international peace and security remains a primary task of the United Nations  as laid down in the Charter. It has been only moderately successful in this field and many problems remain unsolved year after year  as  for instance  a glance at southern Africa and the Middle East sadly underlines. The views of my Government on those conflicts are well known. As President of the European Political Co-operation during the first half of this year I was once more reminded how intricate and complex these issues are and how little progress wasactually achieved. But if one looks at the Middle East  an I right when  in spite of all the dark clouds  I detect a glimmer of hope in recent developments? Is it too daring to assume after all that 1987 could be the year of real peace negotiations in the Middle East and notably that the forces in favor of genuine dialog could gain further momentum?As for South Africa  change is long overdue and the situation is deteriorating further. We must therefore continue to apply the necessary pressure on the Government of Pretoria to bring about the eradication of the unacceptable system of apartheid. Together with its European partners  the Kingdom of the Netherlands will continue its efforts towards promoting in South Africa a genuine dialog across lines of color  politics and religion  in order to achieve this the Netherlands is committed to a meaningful program of political action  consisting both of economic sanctions and of measures aimed at strengthening within South Africa the forces for peaceful change. In addition to the economic sanctions already decided upon  the Twelve have agreed that the presidency will continue to seek a consensus on a ban on the import of coal from South Africa.But here also  at the United Nations  let us concert our actions. In our common total rejection of apartheid we should not let our indignation work to the detriment of our ability to find common ground for ways of bringing about a just society within which all South Africans will be able to enjoy their legitimate rights.The bitter war between Iraq and Iran has just entered its seventh year. The international community should spare no effort to bring the parties to the negotiating table in order to put an end to that senseless war. However  even where peace has not been restored  the rules of humanitarian law must be strictly observed: no chemical weapons must be used  civilian life must be spared.prisoners of war must be treated in accordance with the relevant conventions  the war oust not be extended to the territory of surrounding States and shipping in the Gulf must not be interfered with.The continuing occupation of Afghanistan  which causes so much misery to the Afghan people  casts a dark shadow over global detente. The occupying Power bears a heavy responsibility not only towards the Afghan people but also towards the international community as a whole. An ever increasing majority in this Assembly also rejects the occupation of Kampuchea. As in the case of Afghanistan  the General Assembly has clearly indicated the principles on which a solution should be based.As far as Central America is concerned  I feel that the Contadora countries deserve our sincere appreciation. Their unrelenting efforts  seconded by the Support Group  have not yet yielded the results hoped for. We believe that it is now up to the Central American countries to bridge their differences.In Chile we have recently witnessed an intensification of repression. There  too  the restoration of democracy is long overdue and the initiation of a dialog with the democratic opposition is more than ever called for.The world is not the safe place mankind dreamed about more than 40 years ago. Wars continue to be fought. The deterrence value of nuclear weapons has its mirror image in the immense powers of destruction of those systems. With another summit meeting between the United States and the Soviet Union in sight - as we hope - we expect that effective agreements on substantive and verifiable arms control which would drastically reduce nuclear arsenals will emerge. We believe that in parallel with such reductions nuclear testing could also be reduced. The conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty remains as necessary as ever  and we remain committed to it. Let us therefore resume our work in Geneva on this issue without further delay. The successful outcome of the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference a year ago reaffirmed and even enhanced the strength and vitality of that Treaty. It remains a cornerstone in our endeavors to uphold an effective non-proliferation regime  to the common good of all. It remains equally important that outer space should not become an area of competition between the super-Powers.We attach great importance to the earliest possible conclusion of a total ban cn chemical weapons. It is encouraging that some progress was achieved in Geneva last summer and this should be built upon. The Netherlands is fully aware that a great deal remains to be done. My country made a modest contribution when it organized a workshop on the important issue of verification earlier this year. I hope that the ideas and concepts which sprang from that meeting will bear fruit.Ours is an era of rapid change. That is as true for the Netherlands as for any place in the world. In its constitutional structure  the Kingdom of the Netherlands has recently undergone an important adjustment. The island of Aruba  which formed part of the Netherlands Antilles  became a separate entity within the Kingdom of the Netherlands as from 1 January 1986. That decision  which honored the expressed wish of the people of Aruba  was readied after close consultations within the framework of the Kingdom and after the approval of the respective parliaments. As a result  the Kingdom now consists of three equal partners. This development does not entail any alteration in the relations between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and other countries or international organizations and I am confident that this new structure will be a factor in promoting prosperity and stability in the region. As the General Assembly convenes for its forty-first session the international picture looks  as I mentioned in my introductory remarks  somewhat brighter than it did when we met last year. It is hoped that a summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union will pave the way for a further improvement in international relations. The United Nations has a role of its own to play in this process. It will  however  be able to play that role only if it manages to get its act together  to focus its efforts effectively on the search for concrete solutions. Recent examples have confirmed our conviction that the United Nations can be an effective actor in international affairs. We sincerely hope that the United Nations will be allowed to stand up  and will prove capable of standing up  to the challenges of what is to be our common future."
"101",5232,"NOR",41,1986,"Sir  allow me first of all to congratulate youupon your election to the high office of President of the forty-first session ofthe General Assembly. I am convinced that its work will benefit from yourexperience and knowledge.At the beginning of this session of the General Assembly  the future of the East-West relations is a central concern in all corners of the globe.The future of East-West relations encompasses the decisive questions of ourtimes: war or peace  disarmament or continued arms race  peaceful co-operation orconfrontation  mutual confidence or distrust. The East-West relationship largelydetermines the international climate and indeed sets limits to what can be achievedalso in other areas which are in urgent need of attention  such as the North-Southrelationship and the global challenges of development  environment  trade andfinance. These are questions of fundamental importance to the future of mankind which we cannot afford to go on neglecting. Also for this reason we need a newbeginning in East-West relations which can liberate energies and resources.Achievements that have already been made must therefore be carefully protectedand preserved  such as the anti-ballistic missile Treaty  which indeed plays avital role.The Geneva negotiations are of fundamental importance to the future of East-West relations. They must give us the answer to the key question of whether it will be possible to turn the tide of the arms race. Without real progress in the field of disarmament and arms control  our efforts at dialog and co-operation in other areas will be seriously limited.So far  we have not seen tangible results in the form of any decisive progress in arms negotiations. Prom the Norwegian side we have wholeheartedly endorsed the broad aim of the Geneva negotiations  which should be conducted with a view to""... preventing an arms race in space and terminating it on earth by limiting and reducing nuclear arms and strengthening strategic stability ...""This very promising result of last year's summit meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev is an agreement on broad objectives that it is essential for us to retain.The Helsinki process now sorely needs a vitamin injection and new impetus to become a positive  dynamic factor in East-West relations. The breakthrough at the Stockholm Conference announced today is not only an important achievement  but also has a potential for further progress. If we now experience an improved atmosphere in the vital area of arms control and disarmament  it could mark a historic moment.In Stockholm  a new generation of confidence and security building measures have been adopted  and major concessions have been given - concessions that will lead to reduced risks  and to greater openness and predictability all over Europe.But we need higher aspirations. Regularity in the political dialog at the highest level between the super-Powers is an imperative for stability and predictability in East-West relations. Pending questions that hamper a new summit now urgently need solutions to pave the way for new agreements in Geneva.The work undertaken in multilateral disarmament forums is also of crucial importance  both as an expression of wide public concern and for negotiating global disarmament agreements. The nuclear test ban issue remains a vital question. Efforts here should be further intensified. It is our hope that this session of the General Assembly will contribute to expediting the work of the Conference on Disarmament in order to reach agreement cm a comprehensive test ban.It still has not been possible to reach agreement on a treaty banning chemical weapons  although important progress has been made. Indecent use of these abhorrent weapons underlines the need to eradicate them once and for all. As we work towards an end to the arms race on earth  we must at the same time seek to prevent a spread of the arms race into outer space. It is our firm belief that outer space must be reserved for peaceful purposes exclusively. We fully support the efforts to that end in the United Nations and in the Conference on Disarmament. The irrationality of the arms race is most amply demonstrated by the global imbalance between the resources spent on armaments and what is devoted to development. This fundamental problem should indeed be a matter of concern for the entire world community. Norway  therefore  supports the idea of holding the United Nations conference on disarmament and development as soon as possible.Last year the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations was solemnly commemorated in this Assembly Hall. Political leaders from all over the world came here to pay a tribute to the Organization. It was seen as an expression of support for multilateralism as a basic concept and working method in international affairs.Past experience has shown us that there is no alternative to global co-operation in the striving for peace and security  for economic and social development and for the protection of human rights.In spite of the many pledges made in this Hall last year  the political and economic problems on the agenda of the United Nations persist  and in the past year there has been hardly any progress on major issues before the Organization. In addition  the United Nations itself has for some time now experienced severe financial problems caused by significant withholdings of assessed contributions on the part of several Member states. These withholdings  together with the lack of budgetary discipline  in fact threaten seriously to undermine the viability of the United Nations.The Norwegian Government is deeply committed to multilateralism and to a strong United Nations; and the objective need of the world community is greater today than it was when the Organization was created 41 years ago.The financial crisis is the manifestation of a fundamental crisis of credibility which has been festering for some time. There has been a widespread and deepening loss of confidence in the United Nations on the part.of many Member States and their publics that believe that the Organization is not sufficiently effective in meeting its original objectives or in serving the interests of its Members.Even the strongest champions of the United Nations - countries like Norway and many others - must now concede that these concerns have some validity. The political and economic issues on the agenda of the United Nations persist. Its budget is burdened by unnecessary duplication and overlapping of functions  and the budgetary process lacks the discipline required to evoke the full support of all Member States.The task of renewing the effectiveness of the United Nations is basically political in nature. It requires that Member States manifest the political will to place the financing of the Organization on a viable basis and provide the Secretary-General with the mandate and the support he needs to carry out the major organization  staffing and budget changes which will reduce costs  improve effectiveness and restore confidence. At this forty-first session we have a unique opportunity to do exactly that. It is an opportunity we must not miss.We have before us the report of the Group of High-Level intergovernmental Experts - the Group of 18 - established last year by unanimous decision of the General Assembly to examine and suggest improvements in the Organization's administration and finances. The Norwegian Government fully supports these recommendations and urges the Assembly to approve them in their entirety.These recommendations are only the beginning of a reform process in the United Nations  a process which will be painful and which will necessarily take time. It is essential that this transformation be allowed to take place in an orderly and responsible manner  and that Member States indeed co-operate closely with the Secretary-General in the difficult task he faces in implementing these changes.Earlier this year  for the first time in the history of the United Nations  attention was focused on the economic and social problems of one single continent. The special session on the critical situation in Africa was an important element in the United Nations efforts to assist African countries in surmounting their grave economic and ecological crisis.Based on the thorough preparations made by the Organization of African Unity and its member States  the special session adopted unanimously a program of action for African economic recovery and development for 1986-1990.We managed to set up a common point of reference  where the mutual commitments . of Africa and the international community are elaborated. The consensus that was reached on this document must be seen as a notable achievement. However  the final evaluation of that session can only be made in the future. The follow-up action must be pursued energetically on the national  regional and international levels.We witness  with respect and admiration  the valiant efforts undertaken-by African countries to initiate new economic policies. However  interdependence is today a living reality. The African countries will succeed only if the international community agrees to complement these efforts with new and increased assistance.Norway pledges its full and continued suppoit to the African development efforts.One area where the United Nations has a special responsibility and where we hope that the Organization may play a decisive role is the question of South Africa and Namibia.The situation in South Africa has reached an explosive stage. The black majority is no longer willing to tolerate the aggressive apartheid system and is demanding the obvious right to be treated as equal citizens with full political rights. Instead of addressing these legitimate demands  the South African Government has once again resorted to the desperate means of declaring a state of emergency and detaining hundreds of apartheid opponents. This policy will only lead to prolonged suffering and bloodshed in South Africa.The dramatic events should not make us forget that South Africa continues its illegal occupation of Namibia  in violation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). This issue was dealt with extensively at last week's special session on Namibia  and I should like to repeat our demand to the South African Governmentto agree to the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia without any further delay.The policy of trying to abolish apartheid through a dialog with the South African Government has been tried repeatedly without success. In its recent report for the Commonwealth eminent persons group draws the depressing conclusion that the South African Government does not seen to be prepared for a genuine dialog with the opposition and that outside pressure is essential for any prospect of peaceful change. My Government strongly supports these conclusions. Some countries  even so  continue to argue against sanctions  on the ground that sanctions will create increased suffering for the blade population and cause economic difficulties for the neighboring countries of South Africa. We do not underestimate those difficulties. But  even though sanctions may cause hardships in the short run  representative black leaders argue that that is preferable to the prolonged suffering that apartheid implies. We think it is wise to listen to those leaders. In fact  we feel there is an obligation to do so. The Norwegian Government therefore urges the Security Council to impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa. We also propose that the United Nations prepare a contingency plan for assistance to South Africa's neighbors in the event of South African reprisals against those countries.Norway has repeatedly advocated comprehensive  mandatory sanctions against South Africa. I take this opportunity to urge those countries that still oppose sanctions to reassess their attitude.The absence of binding sanctions should not be used as a pretext for failing to act against apartheid. Measures by individual countries or groups of countries are also important  in order to signal disapproval of apartheid and express solidarity with those who work for changes in South Africa.My Government believes that an effective oil embargo would be an important measure against South Africa. For that reason we were pleased to host a United Nations seminar on the oil embargo in Oslo in June this year  in preparation for the United Nations World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  held in Paris. The proposal to set up an international monitoring mechanism on the supply of oil to South Africa was included in the Final Declaration of the Paris Conference  and we hope that the Security Council will be able to support this idea  with a view to achieving an effective oil embargo against South Africa.In addition to the measures contained in the Nordic program of Action  Norway has adopted a number of unilateral measures. My Government is now preparing a bill on an economic boycott of South Africa  a bill which is expected to be decided upon by the Norwegian Parliament this autumn. In this way we want to make our contribution to bringing about a South Africa with equal rights and opportunities for all. He also hope to inspire other countries to follow suit  to increase the total international pressure against apartheid.Time is running out for peaceful solutions. If apartheid is not abolished soon  the whole region of southern Africa may explode in a bloody upheaval. I appeal to every nation to move forward in taking effective action against apartheid.From this rostrum world leaders have rightly been warning of the threats to the survival of mankind caused by existing nuclear arsenals  regional conflicts and failures of the development process.Interdependence is becoming the dominant characteristic of the whole range of issues relating to development. It encompasses broad security concerns  environmental and ecological issues  and economic and cultural relations. There is also the geographical dimension of interdependence  regionally and globally. The nuclear accident at Chernobyl highlighted the awesome problems we shall face across the borders in the event of a nuclear disaster occurring in any one country. The rapid population growth in many countries is creating migration patterns which strain both national and cross-national systems. In the trade aid financial area we see the mutual dependence of creditors and debtors  as well as the vital .link between a non-protectionist trade regime and the ability of debtor countries to meet their debt obligations and generate the necessary resources for their own development.his is really the essence of the North-South dialog: how the growing inter-linkages between issues and interdependence between nations create an increasing number of problems that transcend national systems and require solutions of a global nature. The need for a global approach is clear  but it does not mean that all problems have to be negotiated and solved simultaneously. What it means is that global perspectives must permeate all the processes and the work we are engaged in  and that this is becoming more and more urgent. Protection of the environment and development are essential and mutually reinforcing goals. This requires that environmental considerations be built into development projects ~ t the earliest possible stage. Otherwise  they will not be economically sustainable.In recent years the world has become increasingly aware that the negligence of interactions between the environment and development is already seriously threatening the ability of the planet to sustain life for present and future generations. The threats of war and regional conflicts are the concern of us all  but so also are critical life support systems that are now at stake. The world Commission on Environment and Development  which is to report to the General Assembly next year  is convinced that these new imperatives can be seriously addressed only by defining the goals of economic activity in terms of sustainable development.Sustainable development will require a recovery from the economic stagnation of recent years and indeed a new era of growth in the world economy. But it cannot be a repetition of the non-sustainable development patterns of the past decades  which resulted in the development crisis of the 1980s. A new era of growth must be built on new patterns of the development and on a unification of ecology and economics.The earth is one  but the world of man is not. Mankind shares a common origin and a common future. Short-sighted self-interest has misled the human race to over-exploitation of the troubled planet. We have been heavily overdrawing the account which nature opened for us. But the unsustainable trends can be rectified. We must formulate and adopt new strategies to secure a sustainable common future.The opportunities are in fact there. Now it is time for us to act."
"102",5278,"NPL",41,1986,"I have the honor to convey to you  and through you to the members of this Assembly  greetings from my Sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikran Shah Dev  and his best wishes for the success of the forty-first session of the General Assembly.On behalf of ray delegation  and on my own  I have great pleasure in extending warm and cordial felicitations to you. Sir  on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. It is as much a tribute to your country  Bangladesh  which is deeply committed to the principles of the United Nations and with which Nepal enjoys excellent neighborly relations  as it is recognition of your own personal qualities and contributions for which we in Nepal have high regard. My delegation is convinced that under your able and wise stewardship the Assembly will achieve all desired results.We take particular pride in the fact that such an eminent representative of South Asia should be called upon to preside over a session of the General Assembly so soon after the formal establishment of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC).At this time  I should also like to place on record the deep appreciation of my delegation to Mr. Jaime de Pinies of Spain  who presided over the memorable fortieth session of the General Assembly with such impartiality and distinction. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his continuing contribution to the cause of international peace and co-operation. We gratefully acknowledge his tireless efforts to strengthen and rejuvenate the United Nations in the past  confident that they will continue into the future as well.Only last year we observed with due solemnity the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. We then collectively reviewed the achievements and shortcomings of the United Nations in the four decades of its existence. We were elated at the many successes of the United Nations but dismayed that more could not be achieved. And the sense of disappointment was nowhere perhaps more palpable than in the all-important sphere relating to international peace and security.A significant and positive outcome of the fortieth session of the General Assembly was the proclamation to designate 1986 as the International Year of Peace. This has provided not only an opportunity for all of us to recommit ourselves to the cause of the promotion of peace - the principal purpose of the United Nations - but also to focus on its problems and prospects. Thus  though none of us present here can confidently declare the world is more secure in 1986 than in any preceding year because of the activities spurred  world-wide  by observance of the International Year of Peace  it must be acknowledged that there is now perhaps a better appreciation of the fact that global peace must be defined and nurtured in its totality. It is with considerable pleasure  therefore  that I can convey to this Assembly the fact that  in keeping with the United Nations resolution  the International Year of Peace is being observed in Nepal in a variety of ways designed not only to stimulate practical and concerted actions for peace but also to provide opportunities for serious reflection on its nature and condition. Among them are plans for lighting an eternal peace flame in Lumbini -the birthplace of that great apostle of peace and goodwill  Lord Gautam Buddah -from the peace torch that  at this time  is going around the globe as part of the First Earth Run which was inaugurated by the Secretary-General earlier this month.  Mention has already been made of the fact that real prospects for global peace and security were not enhanced in 1986 as they ought to have or could have been. The reasons for this are not far to seek. Primarily  of course  they can be traced to the fact that where the all-important question of nuclear war and the arras race is concerned no headway has been Bade in 1986. Indeed  though the process of dialog initiated between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Geneva last November was encouraging and was welcomed as such  it has still to lead to another summit where concrete measures designed to promote the cause of peace can be agreed upon between the two super-Powers.As it is  there has been no forward motion on scaling down the nuclear arms race  though this is not due to want of worth-while proposals. Indeed  bold and attractive offers for reducing long-range nuclear weapons  freezing nuclear arsenals at pre-determined levels and banning their deployment outside national borders and eliminating them altogether before the end of the century have been made. However  not only have they all been rejected on one or another ground  but the four-times unilaterally extended moratorium on nuclear testing by the Soviet Union has not been reciprocated by the United States either. Thus  even as the glow from the United States-Soviet summit meeting in Geneva last November rapidly faded  uncompromising endeavors to hurtle the nuclear arms competition into the arena of outer space - a common heritage of mankind - continued unabated. It is no comfort  in the meantime  to have to be reminded how vulnerable peoples everywhere are to the dangers of nuclear radiation  even in peacetime.The tragedy is that  even in the year designated by the United Nations the International Year of Peace  there is no universal acceptance that in a nuclear age national security cannot be secured by unilateral means; that the mutual vulnerability of the super-Powers is an essential characteristic of our times; or even that the most effective first step in arresting the nuclear arms race is a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.The Nepalese delegation is convinced that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty would represent a turning point in the history of arms control by making such negotiations free from the pressure of constant technological developments. Also  apart from the fact that a specific commitment by the major nuclear Powers has been enshrined in various international agreements  including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  it is now technically possible to verify nuclear-weapon testing.Yet  while it is clear that the very first priority on the global agenda must be to halt  then reverse and ultimately end nuclear armament  my delegation is also deeply concerned about the extension of super-Power confrontation in various parts of the world  including the Indian Ocean region.No less disturbing is it to my delegation to note that a great many developing countries are themselves indulging in expensive and unbridled arms competition in conventional weaponry  with some even assuming the status of major arras suppliers or exporters.To its great distress  ray delegation notes that  despite the pledges and spirit of the International Year of Peace  1986  what was expected to be a historic International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development had to be postponed despite the great interest the Conference had naturally sparked and the convening in the United Nations of a number of preparatory meetings for the Conference. My delegation had been looking forward to the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development with much anticipation. Quite apart from the fact that Nepal has always championed the cause of general and complete disarmament  what bears particular recollection in this context is that it was precisely because of the close and intimate connection between peace and development that His Majesty King Birendra proposed in 1375 that Nepal bs declared a zone of peace  a proposal that I feel much gratified to state has received the support of 79 countries thus far  for which I take the opportunity to express our gratitude.I wish also to reiterate that Nepal's peace initiative  rooted as it is in the idea of institutionalizing peace in what is a geostrategic part of the Indian Ocean hinterland  is in conformity with the ideals of the United Nations and the principles embodied in its Charter  as well as those of the Non-Aligned Movement  of which Nepal is a proud founding member. We also believe that it will act as a complement to  and not detract from  other worthy peace initiatives  whether they relate to the South Pacific  the South Atlantic  South or South-East Asia  the Mediterranean  the Indian Ocean or even the African continent as a whole.As we survey the world political situation we are naturally dismayed that no progress has been recorded as far as resolving the familiar and hemorrhaging  conflicts of yesteryear is concerned. Indeed  pernicious tendencies for the strong to dominate the weak continue.It is the altogether depressing reflex of some to settle scores  real or imagined  by actual resort to arms or to crude threats to do so. The sacrosanct doctrine of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of sovereign States is trampled underfoot. Decades-old injustices and tyrannies  created by myths and prejudices of racial superiority  continue with impunity. Terrorism shows its ugly visage every now and then  too often accompanied by outbursts of horrific deeds and the spilling of innocent blood. And East-West rivalry exacerbates regional tensions and conflicts.A sense of hopelessness and futility pervades west Asia  where the cycle of death  destruction and despair continues its grim progression. In other words  theprospects for peace in West Asia not one iota brighter in the International Year of Peace than at any time in the past few turbulent decades.As far as my delegation is concerned  we remain firm in our belief that a lasting solution to the problems besetting West Asia will continue to elude the international community unless the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and a homeland of their own in that region is universally accepted. Nepal is also convinced that a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in West Asia cannot be achieved unless it is recognized that all States of the region  including Israel  have the inalienable right to exist within secure and well-defined boundaries - that is to say  the right to independent sovereign existence free from threats and acts of force. Finally  the third vital element in any comprehensive peace settlement for West Asia  in Nepal's view  is the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from territories occupied since 1967.The situation in Lebanon exemplifies to a very great degree the tragedy and dilemmas of West Asia  providing as it does an ongoing stage for invasion  civil strife and the clash of competing foreign interests. Nepal has long viewed with concern the challenges to the sovereignty of that small and independent country  especially the suggestion that a part of that sovereign and proud country should be considered as falling within the defense perimeter of an adjacent neighbor. As a small  independent and peace-loving country that desires to be a zone of peace  Nepal is proud to be contributing  in however modest a way  to the cause of peace in southern Lebanon through participation in United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) operations. Nepal will continue to support any peace initiative that restores full and legitimate Lebanese sovereignty over the whole of Lebanon and secures the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the acceptance by all concerned of the need for non-interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon.I take this opportunity to reiterate Nepal's appeal to Iran and Iraq  fellow members of the Non-Aligned Movement  to forsake armed conflict and seek a peaceful settlement of their dispute.Similarly  Nepal renews its call for a peaceful settlement of the Cyprus problem and reiterates its support for the territorial integrity  independence  sovereignty and ncn-aligned character of Cyprus. It is the view of my delegation that inter communal talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General offer the best hope of achieving a satisfactory am' lasting solution.The situation in Afghanistan  despite the best efforts of the Secretary-General's special envoy  Mr. Diego Cordovez  continues to be a source of tension in the region and a cause of deep anxiety for people everywhere  involving as it does the potential for a super-Power confrontation. It is distressing that all norms of inter-State behavior are being violated in Afghanistan through a  continued and prolonged foreign military presence.This Assembly has more than once in the past unequivocally pointed out what the essentials of a satisfactory political solution of the problem in Afghanistan are. These entail the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghan is tan  the return of Afghan refugees to their homeland in dignity and honor and their participation along with others in determining their own political destiny free from outside interference or intervention.Similarly  Nepal is deeply concerned about the situation in Kampuchea. Nepal notes with regret that  despite the continuing concern of the international community regarding the Kampuchean issue  as reflected in the relevant General Assembly resolutions and the Declaration on Kampuchea adopted by the International Conference  the prospects for peace and tranquility in the land of Ankgor Wat have not improved appreciably.While taking positive note of the recent diplomatic initiatives and contacts in this context  Nepal calls for a just and lasting resolution of the Kampuchean problem. We reiterate our demand for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea  the restoration and preservation of its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and respect for the inalienable right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own destiny without outside interference. Such an approach  we are convinced  would not only contribute to the establishment of peace in Kampuchea but also greatly assist in making South East Asia a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  a concept which Nepal heartily endorses.North East Asia too has for many years remained a source of considerable anxiety  in particular the politically divided Korean peninsula. Once the arena of an awesome global conflict  the Korean peninsula still retains its highly explosive potential. It is imperative in the interests of regional and international peace and security  therefore  that the tense situation in the Korean peninsula be defused. This  we are convinced  can best be achieved by the peaceful national reunification of Korea without any outside interference.My delegation has just expressed its concern regarding the situation obtaining in several parts of the Asian continent  which is conditioned by Nepal's well known commitment to peace and its conviction that the doctrine of non-interference and non-intervention must remain inviolable if the principles and ideals of the United Nations Charter are to continue to have any meaning or relevance.It is therefore only logical that my delegation should view with alarm and distress recent developments in Central America. We consider it essential that outside Powers should refrain from actions aimed at setting in motion forces of instability and tension in that region. I therefore take this opportunity to reiterate Nepal's endorsement of Security Council resolution 530 (1983)  which reaffirm the right of all the States of the region to live in peace and freedom  as well as its support for the admirable efforts of the Contadora Group to bring about a peaceful resolution of the problem of sovereignty  independence and honor for all the States of Central America.Turning now to the African continent  ray delegation is outraged by the manner in which the racist regime in South Africa continues to suppress  exploit and dehumanize its blade majority under the socially unjust  morally indefensible and brazenly racist policy of apartheid. Nepal is fully convinced that the unmitigated evil of apartheid  the source of acute suffering  deprivation and violence in South Africa and much of southern Africa  must be wiped once and for all from the face of the earth.We are fully convinced that the application of comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa represents the best and last chance that remains for peaceful change towards democratic majority rule in South Africa. We therefore join others  including fellow members of the Non-Aligned Movement  in urging the invoking of such sanctions against South Africa under chapter VII of the Charter  and are encouraged that public opinion in some Western countries that oppose sanctions is increasingly supporting the need for them and their effectiveness in expediting the long overdue political transformation in South Africa.Is it any surprise that a stubborn racist regime such as South Africa's should continue  with virtual impunity  to defy the will of the international community by continuing to delay the granting of immediate independence to Namibia  for which the United Nations has the sole responsibility? Nepal reaffirms its unwavering support for the struggle of the Namibian people for independence and salutes the South West Africa People's Organization for its heroic endeavors to achieve that laudable end. My delegation renews its call on the international Community tospeed endeavors to bring about the early implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions as well as the program of Action outlined by the Vienna International Conference on Immediate Independence for Namibia  which was endorsed by the General Assembly at its special session only last week.Nepal is seriously concerned about the problems of drug abuse and illicit trafficking  which require for their resolution the urgent collective attention of the international community. We therefore look forward eagerly to participating in the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Drug Trafficking  to be held in June next year in Vienna under the presidency of the Prime Minister of Malaysia  Mr. Mahatir bin Mohamad.Another serious problem of our times is the menace of terrorism  which appears of late to have taken a particularly virulent form and has involved the taking of innocent human lives. Since terrorism  in all or any of its manifestations  depends on spreading terror by the seeming randomness or senselessness of its incidence  it is a particularly vile and dangerous form of organized violence  especially in an age of easy access to weapons of mass destruction.My country would therefore join in any concerted international effort to help eradicate this scourge  including the effort sponsored by the United Nations. We were particularly gratified during the fortieth session of the General Assembly that the Security Council unanimously and unequivocally condemned all acts of hostage taking and abduction as well as terrorism in all its forms. We believe efforts in that direction must continue at both the international and the regional levels.It is for this reason that Nepal is encouraged that terrorism ~ which has yet to be defined by the United Nations - is also receiving due attention in regional forums  such as the recently launched South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC)  which  at its meeting last month in Dhaka  deliberated in depth on the problem.However  efforts to curb the menace of terrorism in South Asia are  as the Assembly is well aware  only one of the many areas that have been identified for co-operation among members of SAARC. Though the scope and significance of regional co-operation among the nations of South Asia is immense and a beginning only has been made in regional co-operation for the socio-economic development of the teeming millions of people in South Asia  I am pleased to say that the idea has  despite some early adverse predictions  very definitely  and happily  struck root. We believe that  apart from providing an effective instrument for co-operation in our region  the creation of SAARC comes at a time when the weakening of global economic independence and difficulties in the restructuring of the international economic order mean that there are greater responsibilities than ever before on South-South co-operation.Mr. President  my delegation shares your view  expressed in your eloquent opening address to the forty-first session of the General Assembly  that for some time now the world economy has presented a sombre picture. This is due  as was underscored at the recent summit meeting of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Harare earlier this month  to a crisis in the international economic situation itself. As all developing countries are only too painfully aware  this is manifested in imbalances and inequities that work against their economic well-being.As was also noted in Harare  this gloomy situation has been further aggravated by the myopic  self-centerED policies of some developed countries which favor neither the growth of the world economy nor structural reforms in the international economic system.My delegation is concerned about the effects of the continuing instability ofthe world economy and is conscious of the clear nexus that exists between trade money  finance and development. It is only natural  therefore  that Nepal shouldview with dismay and frustration the spectacle of steeply falling commodity prices triggering a further deterioration in the terms of trade of developing countries  a proliferation of protectionist trends and a general increase in discriminatory practices. All this has led not merely to disregard of the principles and practices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) but also to other trade restrictions that have been specially severe as far as the exports of the developing countries are concerned. At the same time  it has spurred high interest rates  monetary and financial instability  unmanageable and mounting external debt repayment burdens  a misalignment of exchange rates and  to top it all  a reverse transfer of scarce resources from the developing to the developed countries.The impact of these sombre developments on the international political and social climate is obvious and  indeed  awesome. Indeed  in this interdependent world of ours it reQuires no great prescience to realize that instability thus caused could not merely easily lead to domestic upheavals but ultimately constitute a threat to regional and international peace. As it is  it is most disconcerting to note that the harsh economic uncertainties facing the developing world  particularly the least developed countries  come at a time when there has been a decline in concessional flows. This being so  we cannot but regret that the official development aid target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product called for under the Third United Nations Development Decade  continues to remain unfulfilled.Similarly  we cannot remain indifferent to the fact that despite strong international coMmiitment official development assistance flows to the least developed countries have remained less than half the target of 0.15 per cent agreed to in the Substantial New program of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 198 s. As last year's mid-term review meeting on the implementation of that Substantial New program of Action demonstrated  there is a regrettable gap between the promises and the performance of the donors. While earnestly hoping for the attainment of the target of 0.15 per cent of their gross national product  or the doubling of their current official development assistance for the least developed countries  I take this opportunity to renew our appeal for effective implementation of the special measures adopted by the United Nations for land-locked developing countries.My delegation looks forward with considerable hope to both the forty-first session of the General Assembly and the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) resulting in constructive dialog between the developed and the developing nations towards identifying a common approach to the all-important interrelated problems regarding money  external debt  trade and development.I have already referred to the Harare summit of non-aligned countries in the context of its concern with regard to the world economic situation. As a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement  Nepal takes great pride in the advances which the Movement has recorded in its 25 years of existence in the worthy pursuit of peace and social and economic justice  based on the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.Nepal was not only honored to celebrate this peace movement's silver jubilee in Harare but particularly happy that the prestige and weight of the 101-member Movement could be brought to bear on a multitude of crucial political issues of our times  including especially those pertaining to the arms race and disarmament and to the situation in South Africa and Namibia. Nepal  I know  is not alone in believing that the Non-Aligned Movement continues to be as relevant today as when it was first founded at the height of the cold war.As usual  the agenda of the General Assembly is a full and wide-ranging one. Given the responsibilities of the United Nations  it could hardly be otherwise. In a sense  however  this year it will have an additional task: that of examining how the financial and administrative effectiveness of the Organization can be improved  as it must be  especially against the background of the financial crisis of the United Nations. We shall as usual lend our unstinting support to any endeavor that aims at preserving and strengthening the United Nations  for in Nepal's oft-stated view the alternative to the present United Nations can only be a stronger and more effective United Nations."
"103",5342,"NZL",41,1986,"Mr. President  I congratulate you on your election. We have a great deal of work to get through at this session. I know from my meeting with you yesterday that you will guide us skilfully through the rough water we will inevitably meet. Let me say  too  how good it is to see the Secretary-General restored to full health. We need his wisdom and courage at this time.I appear here today as the representative of a small country from the southern reaches of the vast Pacific Ocean. Forty years ago my country was amongst those which pledged their commitment to the objectives of this world Organization. How much nearer are we  today  to achieving those ideals? Enormous problems confront us. Technology has expanded humanity's horizons into outer space. But here on earth we have not yet succeeded in providing basic human needs - food  shelter  and at least a minimum degree of security - for all. Under the Charter we have all abjured the use or threat of force. Yet the most powerful nations among us seem unwilling to take the decisive step of rejecting the weapons of mass destruction that threaten us all. Today  more than ever before  small States need the protection that the Charter and this Organization were intended to give. The United Nations was intended to represent our interests  for the powerful are better able to look after themselves. If we who are small are not to be ignored by those who are mighty  then we must work together here to ensure the survival of this planet.New Zealanders know from recent experience that this Organization can respond quickly and fairly to the needs of small States which call for its help.In 1985 my country was suddenly embroiled in a dispute with France. It concerned the detonation of bombs fixed to a ship at a wharf in one of our harbors. A crewman of Dutch extraction lost his life. The circumstances were widely blazoned across the world press and need not be further recapitulated.Despite lengthy bilateral negotiations we were not able to solve the problem. With France  we then turned to the United Nations for help in finding an acceptable solution. Both countries undertook to abide unconditionally by the United Nations arbitration. The Secretary-General took on the task himself. He made a ruling which both Governments accepted without reservation. It has been carried out by both of us. I want to record my Government's profound gratitude to the Secretary-General for the commendable way he carried out that task. Through his mediator efforts we have been able to bring to an end that unhappy episode.Our experience in the field of decolonization has also shown us  once again  how this Organization can help us in fulfilling our obligations to bring dignity and self-respect to all people. My country is responsible for helping bring to nationhood a tiny territory in the South Pacific: Tokelau; remote  beautiful  but with few resources other than the fish in the sea around the three small atolls and the determination of its peoples. Our Government invited a United Nations visiting mission there in July to see the unique development issues confronting that atoll community. I am pleased to see members of the mission here today. We have found  as in the case of other island nations whose histories have been entwined with ours  that the United Nations could indeed make a useful and innovative contribution to the process leading to self-determination. That is an example that could well be followed again in another case in the South Pacific; and I shall return to that later.It is clear that the United Nations can help if small nations shew that they want it to do so. Nobody believes that problems that have bedeviled us for years will be solved overnight. But one thing is clear: whatever the issue -international security  the right to live in freedom and peace  or freeing the shackles on international trade - the small and the vulnerable have much more in common with one another than with the big Powers. Separately  we may achieve a little*  together we may yet move mountains  perhaps even the Rockies and the Urals.Today there is no greater incentive for us all to work together than the need to bring under control the fast-quickening nuclear-arms race. Arms control and disarmament are not pious goals; they are immediate and desperate imperatives. Nuclear weapons have become the subject of a monstrous exercise in self-perpetuation. We know now that none of us  even those in as remote a place as New Zealand  or more remote still  could escape the consequences of their use. All too graphically the scientists have shown us that.The central point  surely  must be that  when you have arsenals that can destroy humanity  you can have no security. By their very nature  nuclear weapons subvert and distort the intention of Governments to provide security for their people. So-called nuclear logic always seems to require the next terrible step: the production of a new weapon to prevent the last from being used. The ceaseless search for balance is really endless escalation; security  like a desert mirage  is never reached. We sink further into insecurity and fear. The balance of terror has been raised one more notch. It is well named. And despite the truly awesome consumption of resources  it seems we are edging towards yet another new and uncontrolled level of arms technology and spending. An arms race in outer space must not be permitted. Where one nuclear giant leads  the other will surely follow.Of course  the arms race does not exist in a vacuum. It is a reflection of deep-seated distrust and scarcely concealed hostility. Only earnest diplomatic action aimed at sincere detente will remove the distrust. Only decisive political action can end the arms race itself. No one underestimates the difficulty of managing the transition to a world without nuclear weapons  which must be the ultimate goal - but the nuclear ""logic"" that equates more nuclear weapons with greater security cannot be allowed to go on sabotaging the process of arms control and disarmament negotiations. What security is there  I ask  in a system under which mischance  malevolence or madness may entomb not only the nuclear Powers  but all of us?With the fate of the world in their hands  how can the two major nuclear Powers continue to refuse to respond promptly and positively to the overtures each has made to the other? The leaders of the United States of America and the Soviet Union  separately and together  have given indications that progress can be made. The tentative steps they have taken seem to shew that there is common ground. They agree on the need for deep cuts in nuclear weapons. Their proposals now lie on the negotiating table. They must not just lie there. The political will of the major Powers to end the arms race will be judged by what they do now to narrow the negotiating gap between them. An old adage says: ""Procrastination is the thief of time."" Time is fast running out. The nations of the world  all but a handful of them non-nuclear  cannot wait much longer; they have waited too long already.Nor can we  the small countries  simply conclude that it is a problem only for the nuclear Powers to solve. He must take a hand  together. New Zealand welcomes the successful conclusion earlier this week of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence-Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe. As earlier speakers from both East and West have noted  the agreement should make a significant contribution towards reducing tensions in Europe. That benefits not only Europe  but the wider international community. The agreement is most welcome after a long period of stalemate on arms control and disarmament negotiations. But it is only a beginning. We urge the larger Powers to get on with resolving their wider differences. Meanwhile there are things which the small can do  steps which we can take in co-operation with one another to encourage disarmament.Among practicable arms control measures  the most urgent is a comprehensive test-ban treaty; one that would ban all testing by all nations  in all environments and for all time. No other single step would do so much to slow the remorseless advance of nuclear-weapon production and experimentation  or to establish confidence in the will of the nuclear Powers to eliminate nuclear weapons from the world's arsenals. It would be a truly universal arms control measure.There may be more than one route to a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The ending of testing by any State  even temporarily  is a step forward and should be welcomed. A mutual moratorium by two or sore would be better still  even if a temporary one. All such steps give time for talk and delay disastrous escalation.There may be other provisional measures involving all the nuclear-weapon States which would help establish confidence and encourage a commitment to negotiate a permanent ban on testing. But none of these can be a substitute for a comprehensive test ban. The New Zealand Government will again join with others in calling on the Conference on Disarmament to start immediately with the work of drawing up a comprehensive test-ban treaty. New Zealand  too  is ready to take part in an international system for monitoring a test ban. We have some facilities in place for monitoring testing in our own region and are preparing to improve them.There is room for smaller powers to act in the regional sphere  too  in practical ways that the United Nations has recognized as valuable. For its part  New Zealand will not permit nuclear weapons in our country  even temporarily  as on visiting ships or aircraft. We intend to keep our land  our waters and our ports  and our air space nuclear-free.With the members of the South Pacific Forum  an annual gathering of 13 independent states  we have moved to establish a nuclear-free zone in the South Pacific. The Rarotonga Treaty was adopted over a year ago now. It prohibits the acquisition  stationing or testing of nuclear weapons by any of its parties. This year's forum at Suva adopted three Protocols to the Treaty. These call on the major nuclear Powers to respect the zone. I am glad to be able to tell you that some have already indicated their willingness to sign these Protocols. The New Zealand Government  along with others in the region  hopes they will soon be endorsed by all those countries eligible to sign. But  the South Pacific will not be free of the scourge of nuclear testing until France accepts that the security concerns of a distant European Government should not thwart the legitimate desire of the nations of the South Pacific to live in peace and safety in a nuclear-free environment. For too long  far too long  the Pacific has been used as a testing-ground by the nuclear Powers. Two of them stopped testing there long ago. It is time for France to follow their example. I would note also  in passing  that contrary to what has been said earlier in this debate  the report of the Scientific Mission that visited the French testing site at Mururoa Atoll in 1983 does not provide a basis for asserting that those tests ""are being carried out in unquestionably safe conditions "" (A/41/PV.8  p. 71). That report specifically refused to rule out the possibility of serious damage to the Atoll and its surrounding environment in the longer-term future.The South Pacific countries are increasingly confident of their place in the international community  certain of what binds them together  determined to preserve their cultures  committed to the principles of democracy and consensus and willing to work closely with those nations that genuinely pursue co-operation.The micro-States in the vast ocean region that I come from present unique development challenges. New Zealand makes a major contribution  and we welcome the assistance of other countries in the region's development. Such assistance  however  is only one contribution towards economic growth. Equally important are fair and equitable returns for the region's limited resources  the produce of its |	land  its slowly expanding manufacturing exports and  most important  its fish.All that calls for international co-operation.The United Nations was involved earlier this year in another major step forward in the development of the Pacific. On 28 May the Trusteeship Council recommended that the Trusteeship Agreement over the Federated States of Micronesia  the Marshall Islands  Palau and the Northern Marianas should be terminated. At itsmeeting at Suva  the South Pacific Forum welcomed that development. New Zealand was a party to the Forum's consensus. The peoples of those Territories have said what they want. That is decisive. The United Nations has discharged its responsibilities  and the process of decolonization is coming nearer to completion in the South Pacific.There is a lesson here for New Caledonia. Our experience of decolonization has shown us that the United Nations can help bring about peaceful evolution. The South Pacific Forum has always regarded New Caledonia as a neighbor that should take its place as an independent member of the South Pacific community. It is  by history as well as by unchangeable geography  an integral part of the region. Unless its stability is preserved  the stability of the whole region and all its member States will be seriously affected. Forum members are concerned that the Territory's move to independence should take place peacefully. That means by negotiation. France clearly has the power to bring about change peacefully. It is deeply disappointing to us and to our South Pacific neighbors  therefore  that in the approach recently outlined by the present French Government it seems that independence is no longer its goal for New Caledonia. I noted this morning the statement of the French Minister for Overseas Departments and Territories  reported in today's Herald Tribune. He said:""When Australia and New Zealand are advocating independence for New Caledonia  they are advocating independence for a territory that would be under Libyan control.""Such a claim is farcical. We are not supporting any faction of the independence movement in New Caledonia. We support true self-determination for all real New Caledonians. The South Pacific Forum leaders have made it clear that they want to maintain a dialog with all the parties to see if a more promising situation can be brought about. The Heads of Government of the countries members of the South  Pacific Forum decided last month to seek the re-inscription of New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. That move was strongly endorsed by the Heads of State or Government of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement at their meeting at Harare. My delegation  with other South Pacific com tries  welcomes that support. We look forward to a positive decision by the Assembly and to a constructive solution to New Caledonia's travail.We all know that economic stability and prosperity are a necessary condition for real security. The need for international action by the vulnerable is as pressing here as it is in any other field. New Zealand  like many developing countries that are reliant on commodity exports  depends for long-term economic growth on its ability to trade fairly in those areas in which it has a comparative advantage. Yet we are being prevented from doing so by the absurdities of a distorted world trading system. Agricultural trade has generally been excluded from the international trade rules and disciplines. It is the first area to be hit by new protectionist measures  especially non-tariff barriers; it is the main victim of domestic production subsidies which  in the large developed countries have reached a level that even they now recognize as unsustainable. But it is the rest of us  the efficient producers  who have to deal with the massive over-production dumped cm world markets and that brings down returns for everyone.The problems of agriculture are a time-bomb ticking away under the world trading system. An explosion would threaten not just the prosperity of individual countries but global economic and political stability. That is why New Zealand attaches great importance to progress in a particular United Nations forum  that of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The new round of negotiations recently launched at Punta del Este offers a vital opportunity for the international community to establish just and equitable rules for the conduct of agricultural trade. That will be the measure of the new round's success. It has to succeed. It will not succeed without pain  as New Zealand well knows. But if it fails  the credibility of the whole multilateral system will be thrown into question.There is a need for international action on Africa  too. New Zealanders have been deeply moved by the plight of the sub-Saharan people  who continue to be afflicted by drought and famine. New Zealanders continue to work alongside the Government in supporting churches and other organizations undertaking rehabilitation projects. In the week before the special session on the critical economic situation in Africa they contributed substantially yet again to an international appeal  in this case Sport Aid.The outcome of the special session was welcomed as a starting point for planning strategies for the future. The endeavors to work out practical measures to bring about an end to Africa's economic and developmental problems are encouraging. The co-operation and commitment with which the special session's deliberations were conducted must be sustained if its sound recommendations are to be put into effect.New Zealanders have also been shocked by events in southern Africa - the violence in South Africa's black townships  the South African Government's further repression of rights and freedoms  the attacks on defenseless targets in neighboring countries  carried out simply to give a political message  and South Africa's obstruction of Namibian independence. For a while  it looked as though the entirely reasonable approach adopted by the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group might be successful in bringing all parties in South Africa together to negotiate a new political dispensation. The South African Government's rejection of those efforts  signaled as it was by the contemporaneous and wanton bombing of neighboring capitals  is to be deplored. Negotiation is always the preferable way to bring about necessary and lasting changes acceptable to the majority. The chances of a negotiated end to South Africa's troubles now look slim indeed. Such as they are  they must be grasped  or a holocaust will surely follow.The common theme in each issue I have raised is the need for united action. And in each case it is clear that the United Nations can play a crucial part  provided it has the support of those - the overwhelming majority of its Members -who are small  whose individual power is slight. It is disturbing  therefore  to see a weakening - even a conscious undermining - of the commitment to multilateral action. It is long-standing political indifference or  in some cases  hostility  which is the cause of the United Nations financial crisis. The selective withholding of contributions - a practice in which one major contributor has recently joined another - cannot be condoned. Nor can the action of those who allow dues to fall into arrears. But we have all contributed to the current crisis. We have pretended to believe that political problems could be solved simply by calling for more financial resources  more studies  more staff. Well  we were wrong. Entirely new measures are necessary  at once more drastic and more constructive.The Secretary-General took prompt and decisive action earlier this year to avert the immediate cash crisis. His package of measures was designed to contain the crisis this year. This Assembly must look at the longer term. It must be resolute.For we are in no better shape financially now than we were in April. We must recognize this in looking at the proposals before us both for economies and for reform. By a positive approach we emphasize to those owing funds that  while we cannot accept their disregard of binding Charter obligations  we are prepared to help ourselves. We small States have the most to lose - so we must find a way forward.We in New Zealand welcome the report of the High Level Group. We strongly endorse its consensus findings. We commend them to the membership. We must go on to develop quickly an agreed approach to the reform of the program and budget process   We must begin to run this important Organization like any self-respecting business - in the interests  that is  of its shareholders  the Member States. In the process  all of us are going to have to accept some curtailment of our favorite programs. We accept that. Compromise from all will be required.Reform of our finances  management and administration is the first requirement  for it is the prerequisite to efficiency.More important in the end  though  is the way this Organization goes about fulfilling the objectives of its Charter. I found myself in complete agreement with some observations two days ago of the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands and I- cannot do better  in conclusion  than to refer to them. He said:""Differences in ideologies and cultures are a fact of life. But polarization and mutual recrimination are not their inevitable corollary."" (A/41/PV.9  p. 46)I would add that although they are a possible and  as things stand  all too likely corollary  they are the very things this Organization was founded to dispel and to avoid for the future. They can only lead to ever deepening mistrust and hostility. It is no use pretending we are not going to disagree and from time to time disagree bitterly. What we must do is face that reality and instead of papering over differences by what the Netherlands Minister rightly called ""the practice of false consensus""  we must seek in a real spirit of reconciliation  and friendship  to find constructive and hopefully permanent solutions to the great and serious questions that today threaten to divide much of the world into two hostile camps. We must not risk being seen by future generations as having spent our brief and precious time here preparing for war  rather than working for peace."
"104",5387,"OMN",41,1986," I should like to express  on behalf of the delegation of Oman and on my own behalf  our deep satisfaction at the election of Ambassador Choudhury of Bangladesh to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. The fact that he represents Bangladesh  a country from the continent to which we too belong and with which we have close and strong relations  increases our pleasure. We are confident that the valuable experience he brings to his task will be of great help in ensuring the success of the session. I wish also to congratulate his predecessor  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies of Spain  on the way in which he conducted the business of the fortieth session of the General Assembly  and  above all  the special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. The efforts being made by African countries to deal with their difficult economic situation deserve the attention and support of the international community.I reiterate on behalf of the Government of the Sultanate of Oman our gratitude and appreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his tireless efforts and the admirable manner with which he handles the work of the international Organization  especially bearing in mind the acute financial crisis faced by the Organization  which makes it imperative for Member States to honor their commitments to the Organization by paying their contributions to the budget as soon as possible.The large number of world leaders who attended the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations proved beyond doubt that the United Nations is indispensable to mankind as a forum for the solution of disputes by peaceful means. If anything mars the performance of the Organization in its attempt to bring about peace and security  it is the fact that its resolutions frequently remain unimplemented. Were those resolutions to be implemented  friendship and co-operation would prevail among all States  thus giving effect to the principles of the Organization  which in turn would bring to the peoples of the world well-being and stability.Thus  it is now more than ever necessary to redouble our efforts to ensure implementation of the resolutions of the Organization so that it may remain strong and play its pioneering role in the maintenance of international peace and security and in formulating permanent and just solutions for the many problems threatening international peace.Foremost among those problems is that of the Middle East  of which the question of Palestine is the core. The United Nations has a special responsibility in connection with this problem  for it has been on the agenda of the world Organization since its inception and has a negative effect on international peace and security. We reaffirm that any solution to this problem that fails to take into account the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to live in peace and security on its own land and Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories will be incomplete. There is no doubt that had it not been for the intransigence of Israel and its refusal to respond to any peace initiatives or to implement the resolutions of the United Nations  a just peace would now prevail in the Middle East  peace that would guarantee all the peoples of the region the right to live in security  friendship and peace.We believe that it is high time for the international community to play its proper part in persuading Israel to accept a just peace. The Middle East will not enjoy stability or security while Israel continues to ignore the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to occupy the Arab territories and continues to violate the sovereignty and security of neighboring States.In this respect the Sultanate of Oman believes that an international conference would provide the most acceptable forum for seeking a permanent  comprehensive solution of the whole problem and that all the parties concerned should participate on an equal footing in such a conference.The war that is raging between Iraq and Iran has now entered its seventh year and continues to deplete the energies and resources of two Moslem peoples. It recently experienced a serious escalation  at a time when the States members of the Gulf Co-operation Council were using their good offices  based on the resolution of the Muscat summit  to help bring that war to an end by peaceful means in a way that would guarantee the interests of both parties.We welcome the responsive position adopted by our brother Iraq towards peace initiatives and continue to hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will respond similarly to the initiatives taken to end that destructive war.The Sultanate of Oman  faithful to the principle of the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  supports all the efforts made by the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations to end this tragedy.In spite of the fact that there has been no progress in finding a way to bring both parties to the conflict to the negotiating table  we still believe that the United Nations is the most appropriate and acceptable forum for the conduct of a dialog between them on their conflict. We believe that the eight-point proposal submitted by the Secretary-General could represent an acceptable common ground for such a dialog  even though a direct dialog may not be possible during the first stages of the negotiations. However  it could take place initially through the Security Council  which bears the primary responsibility for international peace and security.Since January 1980  the General Assembly has adopted many resolutions on the situation in Afghanistan. Regrettably  those resolutions remain unimplemented because of the continued foreign presence on the territory of Moslem Afghanistan  in violation of the principle of respect for the sovereignty of States and non-interference in their internal affairs.In this respect  we should like to support the efforts made by the Secretary-General through his Special Representative  Mr. Cordovez  to bring about a solution of the Afghan problem. We hope that those efforts will lead to a solution to that problem that would guarantee that the people of Afghanistan can exercise its right to self-determination and that would ensure the right of the refugees to return to their homeland and to live in peaceful coexistence with neighboring peoples on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of others.There is another similar problem which requires the special attention of the international community  namely  the problem of the continued presence of Vietnamese forces in Democratic Kampuchea. Those foreign troops remain there in spite of the fact that the international community has called for their immediate withdrawal so as to enable the Kampuchean people to determine its destiny and choose its own system of government.In calling for the immediate withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces from Democratic Kampuchea  we are bound to express our support of and pay a tribute to the efforts made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to find a just solution to that problem. The latest of those efforts is represented by the eight-point plan which resulted from the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Association held in Indonesia in April 1986. This plan has met with the support of many countries throughout the world. We also support the plan presented by the Government of National Alliance under the chairmanship of Prince Norodom Sihanoukto find a just solution for this problem.Because of our friendship with so many of the African countries  the Sultanateof Oman shares with those States their legitimate aspirations  and denounces the policy of racial discrimination of the Government of South Africa  a policy that violates all ethics and principles of international human conduct. My country likewise condemns all the repressive practices of the Government of South Africa against the black majority. At the same time  we should like to associate ourselves with those who call for the immediate independence of Namibia through the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions  in particular Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which includes the United Nations plan for theindependence of Namibia.The Government of South Africa is called upon now to co-operate with neighboring African States in finding a formula that could put an end to the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination and bring about the independence of Namibia with a view to achieving the well-being of the African peoples in peace and stability.The Sultanate of Oman  in view of its geographical location and on its policy of keeping the Indian Ocean free from the rivalry of the great Powers and free from all forms of tension  has since 1971 supported the General Assembly Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.The Sultanate has also participated  as it still does  in the work of the Ad Hoc Conraittee on the Indian Ocean  which undertook preparatory work for the International Conference on the Indian Ocean which was originally scheduled to convene in 1981. we regret that so far that Conference has not been held. It has been postponed from one year to the next  and it is now scheduled to take place during the first half of 1988. We hope that the member countries of the Ad Hoc Conraittee will summon sufficient political resolve to complete the preparatory work; thereby assuring effective participation in the conference when it takes place. This is an important step that has to be taken in order to declare tne Indian Ocean a zone of peace.The situation in Central America is a source of concern because of the tension that prevails among the countries of the region. We are confident that the Central American countries fully realize that their national responsibilities dictate mutual respect for the rights of all peoples  for the sovereignty of States  and for their desire for economic stability and development  in this context  we should like to support the efforts made by the Contadora Group to settle the differences in the area. We believe that the efforts of the Contadora Group offer the best guarantee for achieving the peace and security desired by the States of the region.One of the main challenges faced by mankind at this time is the control of the arms race  particularly the nuclear-arms race  and arms reduction. This has been confirmed by the Final Document of the first special session on disarmament  which states: ""... effective measures of nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war have the highest priority. To this end  it is imperative to remove the threat of nuclear weapons  to halt and reverse the nuclear-arms race until the total elimination of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems has been achieved ...""My country supports all efforts to stop the arms race on earth as a necessary step towards a return to detente  and to the establishment of a comprehensive system of international security and co-operation as well as the implementation of development for all peoples.We hope in that respect that the detente that has started to take place in relations between the two super-Powers will b? reflected in their forthcoming summit meeting  so that the two countries may achieve results that will help the disarmament negotiations  and thus lessen international tension  and help find appropriate solutions to the crises that the international community faces today.The success of the efforts made at the fortieth session  manifested in the adoption of the resolution on terrorism  and the success of the special session on the critical economic situation in Africa  from 27 to 31 May this year  demonstrated that international will could solve the most complicated problems if guided in the right direction. We hope that the positive impression created by that success will lead to action being taken to correct the drift of the world economy  which can be achieved only by a constructive North-South dialog to establish a new international economic order that is more equitable to all States. That will not happen unless the industrialized and developed countries redouble their official development aid to the developing nations  reduce the burden of those nations' external indebtedness  eliminate discriminatory protective measures  help the transfer of advanced technology and stabilize the prices of those countries' main commodities at a fair level especially since the allegation by the industrialized and developed countries that the deterioration of the world economy was caused by the crisis high oil prices no longer has any validity.While the world faces economic recession  the developing countries which are hardest hit do not receive enough assistance from the affluent countries  particularly the industrialized nations. The economies of the oil-producing countries  which gave generous assistance in the past  now face difficulties because of falling oil prices on world markets  affecting the assistance they are able to extend to the developing countries.We believe that all of us should regard the difficult problems we are facing as an incentive to strengthen and promote the role of this international Organization so that we may enable it to find appropriate solutions. That will not be possible unless every Member State shoulders its responsibility  as stated by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman on 18 November 1982. He said:""It is time for every State to assume its responsibility within the framework of the international family with a view to promoting and reaffirming the role of the United Nations  making it more forcefully and positively effective for the sake of international peace and security."""
"105",5433,"PAK",41,1986,"Sir  allow me  once again  to offer ray felicitations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. Under your wise and able guidance  this forty-first session of the General Assembly will surely achieve important and far-reaching results.May I also take this occasion to pay a special tribute to Mr. Perez de Cuellar for his unceasing efforts to promote international peace and harmony and to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The lucid presentation in the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization reflects the awesome challenges  as also the unprecedented opportunities  facing the United Nations and its Member States. The Pakistan delegation expresses the hope that  at this critical juncture  the Secretary-General will continue at the helm of the world Organization.Even 41 years after the declaration of the purposes and principles which inspired the collective will of mankind to establish the United Nations to usher in an era of inter-State conduct governed by the rule of law  justice and equity  the world is still convulsed by strife and turmoil.The problems confronting mankind still remain acute  polarization between the East and the West persists; the nuclear race threatens the very survival of humanity; the gap between the rich and the poor has widened; and resort to the use of force and interference in the internal affairs of sovereign States have increased.In our neighborhood  the principles of the Charter have been most flagrantly violated by the military intervention in Afghanistan. For nearly seven years  undaunted by the presence of 120 000 Soviet troops  the Afghan people  true to their historic traditions and character  have waged a heroic national resistance against the might of a super-Power. They have proved indomitable in courage  steadfast in resolve and defiant in adversity. Inside Afghanistan a sinister design is being pursued through genocide and large-scale uprooting of the population. Such policies have served only to intensify the Afghan struggle. A million Afghans are estimated to have laid down their lives. Five million  a third of the country's population  have been obliged to seek shelter in Pakistan and Iran. The three million Afghans in Pakistan constitute the largest concentration of refugees anywhere in the world. We continue to provide them with basic sustenance as our Islamic and humanitarian duty. We are grateful to those friendly States and international agencies which have assisted us in discharging this humanitarian responsibility.Apart from this immense burden  the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan seriously threatens Pakistan's own security. There are almost daily violations of our border  which have caused serious loss of life and property. There has also been a sharp increase in acts of sabotage and subversion in our territory  accompanied by threats and pressures.Pakistan desires an early end to the conflict in Afghanistan  which does not admit of a military solution. We are committed to seeking a just and an equitable political settlement on the basis of the principles endorsed by the General Assembly. Pakistan has worked sincerely and constructively to evolve such a solution through the proximity talks in Geneva  under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General and his Personal Representative  to both of whom I wish to pay high tribute.The fate of a political settlement now depends on the acceptance of a time-frame for the early withdrawal of Soviet troops. That time-frame must be of short duration  to conform to the repeated demands of this Assembly for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan. Such a settlement would also be in conformity with the wishes of the Afghan people and would enable the Afghan refugees to return to their homes in safety and honor. The token withdrawal of six Soviet battalions is a welcome first step  but what is required is not a token disengagement but the total and early withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Afghanistan.Pakistan will continue to extend its fullest co-operation to the United Nations Secretary-General and his Personal Representative  Mr. Diego Cordovez  in the search for an equitable political solution of the situation in Afghanistan. The Geneva negotiations have readied a critical juncture. We hope this General Assembly will once again take a decision to reflect the wishes of the international community and the conscience of the world at large for the early termination of the foreign military intervention in Afghanistan  the restoration of that country's independent  sovereign and non-aligned status and the return of the Afghan refugees to their homes in safety and honor.The same principles govern our policy on the question of foreign Intervention in Kampuchea. Pakistan supports the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea under the leadership of Prince Norodon Sihanouk and its struggle for national independence. The imposition of a regime by force of foreign arras on the pretext of rectifying earlier violations of human rights in that country is totally unacceptable. We fully endorse the repeated calls of the General Assembly for the withdrawal of all foreign forces  thus enabling the Kampuchean people to choose their own system without coercion and outside interference.The tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq has injected another dangerous element into an area already embattled and inflamed. The war remains a cause for profound anguish and dismay. Not only has it consumed precious human and material resources of the two countries but it also threatens our region with incalculable consequences for international peace and security^ We have been unrelenting in our efforts to bring that conflict to a speedy end. In the forums of the United Nations  the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the Islamic Conference we have endeavored to explore all possibilities for a just and equitable settlement. We earnestly hope for an early cessation of hostilities and a settlement that reconciles the demands of justice with the imperatives of peace.The situation in southern Africa poses a serious threat to regional and international peace. The brazen attempts of the Pretoria regime to perpetuate the abhorrent system of apartheid  its savage and mounting repression of the majority of the South African people  its aggressive policies of intimidation and coercion  both military and economic  against the front-line States  are a challenge to the international conscience  an insult to mankind and a crime against humanity. There can be no peace  no stability  no security in southern Africa until this abhorrent system has been totally eradicated.Namibia's struggle for liberation from Pretoria's illegal colonial occupation is another front in southern Africa's relentless crusade for dignity and freedom. The heroic struggle of the South West African People's Organization (SWAFO)  the sole and authentic voice of the Namibian people  must be supported morally end materially by the international community. The recently concluded special session of the General Assembly has reaffirmed  the United Nations plan  as endorsed by Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  as the only basis for Namibia's independence. It cannot be linked to any extraneous issue  such as the presence of Cuban troops in Angola. The members of the Western Contact Group carry a clear responsibility for ensuring the early implementation of the United Nations plan.In particular  we hope that all the permanent members of the Security Council will support the call for effective sanctions against South Africa. The argument that sanctions will hurt the majority population of South Africa and the front-line African States lacks validity  since the African population has declared its readiness to accept any hardship in preference to racist oppression.The Middle East continues - be a source of grave danger to regional and world peace. Israel has repeatedly frustrated all peace initiatives. Its obduracy can only escalate violence and lead to another conflict  with grave consequences for world peace. Pakistan deplores Israel's intransigence  as also its policy of annexation of the occupied Arab territories and the establishment of Jewish settlements on usurped land  we are appalled by the repeated desecration of the Holy Places under Israel's occupation  especially the violation of the sanctity of the Holy Al Aqsa Mosque  one of Islam's best sacred shrines.Pakistan supports the convening of an international conference to evolve a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East  with the participation of all the par tip = concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. A just and comprehensive settlement must contain two fundamental elements: first  Israel's total withdrawal from all the occupied territories  including Holy Jerusalem  and  secondly  the fulfillment of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and nationhood in their homeland.At present world peace and humanity's survival are balanced on the razor's edge of nuclear deterrence. The survival of human civilization depends on our ability to achieve general and complete disarmament.The world was heartened when the two super-Powers agreed  in 1985  to negotiate the reduction of their nuclear arsenals and to prevent their ^reading to outer space. The agreement in Geneva between the leaders of the two countries that ""a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought"" (A/40/1070  p. 3) is cause for hope that the use of nuclear weapons can ultimately be prohibited. He are pleased to see the positive outcome of the Stockholm Conference cm Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe.It is equally essential to pursue multilateral disarmament negotiations. We hope that negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty will commence without further delay at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. Meanwhile  a moratorium should be observed on nuclear testing  as called for by the recent submit meeting of members of the Non-Aligned Movement. The Conference on Disarmament must also conclude as soon as possible a convention prohibiting chemical weapons  reinforce the existing restraints on an arms race in outer space  evolve agreed security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and endeavor to finalize a comprehensive program for disarmament.The tragic incident at Chernobyl has highlighted the grave danger inherent in damage to or destruction of nuclear facilities by accident or by design. It is important to reach international agreements on nuclear safety and on the norms of proscribing attacks against nuclear facilities. The Chernobyl incident has also underlined the need for a rational and equitable regime for co-operation in this field  we hope that the forthcoming Conference for the Promotion of International Co-operation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy will address itself to this issue  keeping in mind the particular needs of the developing countries  which face an acute shortage of conventional fuels and energy resources. The industrialized countries have a responsibility to assist the developing countries in the proper maintenance of the reactors they export and to refrain from prohibition of the supply of vital spare parts. Pakistan is committed to the goal of nuclear non-proliferation. In order to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in our region  Pakistan proposed in 1974  immediately after a nuclear explosion was conducted by India  the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia. Since then  we have offered a number of other proposals to promote denuclearization in South Asia. We have repeatedly enumerated those proposals  which include simultaneous accession by India and Pakistan to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of t&iclear weapons.Pakistan desires to promote mutual confidence and beneficial co-operation in South Asia. We have joined six other countries of the region to establish the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC). SAARC offers hope for the acceleration of the development process and the promise of peace and progress to the 1 billion people of South Asia.Pakistan has continued its endeavors to foster good-neighborly relations with India. The understanding reached last December between the leaders of Pakistan and India not to attack each other's nuclear facilities was a welcome development in this context. We believe that  with mutual goodwill  a bilateral treaty an the non-use of force could also be speedily concluded. This process  we hope  will also lead to the achievement of a peaceful settlement of the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir  on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and in the spirit of the Simla Agreement.Today  international peace and security are threatened not only by wars and disputes but also by poverty and deprivation. Living standards in many poor nations are declining  spreading hunger  disease and death. The economic gap between developed and developing countries is widening. The recent volatile shifts in economic trends confirm the structural imbalance in the world economy. Unless this is corrected  we may witness a global economic decline without precedent  spreading suffering aid chaos and severely straining international order and stability.An immediate revival of North-South dialog is essential for orderly growth of the world economy. So far  the enormous problems created by the indebtedness of the developing countries have not been addressed in a comprehensive and integrated manner. The recent agreement on the launching of a new round of trade negotiations is a welcome development. It signals a standstill on protectionism and the initiation of the process of dismantling trade barriers imposed unjustly and indiscriminately against developing countries. It also demonstrates the flexibility and political will necessary for solving complex problems of the world economy.We hope that a more flexible and global approach  which seeks to resolve the debt cr is is through economic growth  will be possible in the context of a renewed dialog between the developed and developing countries and in particular through the holding of the international conference on money  finance and trade for development. In the meantime  it is necessary substantially to increase financial flows to the developing countries.Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms. The perpetration of acts of terrorism against the innocent can have no justification whatsoever and must merit the severest punishment. We have accepted all international measures to counter this scourge  including the three conventions relating to aerial hijacking. We share the view that special measures  including security measures  should be adopted to counter terrorism.The curse of narcotics is becoming a global problem with grave portents for the well-being of peoples everywhere. It is a problem that transcends all national boundaries. The Government of Pakistan is committed to the eradication of drug abuse  not only within our own country  but indeed everywhere in the world. It is our earnest hope that the first global conference  to be held next year  to deal with all aspects of drug abuse and illicit trafficking will initiate and adopt measures which the international community could apply collectively to eliminate this evil.It is ironic that so soon after our leaders renewed their dedication to the United Nations at its fortieth anniversary  and at a moment when global recognition of its achievements is growing  the world Organization has been plunged into the most serious financial crisis in its history. We shall give serious consideration to the report of the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to examine the corrective measures the situation demands. It must be emphasized  however  that the payment of assessed contributions to the United Nations is an obligation under the Charter and must be met faithfully. This difficulty could perhaps have been averted if the persistent practice by some States of withholding part of their contributions  especially for the United Nations peace-keeping operations  had not been tolerated in the past. Pakistan will work constructively to promote a long-term solution to this financial crisis.If human civilization is to survive  the States represented here must strengthen  not erode  the concept of international partnership for peace and progress to which they have pledged themselves under the United Nations Charter. In this age of nuclear weapons  the security of each individual State is the concern of all. At a time when the exploration of mankind's common heritage of space and oceans holds out such vast promise of progress and well-being  global partnership has become an imperative instead of an option. Such partnership  and the broad international co-operation which it entails  can be nurtured and promoted only within the United Nations. At this session  Meirber States must display the political will to transform the present crisis into a renewed and genuine commitment to this world Organization and to the hopes and aspirations of humanity which it embodies."
"106",5476,"PAN",41,1986,"Mr. President  in choosing you to preside over the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly  this Organization took a very wise decision  on which we should all congratulate ourselves; for we shall be able to draw on the extensive resources of your political skill and diplomatic experience and on the guiding presence of someone deeply interested in and committed to the fate of the international community.Panama extends a warm welcome to the peoples and Governments represented here and hopes that in the not too distant future we shall be joined by the remaining nations of the world as full-fledged Members  so that one of the main purposes of this Organization can be fulfilled.I am pleased to express the heartfelt gratitude of Panama for the dedication and perseverance of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and for the wisdom  vision  skill and tact which have characterized his constant efforts to restore peace wherever it has been shattered or threatened and to preserve it where  fortunately  it prevails. The recent advances in the cause of peace arelargely the result of his extraordinary dedication  and the praise and thanks which will be extended to him at this session will be well deserved.In particular  in so far as Panama is concerned  we are grateful for the exceptional promptness  the receptive attitude and the painstaking attention with which he has listened to us in regard both to problems of Panama specifically and to those relating to our peace efforts through the Contadora Group.My Government's foreign policy is based on a tradition of struggle against colonialism and discrimination in all its forms and manifestations; against the use of force as an instrument of submission or subjugation; against intervention in the internal affairs of States and for the defense of the principle of equality among peoples; for inherent respect for human rights; for the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes; for the equitable distribution of the benefits of mankind's scientific  technical and cultural progress; but  above all  for the right of States to have their territorial integrity respected and the right of all peoples to enjoy political independence and to forge their own destinies  without interference of any kind - especially foreign pressures.For those fundamental reasons  I wish to place it on record in this Assembly that Panama rejects and condemns the violent armed invasion of Afghanistan and supports the demands of the Afghan people that Soviet armed forces be withdrawn from their territory. It also repudiates the state of permanent  aggression suffered by the front-line countries and the situation of the Namibian people  for they constitute flagrant violations of international law which deserve the unanimous condemnation of other nations and threaten the ideals which inspired the creation of this Organization. Furthermore  they force us to see with threatening clarity that our efforts will be useless  in the face of the arrogance of the racist minority  if we impose only moral sanctions. I should also like to express Panama's regret at the obstinacy with which the Pretoria Government still clings to mankind's most shameful practices. The majority wishes of the South African people have long since shown that apartheid as a formula for human coexistence has had its day. Unfortunately  obscurantism and intolerance continue to prevail over the tireless efforts of the civilized world  which is filled with horror and consternation at the crimes committed daily in that territory.At the very heart of our most hard-won struggles is our respect for the principle of equality among all men  and we therefore wish to see established in South Africa as soon as possible an egalitarian system reflecting the wishes of the majority of that people and a democratically elected government that will fully rectify the odious practices we insistently deplore and condemn.Furthermore  and on the basis of the same considerations  Panama supports Madagascar in its claim to the Malagasy Islands; the Comoros in their authentic right to incorporate the Island of Mayotte under their jurisdiction; Bolivia in its long-standing aspiration to gain access to the sea and thereby contribute to its development; Spain in achieving a negotiated settlement to the problem of Gibraltar and Cyprus in its well-justified desire to win universal recognition for its independence and freedom. Panama also advocates the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea and the holding of free elections in that country under strict international supervision.In a great spirit of conciliation  Panama will support any effort to put an end to the tensions and acts of violence between Arabs and Israelis. The State of Israel was created by a resolution of this Organization  and Panama strongly supports that decision  that country's existence and its participation in the community of nations. It also supports any effort to secure an end to the prolonged state of war between Iran and Iraq and demands from their Governments absolute respect for vessels flying the Panamanian flag  some of which have been the victims of unjustified attack in open violation of international agreements. Panama supports any attempt to secure the conclusion of agreements to put an end to the fratricidal struggle of the Lebanese people and any action to ensure the peaceful unification of the Korean people  which must be achieved through direct dialog between the two parties. We hope that that will take place soon and that the Republic of Korea and the People's Democratic Republic of Korea will become fullmembers of the United Nations  so that the two parts of the Korean peninsula are represented in the Organization.Similarly  Panama welcomes any efforts to secure the holding of negotiations between the Government of the Republic of Argentina and the Government of Her Brittanic Majesty with a view to eliminating all vestiges of colonialism from the Malvinas Islands.Furthermore  the destructive capacity of the nuclear weapons deployed or stockpiled by the super-Powers is such that a mere mention of their equivalent in dynamite per human being is a telling indication of the absurd course mankind has thus far pursued.The Heads of State or Government of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and Tanzania  in offering their assistance in securing agreements among the nuclear weapon countries  have taken an initiative which all peoples of the world have welcomed. Their declarations and the conclusions they reached last month in Mexico are a faithful reflection of our position and our hopes.In recent months we have followed with the closest attention and the keenest interest the public statements and proposals made by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America  because those statements rekindle the hope that those countries will make definite progress towards reaching fundamental agreements that will dispel the threat of a nuclear holocaust which has hung over us for the past four decades.There can be no doubt that any concrete step towards the prohibition of nuclear weapons and their stockpiling  and any measure to prevent the arms race from extending and becoming widespread on earth  would be cause for universal rejoicing. We can never allow the day to come when a human being will raise his eyes to heaven  searching for a reply to the eternal questions  only to see the terrible silhouette of his imminent destruction.I wish to place on record our position concerning two terrible evils of our day that warrant the most stringent action and the most constant vigilance on the part of all Governments: terrorism and drugs.The Organization must strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms and wherever its appalling ramifications have spread  for no human conscience can condone the sacrifice of innocent lives for the sake of alleged tactics of militancy or persuasion  no matter who the authors of such unpardonable crimes may be or who instigated or encouraged their perpetration.The same attitude must also be taken to the problem of the trafficking in and use of narcotic drugs  the proliferation of which has reached appalling levels in many countries. We have an immediate obligation to root out this infamous tumor from our contemporary human society  for it corrupts and erodes the most elementary principles of conduct assumed to be indispensable to the life of peoples.Faced with this permanent attack on the very essence of mankind's best aspirations and the fruits of his social and cultural progress  we must act in unison  indefatigably and conscientiously  to put an end to the production and distribution of narcotic drugs and to combat their traffic. To that end  we must apply the same degree of vigilance  the same interest and the same zeal  both internationally and locally  without ever falling into the futile trap of singling out and condemning the corruption in our neighbor's camp while closing our eyes to what is going on in our own back yard.The drug problem must strengthen the unity of men and hence the unity of nations  for when we all understand that the value of human life transcends any other consideration  we will be able to set up a common front that will save mankind from this scourge.We acknowledge and applaud the efforts of other States to this end. Panama has not been spared this plague and  as a contribution to the common cause  ourcountry will in the next few days be issuing a new legal instrument which  approaching the drug problem as an international problem  will permit total co-operation among States in suppressing drug offenses  allow for the confiscation of goods on a reciprocal basis among nations  speed up the extradition procedures for persons detained in such cases and penalize such offenses with stiffer penalties in order to deal with this latest calamity looming over our younger generation.For those Governments currently grappling with the dilemma of meeting their countries' international financial commitments  it is appalling to make a comparison between the amount of the external debt of the least-advantaged countries and the volume of the military budgets of the major Powers.On the one hand  we feel the aspirations of our peoples to live in greater dignity and  on the other  we see quite simply the ever-growing capacity for death and destruction. On one side  we see vast sectors of mankind living in the most dire poverty and  on the other  we see the appalling and ever-more sophisticated machinery of death and destruction being constantly refined.Although the developing countries welcome the possibility of agreements by the powerful nations in the areas of the economy and peace  they resent the way in which the limited possibilities for the progress and well-being of the weak are overlooked. This equation prompts Panama to support all efforts which contribute to the strengthening of peace and security  especially at the regional level  whileat the same time urging that part of the resources available be used preferably forprograms of economic development and social progress  which are urgently needed.The first concern I wish to mention in turning to the current problems of the world economy is the stifling situation which foreign debt obligations have created in the developing countries  a situation which prevents them from meeting social needs and ensuring adequate economic growth. This situation must make creditor countries  which have a great interest in the preservation of peace  freedom and  above all  democracy  realize that poverty and backwardness hold the seeds of social unrest  which pushes peoples to agitation and violence in the search for other political solutions which seem likely to improve their precarious living conditions.The innumerable complex problems which characterize the interdependence of economies in our time have made anxiety and unrest or the breakdown of the social order and recourse to armed violence in some regions obvious dangers for the rest of the world.Inequalities in the flow of capital and technical know-how continue to make a satisfactory level of progress and development a privilege reserved for a handful of peoples. The misfortune of the underprivileged  swept by a tide of justified but unsatisfied aspirations  threatens the future of peace and freedom in all nations. The sooner the Governments of the countries where wealth and power havebeen concentrated understand and accept this reality  the sooner mankind will find itself on the road to universal respect for the ideals of peace and freedom.In order to create the necessary conditions for the sustained growth of the world economy  we must analyze in depth and conscientiously reorder the economic relations among States so that there is genuine equity in trade and in the study of the factors which determine the distribution of capital investment.The solutions adopted to deal with the debt crisis continue to favor creditor countries  to the detriment of the development and political stability of debtor countries. Panama is determined to meet its credit responsibilities but wishes to give the international financial community warning that it must not seek to place any country in the position of having to choose between satisfying the basic needs of its people and canceling its obligations on the pretext of avoiding a world financial catastrophe.In the face of these dilemmas  the Governments of all countries  creditors and debtors alike  and all the international credit institutions and agencies concerned have an unavoidable responsibility to offer creative solutions which will enable us to overcome the crisis without destroying the future.Aware of its responsibility as a nation and of its history as a host country  Panama once again offers its territory for a summit meeting of all the countries and bodies concerned  so that in a realistic  creative and constructive dialog a successful and effective solution may be found to avert the impending fatal outcome.In recognizing the efforts made by the United Nations in its consistent aim of safeguarding peace and in its numerous activities aimed at promoting the material and spiritual progress of mankind  I must express the gratitude of the Panamanian people for the specific actions and positive influence of the Organization on behalf of the ideals we Panamanians pursue and the struggles we wage.We cannot forget the support given to the proposal by the Panamanian Ambassador  Aquilino Boyd  that the Security Council in Panama at a crucial stage in our efforts to secure the abrogation of the shameful 1903 Panama Canal Treaty. Subsequently  with the election of former President Illueca as President of the General Assembly at the thirty-eighth session  the Organization honored Panama in a way that we shall never forget.Concerning the crisis in Central America  the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation  which was handed to the five Central American Foreign Ministers on 7 June last  reproduced the results of three and a half years of talks and negotiations with the countries directly concerned  which established formulas for agreement which had been carefully studied  discussed and revised and which left unresolved only a few differences concerning international military maneuvers andthe control and reduction of weapons.Analysis of that instrument  which contains a whole set of understandings reached with the participation of all the Central American countries in the face of many problems and difficulties  must logically be followed by the political decision of those countries to resolve whatever has remained pending so that  with vision and realism  they can proceed with the signing of the peace document.The mediation of the Contadora Group and the Support Group succeeded in overcoming major differences and deep-rooted distrust and resentment and in reconciling markedly different positions and aspirations  a task of conciliation which brought us very near to achieving peace.Throughout all this time  the spirit and action of Contadora contained the scope of the hostilities and prevented the outbreak of widespread war. From the outset of its efforts the Contadora Group has insisted and emphasized that agreement on the necessary conditions for peace and their acceptance andobservance depend principally on the political will of the Central American countries  but also on the political consent of countries with important links and interests in the region.Panama  together with the other countries of Contadora  is determined to continue to fight for the Latin American approach - that of the peaceful settlement of disputes in Latin America. Our unswerving aim of continuing to seek the conclusion of an international instrument which may once and for all restore peace to the Central American region will not be altered by any kind of pressure.The Republic of Panama wishes to state to this Assembly that retrograde sectors wielding great economic power and considerable influence have conspired to weave a whole tissue of lies and slander against the image of the Governments of the countries that form the Contadora Group and have stopped at nothing in their perfidious attempt to undermine the process towards a peaceful settlement and frustrate our people's aspirations to peace.In this important forum  I denounce those same forces for launching a cruel campaign against my country because they are seeking to deny us the right to manage  operate and defend the Panama Canal from the date agreed in the Torrijos-Carter Treaties and to maintain the Panama Canal within the strictest neutrality  offering efficient service to all the nations of the world.Allow me now to refer to a serious question which concerns all the Governments that are represented here and that are concerned with safeguarding the principles of the Charter of the Organization and preserving the full force of tUeinternational legal order.In September 1977  the international community welcomed the culmination of years of effort on the part of Panama in the signing of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. With a high sense of justice  the great North American Power and Panama  a young and small country  offered the world  through those Treaties  an admirable example of what can be achieved when countries have the will to resolve old disputes and found differences peacefully.Imbued with the determination to make common interests prevail over divisive self-interest  the two countries agreed on a system for the management  operation and defense of the Canal until 31 December 1999  with the transfer to the Republic of Panama  on that date  of the inter-oceanic waterway  without encumbrances of any kind and in good operating order.On 27 September 1979  however  four days before those Treaties entered into force  the United States Congress adopted Public Law 96-70  in which it determined the conduct to be followed by the Panama Canal Commission in connection with the treaty signed with the Republic of Panama  thereby limiting rights inherent in agenuine joint administration.As a result of that action  which amounts to subjecting the norms of international law to the judgment of one of the parties in order to impose its wishes  my Government made an immediate protest  which was followed by numerous representations made by Panama at the bilateral level in order to put an end to this situation.By ignoring the scope and formality of the documents marking an agreement between the two countries  the United States Congress unilaterally set up a regime which still exists  by which the United States decides everything while its Panamian counterpart is limited to expressing its disagreement and protest at the refusal to recognize the rights of our Republic.The Canal Commission thus took over the direction of all matters relating to the Canal  and since then  some policies and practices have been applied unilaterally which contradict the spirit of the agreements reached between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Panamanian members of the Canal Commission have repeatedly denounced all those actions that we consider to be in violation of the Treaties. As the result of our insistence  we have managed to have a very small number of those violations removed. Certain major violations  however  have not even been considered.The inappropriate accounting practices adopted by the Canal Commission have resulted in a loss to the Republic of Panama of sums to which it was legitimately entitled in accordance with Article 13  paragraph 4 C of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty and which  however insignificant they might appear in the context of a United States budget  represent a considerable input to my country's financial requirements for meeting its population's most urgent needs.Furthermore  funds disbursed by the Canal Commission to cover obligations of the United States Treasury are also unilaterally charged  as costs for operating the Canal  thus removing profits that could have been used to finance urgent improvements without which the Canal will not be able later to meet the growing demands of international maritime traffic.The labor policies that have been adopted  also without our consent  bar Panamanians from access to senior technical and administrative posts  provided for by the principle of increasing participation  which is essential in order for thetransition to take place on 31 December 1999 without problems or complications of any kind.For these reasons  my Government has undertaken with renewed resolve and full determination to ensure that Public Law 96-70 of the United States Congress be abrogated or substantially revised  so that it does not violate the agreements reached in 1977 with the best of intentions.We feel that the signing of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties should have put an end to our country's great struggle. The adoption of Law 96-70  however  has confronted us with a new struggle  which we Panamanians must today wage for the benefit of future generations.Panama will continue to comply faithfully with the obligations imposed on it as a partner in the Canal and will continue to do so in a spirit of full co-operation and good faith  secure in the knowledge that the sense of justice of those who forged the great democracy of the United States will also apply to the people living on the banks of the Canal.In response to the profound desire for peace which distinguishes the Panamanian people  I should like to take this opportunity to urge the Governments represented here which have not yet signed the protocol to the treaty on the neutrality of the Canal to consider the advisability of doing so without further delay - a step that would be a source of great satisfaction to us.The developing nations - and above all those in which the majority of the population is still living in terrible conditions of hunger and misery - are the real Achilles' heel of the human condition  and man will not be able to live without the threat of war as long as vast and shameful differences exist among countries.Those with the highest qualifications and the greatest wealth are the ones who can contribute the most to lessening the heavy burden of unsatisfied aspirationsand correcting the tremendous inequalities which hang like the sword of Damocles over the whole of mankind.It is essential that all the nations of the world - large and small  rich and poor - and the peoples in them should commit themselves fully to the noble cause of pooling their efforts and potential with a view to finding positive solutions to the serious problems created by inadequate development. Extreme need pushes people beyond the limits of civilized conduct and turns man into his own enemy.It must be recognized that the United Nations  whose founding over 40 years ago filled the world with such hope and whose lofty aim it was to serve as the highest forum in which countries could settle their disputes through international dialog in its noblest expression  has seen the effectiveness of its aims weakened.This last and greatest bastion for the preservation of world peace cannot afford to lose the importance  respect and vitality necessary for it to fulfill its noble mission. To that end  however  it must renew the energy and strength with which it started and receive the firm support of all Member States which  as such  have committed themselves to the principles of peace established in the Charter.That support must not  however  be limited to theoretical adherence to just principles which are then violated with impunity. It must  rather  be transformed into an irreducible standard of conduct in the face of any conflict which threatens world peace and the sacred right to life of all peoples. Panama has been and always will be an eminently peace-loving country. Because of the very special nature of the geographical formation of the territory and what man's creative genius has made of it  we Panamanians have long understood the noble goals of serving the world.The Latin American nations have achieved through their struggles for independence the right to live in freedom and steer their own destinies  with appropriate respect for the rights of others. Peace  which the illustrious Mexican Benito Juarez defined as being based on respect for the rights of others  is the banner of this Organization-  it is the peace which Panama  as a free  sovereign andindependent country  preserves and defends.In Panama's democracy  which has been strengthened by its historic tradition and which today we all wish to renew and strengthen  we have the necessary conditions for strengthening relations of peace  freedom and respect with all thenations of the world.May peace triumph over war-  may freedom conquer slavery  may democracy prevailover totalitarianism; may justice overcome iniquity; may development defeat backwardness; may civilization prevail over obscurantism; and may man  as a citizen of the world  emerge from the vortex of time and circumstances in the image and likeness of the Divine Creator."
"107",5523,"PER",41,1986," In extending to you  sir  the greetings of the Government and people of Peru  I have to say how pleased we are that a representative of the third world is presiding over this session of the General Assembly  at a time when the international atmosphere is rife with signs of regression. I am convinced that  imbued with the valiant tradition of autonomy to which Bangladesh has been faithful since its dramatic attainment of independence  you will be able to guide the deliberations of this forum in the best and most just way.I should also like to express my country's appreciation of the firm yet gentle guidance given to this Assembly during its historic fortieth session by the experienced Spanish diplomat  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies.I do not believe that the fact of being a compatriot and  more than a colleague  a disciple  of our Secretary-General should inhibit me from associating Peru with the warm tributes paid to him by all the Members of the United Nations for his far-reaching  sustained efforts on behalf of international peace  security and development. For five years now a good part of our common hopes have been reposed in him and he has discharged that enormous responsibility not only with wisdom and intelligence but also with noteworthy distinction  in circumstances that have frequently been adverse.From the balance sheet of statements made by some hundred Heads of State on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations at the last General Assembly  a shared vision of disturbing trends at the international level emerges. On that occasion President Alan Garcia of Peru speaking from this same rostrum  drew the international community's attention to the existence of problems of exceptional seriousness  such as the foreign debt  the arms race  drugs trafficking and terrorism  which threaten the survival of states and undermine the very basis of world coexistence  and which are certainly a reflection of the present unjust international order  of the deterioration of the system of multilateral co-operation and its growing replacement by power politics.The year gone by reveals the worsening of such problems  and the consequent need to insist that they be dealt with and to issue a call for action. Peru sees a new turn of events in which confrontation between the blocs of world power has ceased to be exclusively strategic and military  but increasingly technological in nature and directly and more deeply related to the economic system of world domination.The big nations  because of the demands of that confrontation  encourage expenditures and large deficits in their own economies  which  in the last analysis  need to be financed by any means possible  thus increasing the cost of money and making the economic system that they control function as a giant suction mechanism.In this new model of domination  based on an unproductive creditor mentality through rates of interest  the way in which loans are allocated and the predominance of a national currency as the basis of international liquidity are at the root of the burgeoning debt and of the absurd situation in which the developing world is financing the struggle between the big Powers for international power at the cost of the poverty of our peoples.NS/at	A/41/PV.517(Mr. Wagner Tizon  Peru)Given this situation  the Peruvian Government took a historic decision  the validity of which has asserted itself increasingly on the international field  where no one doubts that it is not right to satisfy transnational capital with the sacrifice of our peoples and that it is irrational to enter into new loans only to pay prior interest and debts.The Peruvian Government has established the principle that  as we are paid for our exports and labour  thus shall we pay our debt without sacrificing the development and basic needs of our people  and in a measure of sovereign reaffirmation we set a ceiling of 10 per cent of our export income for debt-servicing. Thus we have been able to implement an independent and national economic policy which has made it possible for us to avoid a decline in the value of our currency  to reduce inflation  to lower interest rates  to reactivate the economy and employment  and to stimulate social expenditure by the State.This decision has been answered by the International Monetary Fund  which declared Peru ineligible for new credits from that institution. The fact that the Monetary Fund continues to use anachronistic criteria to apply that measure is a demonstration of its persistence in ignoring the seriousness of the problem of the foreign debt.On the other hand  the international community  fully aware of the explosive political nature of the problem  has chosen to inscribe the question of the foreign debt crisis and development on the agenda of the General Assembly  thus recognizing the competence of the United Nations to seek a just  effective and lasting solution.The debt today characterizes the historic stage when the transnational creditors and seeking to lead our countries towards extreme dependence  preventing them not only from defining the priorities of their development processes  but also from drawing up their own political plans.The foreign debt is therefore a retrograde step in the evolution of international relations because it tends to neutralize the State in its very essence.This situation obliges us to make a profoundly political assessment of the duty of the United Nations to oversee the future of the international community and to stem a trend which is so anarchic as to be a destructive element in the very system of international relations.The warning that the President of Peru sounded a year ago on the dangerous threat that drugs trafficking poses to contemporary civilization and the primary responsibility of the consumer countries was welcomed and confirmed by leaders the world over  and has become a central subject of national debate and a central subject in the political life of world consumer centers. Convinced that in order to confront this scourge  joint action is necessary Peru has entered into bilateral agreements with neighboring countries and at the Andean level we have promoted and signed the Rodrigo Lara Bonilia Convention  which bears the name of the Colombian minister  martyr in the struggle against drugs trafficking and which is open to accession by other Latin American countries.Furthermore  my country carried out the so-called Candor Operations  which struck a harsh blow at drugs traffickers by destroying sophisticated clandestine laboratories  landing strips  and by capturing planes and boats as well as modern weaponry in order to fulfill the commitment assumed by my country towards the youth of the world.With the moral authority conferred upon us by these actions  we urge the adoption of effective measures in the great consumer centers  as demand in those centers is primarily responsible for the existence of the narcotics traffic in accordance with the old economic law that demand creates its own supply.In disarmament debates we can see that in this nuclear era our civilization  for the first time in history  is coexisting with the means of its own destruction.This threat is more imminent today for two reasons. First  because the balance of terror  always precarious but thus far a real balance  is being bypassed in the strategic concepts of the super-Powers  while delays  in their arms-control talks have become disconcertingly long.Secondly  because the planned leap towards the militarization of outer space would not only exponentially expand the nuclear threat and its cost  but in certain sectors is being adduced as an anti-nuclear panacea.This bring us into an extraordinarily unstable international situation in which disarmament efforts may be frozen altogether  and in which the process of conventional and regional disarmament is also held back.Peru is not a nuclear country  nor does it wish to become one. Fortunately  Latin America has with great foresight chosen the path of denuclearization. This is why we firmly ask that the super-Powers do their duty towards mankind's future by halting the arms race and dismantling their nuclear arsenals.This is what mankind wants. This was the appeal made from Harare by the 101 Heads of state of the Non-illigned Movement. This is the demand of the international community represented in this Assembly  which cannot abandon its right and duty to protect life.When President Alan Garcia took the initiative in July last year in sponsoring a regional agreement to limit the procurement of arms  which has already received valuable support from neighboring countries  and when he announced then  as he also announced two months ago  a unilateral reduction of arms purchases  he was doing no more than to translate into reality in the context of Latin America that which we are seeking from the nuclear Powers - the right to life and development* We want to give a new dimension to defense needs on the basis of new concepts of regional security  based on a system of relations characterized by the dynamics of co-operation and not of conflict  thereby providing what is needed for the well-being of our people.That is why Peru also offered to be headquarters of the United Nations Regional center for Peace  Disarmament and Development  which can foster in Latin America a collective regional awareness of those objectives  which are of universal interest.Terrorism is today another irrational phenomenon  which the international community must tackle with resolve. Our primary obligation must be to reach  within the framework of the United Nations  legally binding agreements clearly dissociating States from terrorist activities  whether overt or covert  and effectively punishing those who promote terrorism. Unless that first goal is achieved  the political objective of the systematic blackmail and destabilization pursued by international terrorism will be promoted whether through contributing to the erosion of democratic societies and their replacement by repressive police States or through the collapse of the international legal order as people take the law into their own hands.In Peru  which has for some years suffered from the criminal action of terrorism as a misguided tool used to advance alleged social demands  our policy is clear: energetically to combat that armed fanaticism  but within the framework of law and respect for human rights  and if human rights are violated to punish in an exemplary manner those responsible  in such a way as to maintain intact our democratic order.Therefore  it has always been disappointing that some democratic States represented here permit - in a mistaken interpretation of freedom of opinion -expressions of support  however insignificant  for those that have chosen the path of fratricidal violence in a democracy as bread and pluralist as Peru's. This grave legal and moral distortion must be corrected. We urge democratic countries to rectify their legislation  and we urge the international community to adopt clear norms repudiating those absurdly lenient attitudes towards crime and destruction.I referred to those grave problems because I sincerely believe that they all have alarmingly destructive consequences which no State can confront alone  and because they really amount to a global crisis in international relations resulting in a weakening of the system of multilateral co-operation  a resurgence of power politics  the erosion of the international legal order  a recrudescence of local conflicts and a sharpening of the crisis in North-South relations.In this context it is clear that the so-called crisis of multilateralism is much more than a crisis of one form of international co-operation. What is at stake is the very validity of the system of co-operation and collective security  the alternative being to have to accept the legitimization of power as an instrument of international politics.That is why  in the specific context of the United Nations  any reform must strengthen the first of those two options - that is  the Organization's role as the body responsible for promoting peace  security  co-operation and the solution of the problems of development in a framework of responsibility and collective action. In that regard  any reform to improve the efficiency of the United Nations and to make more democratic the taking of decisions can only be welcomed by the international community. But if the Organization's distressing financial problems led us into situations that were incompatible with making the system more democratic  we should have no hesitation in choosing a more democratic and independent  but at the same time more austere  system giving no State decision-making power over the Organization's fate on the basis of its economic contribution.Present conditions demand that international peace and security be strengthened. In the Middle East the continuation of the conflict and the delay in starting a process of negotiations serve only to increase violence. A just and lasting solution  with rights and guarantees for all  can be based only on the merging of three substantive elements: the recovery by the Palestinian people of all its rights  including the right to form its own free and sovereign State; withdrawal from all occupied territories* and recognition of the right of Israel and all the States of the area to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized borders  in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions.Complying with the principle of non-intervention is a basic obligation of international coexistence and the indispensable partner of the right to self-determination .We are in favor of an urgent solution in Afghanistan  through the withdrawal of all foreign troops and respect for the independence and non-alignment of the Afghan people. Similarly  we support the immediate withdrawal of foreign occupation forces from Cyprus and its right to sovereignty and territorial integrity. We propose a negotiated political solution in Kampuchea  including the prompt withdrawal of foreign troops and the safeguarding of its national integrity and independence.In Central America acts of intervention constitute the main obstacle to the peace efforts of the Con tad or a Group and the Support Group. But Contadora is committed before history to peace in Central America  and its efforts will not cease. It is essential to continue to work for the establishment of conditions conducive to peace agreements. It is therefore essential that an end be put to all acts of intervention  coercion and harassment that can rekindle violence and cause an escalation of the conflict.In the context of that serious problem the Peruvian Government clearly reaffirms its solidarity with the people and Government of Nicaragua with regard to any act of intervention or aggression. we demand an immediate end to the military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua and respect for international legality  as enshrined in the recent advisory opinion of the Inter national Court of Justice.In the South Atlantic the continuation of the British military presence in the Malvinas and the permanent danger of an escalation of tension make it essential that the negotiations called for by the General Assembly start soon with a view to reaching a definitive solution to the problem  with respect for the inalienable rights of Argentinian sovereignty.In southern Africa the last battles against colonialism and racism are being waged. The peoples and nations of sisterly Africa must know that not only history is on their side; they also have with them all of us who uphold racial equality and the right to independence and the freedom of peoples.As an expression of that militant solidarity  the Government of Peru has established diplomatic relations with the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAFO)  which is in the vanguard of the struggle and the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia. Peru's participation in the machinery for action created in Harare bears witness to the fact that we likewise fully join in the commitment made at the eighth Summit Conference of the non-aligned countries to give all the support and help necessary to SWAFO  the liberation movements of South Africa and the front-line States in a struggle in which - however much it may be impeded by selfishness  arrogance and obduracy - victory is now seen on the horizon. We are deeply concerned at the negative trend in the international situation. None the less  we are encouraged by the conviction that we are not alone in our struggle  we see ever growing political trends within the industrialized countries against war  the use of force and acts of intervention - in other words  against any type of imperialist action. But the greatest encouragement canes from our own strength  from our peoples  from their indomitable fight for a more just  more free world  from their capacity to sacrifice  to do without  in order to uphold our struggle for economic independence and from our potential for collective action as a factor of social change in international relations.We  the non-aligned countries  constitute an important force in the present-day world. The fact that the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements did not remain petrified in time  that the cold war did not succeed in dividing the world into rigid zones of influence  that colonialism did not live on in the dreams of the colonizers  that the United Nations ceased to be the exclusive instrument of the Powers is largely thanks to the role played by the Non-Aligned Movement in its 25 years of existence.The Eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Zimbabwe  strengthened this process and reaffirmed the full validity of the Non-Aligned Movement as a valid choice for our peoples in reaffirming their independence and asserting their destiny. It is more necessary than ever before that the non-aligned countries  most of which have experienced a colonial past and which are now confronting an unequal structure of political and economic power  fulfill the historic duty of bolstering our unity and overcoming the problems that stand between our peoples and the better and more just world to which they aspire.Peru is fully committed and dedicated to that shared undertaking in brotherly solidarity with all the peoples of the world with whom we share the same devotion to peace  freedom  democracy and justice."
"108",5570,"PHL",41,1986,"It is the irony of the United Nations that so many new leaders have stepped to this rostrum  as I have today  with mixed feelings. Yes  we took power to implement so many cf the ideals that the United Nations stands for. We have restored human rights and liberated our people from the oppression and corruption of a Government that had long since lost their support. Yet  like so many other leaders before me  I am obliged to say that we did that by ourselves. It was the Filipino people alone who braved intimidation and cheating at the polls and  when their victory was stolen from them  turned out into the streets by the million to reclaim and secure it.Indeed  as our country bled at the hands of a Government that had lost all respect for the rights of our people  its leader's wife came to this rostrum to call piously for a new human order - this when thousands of Filipinos were political prisoners. And in the final months of the dictatorship international solidarity was expressed by ordinary people everywhere  who sat in front of their television sets and watched and cheered our revolution.In this year of all years  when in so many parts of the world we see people struggling to establish their human rights  I believe one must be frank to be relevant. I mean to use this occasion to share with oppressed people everywhere may own experience of how change is brought about.My basic conclusion can be stated very simply: to be free one can  as a people  effectively appeal to international standards of human rights set by others  such as the United Nations. Yet  in the end  to vindicate those rights  to achieve freedom  one is on one's own.The United Nations has stayed out of the internal affairs of nations. Its Charter orders that that should be so. Obviously this is wise in so far as it prevents abuse of the sovereign independence of nations. Yet it has also been an invitation to hypocrisy. The value of this Assembly should rest on us  its members  practicing what we preach. To my mind  that requires both realism and' concern when we address the affairs of others  realism in that we should not promise more than we can deliver.We should acknowledge what the Filipino people have learned; there is no substitute for action by an oppressed people themselves. But there should be concern about allowing this Hall to be abused by those who claim one standard of behavior and behave according to another back home. Do not misunderstand me. The United Nations should never be an exclusive club for one ideological model  for that would defeat its primary purpose  to keep peace in an imperfect world.There are many ways to run a country  but there is only one way to treat people; with decency and respect for their uniqueness as individuals. Only if those of us who have the responsibility of leadership respect our fellows and their essential right to find fulfillment in their lives can we hold our heads high here at the United Nations.The United Nations would lose all purpose if it were to set about judging one political system against another. Yet  equally  if the United Nations does not notice how governments treat people  it is nothing. I need only go back to the rousing words of the United Nations Charter. The United Nations is about people. If it fails them  can it be any better than its most corrupt and oppressive Member State? Even diplomacy  which is pre-eminently about States  cannot ignore  without peril or embarrassment  how States treat their people.And so  as the leader of a country which has this year enjoyed the sweet taste of freedom  again let me reconfirm our support for what the United Nations at its best stands for: the peace  freedom  dignity and partnership of mankind. But let me also at the same time serve warning to those denied freedom and dignity: do not look beyond yourselves to find them.He in the Philippines were strengthened in our resolve by knowing that people around the world shared our struggle. On their televisions and in their newspapers  they followed our drama. Further  we know that the rights we foughtfor are universally sought after they are enshrined = not entombed  mind you - in the United Nations Covenants. The importance of such international support should never be dismissed. It helped us knowing we were not alone.But even when the authors of the United Nations Charter stopped short of endorsing any right of interference in any nation's internal affairs  they were responding to more than the jealous realities of intergovernmental relations.Rather  they were reflecting a more lasting truth about how man prefers to order his life on this planet.People must be masters of their own fate. The Filipino people have known and been grateful for liberation at the hands of others; in 1898  a liberation that was swiftly betrayed  and in 1946  one which we promptly wasted. Yet now  having known the exhilaration of throwing off our bonds ourselves  I think every Filipino would agree there is only one real liberation.Only a people  already sovereign in their hearts and deeds  can win and keep their independence and freedom. This is not a pessimistic conclusion because  additionally  I believe that no government can indefinitely resist a people united against it.   It may have the guns  the goons and the gold. Yet  as we found in the Philippines  there is no government that can indefinitely resist a people determined to be free.And so  while the United Nations may not intervene to bring the sovereignty and freedom .enjoyed by nations to the peoples who are denied them  it should carefully avoid becoming an unwitting partner of their oppressors.I turn now specifically to the great moral issue that confronts this General Assembly: the situation in South Africa. To Nelson Mandela and his wife  Winnie  and all South. Africans  my prayers are with you. Mr. Mandela's long incarceration in prison  separated from his wife and family  inevitably reminds me of the imprisonment of my own husband  Ninoy Aquino.The lesson in my country and so many other places such as Argentina  whose President Alfonsin recently visited Manila  is that every act of repression reaps its final return. In the end  human values cannot be held down. They could not be in Argentina; they could not be in the Philippines. They will not be in South Africa.It is right that we all play our part in creating the environment for change in South Africa. The Philippines will support any action the international community takes to hasten the advent of peace and freedom in South Africa and to show solidarity with its people. But it would help the case a great deal if this forum were to take equal note and action against oppression wherever it occurs  wherever people are abused and degraded  be it blatantly or ostensibly in their own name. I do not believe that the force of moral action is diminished by being spread wherever it is needed. It is strengthened by exercise and weakened by neglect.Let me say directly to the millions of victims of apartheid in South Africa  to the families of those who have given their lives: do not waiver in your unity; look only to your own strength and determination..If there is one tactic that served us above all others in our movement for freedom  it was espousing a program of action that kept us united. In our case  this meant the use of non-violence and constant vigilance against the provocation of the authorities. Often  I was urged to go further: to call for a more confrontational line. But my constant concern was to keep the wide coalition of forces that backed our campaign together. Often  I disappointed some of my supporters by approving only limited actions against the Government. Yet it was the rock-like unity of the opposition and the enormous support it enjoyed that overwhelmed the Government. That meant not going faster than any of our supporters were prepared to go. This allowed us to overcome where more narrow-based opposition challenges had failed to dislodge the dictatorship.Perhaps the United Nations cannot go faster than its most reluctant Member towards its stated goals of peace  freedom and dignity for the peoples of all nations. And perhaps  for its more significant achievement  we should look rather to the peace it has helped preserve  and the co-operation it has fostered  between nations already friends  than to the peace it has failed to keep between nations bent on war. In the same light should we regard the salutary influence of its freedom-practicing members in the counsels of the world. Even so have I come to appreciate the achievement of our own regional organization  the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN's faltering steps towards economic co-operation and complementation  in the name of peace and stability in the region  are meant to serve and express the abiding peace and amity among its members that were there from the start.To nurture a vigorous peace wherever it abides and strengthen long-standing friendships: perhaps this is all that it lies in the power of international organizations to do.I have always been a firm advocate of peace. Perhaps it is only the tragedy of conflict that teaches us the true value of peace. Let us who are the loyal friends of peace continue to resist the temptation to exploit the conflicts of our neighbors. Those of us in ASEAN understand the crucial importance of these goals. Each of our countries has passed through periods of crisis when great rifts of weakness have appeared  yet none of the others  for all our differences in political systems and beliefs  has exploited the occasion; on the contrary  they have risen to it with encouraging expressions of sympathy and offers of help and mediation  ever respectful of the integrity of their tragic neighbor.And so my message today is an effort to bring this mission of the United Nations into sharper focus to the end that there shall be no more disappointments over unwarranted expectations. There will be no more wasted hopes on the part of those who must save their strength for the long and difficult struggle for peace and freedom. There will be  on the other hand  a clearer recognition by the United Nations of its irreducible commitments and values  a more jealous regard for their integrity and  for that reason  perhaps  a surer prospect of achieving the United Nations goals of peace  freedom  dignity and the partnership of mankind."
"109",5630,"PNG",41,1986,"On behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea  I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the important post of President of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that under your able leadership the work of this august body will be carried out with efficiency and success.I should also likeP on behalf of my country  to register our sincere appreciation for the excellent work performed by your predecessor  Mr. de Pinies of Spain. In addition  let me add my Government's voice to those who have already spoken in praise of the work being done by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cueilar.Papua New Guinea is situated in a part of the world which hears the name of peace - the Pacific Ocean. But we are no more immune to world-wide problems than are peoples in other parts of the world.Governments in our region have been able to make modest  but none the less effective  contributions to the resolution of regional problems. But we remain vulnerable to other problems. In fact  the island States of the South Pacific are probably more vulnerable to some problems than are countries in other parts of the world.The South Pacific is one of the few regions of the world where old-style colonialism is still to be found. People in our region look to people elsewhere for help and support in bringing colonialism to an end. We support people trying to free themselves from colonialism in other parts of the world.Despite its peaceful-sounding name  the Pacific is not remote from the arms race. In fact  some parts of the region are used by a number of nuclear Powers for weapon testing and target practice.The disarray in world commodity markets and the over-all decline in commodity prices affect us deeply.Growing indifference to the problems of developing countries  expressed by what people in developed countries carelessly describe as aid fatigue  is having profoundly adverse effects on Government's capacity to provide services for our people and to improve living standards in the future.The continuing failure by Governments in developed countries to address the issues raised by proposals  for a new international economic order makes even the modest goal of fiscal self-reliance  to which my Government is strongly committed  unnecessarily difficult to achieve.This year  1986  is the International Year of Peace. Under the United Nations Charter  all United Nations Members subscribe to peace. All of us say that we favor peace. But what have we really done to give effect to our common commitment?The United Nations  formed in the aftermath of the Second World War  was intended by its founders to be a vehicle for securing peace - genuine and lasting peace. Its founders recognized  as the Charter shows  that such peace involves more than the absence of war. They saw that genuine and lasting international peace can come about only if we attend to the underlying causes of international conflict.Inequity  the denial of basic human rights and the arms race are just as surely threats to peace as is naked military aggression.Yet  year after year  leaders from all parts of the world stand in this Hall and speak in favor of peace  but little or nothing happens. In fact  international tensions are increasing. The United Nations is now more than a generation old.Can we  the next generation  do no more? Surely  we must - for ourselves  for our children and  if humanity is to survive  for their successors  too.Papua New Guinea is a full  committed and - within the scope of available resources - active Member of the united Nations. For countries like mine  the United Nations is a vital - indeed  irreplaceable - means of securing national  regional and wider interests.Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have always believed that we have a general interest in preserving and increasing international co-operation. We have a particular interest in supporting a strengthened united Nations system. We are therefore concerned at actions which have the effect of weakening or reducing participation in the work of the United Nations.We urge other Governments to take careful heed of the Secretary-General's urgent warning regarding the financial state of the United Nations and to do what they can to help.Limited though our capacity to influence events may be  my own and other Governments in our region are nonetheless determined to use what influence we have to give effect to the principles embodied in the United Nations Charter. We fully accept the obligations that arise from sovereign equality among the nations of the world.My Government has thus recently concluded negotiating a treaty of mutual respect  friendship and co-operation with our closest neighbor  Indonesia. We believe that mutual respect is  and must be  the starting point of equitable and peaceful relations between sovereign States. Friendship and co-operation  the goals that all Members of the United Nations claim to share  must surely follow.Together with the Governments of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu  we have formed a spearhead group to monitor and act on issues of special concern to the Melanesian States. The spearhead symbolizes a united effort  not an aggressive weapon. The group does not threaten other countries or regional groups. It is strongly committed to wider forms of regional and international co-operation.In January  my Government decided to accede to the United Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. The decision gave practical expression to our active commitment to vital and universal humanitarianprinciples. We are already receiving some assistance from the office of the united Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).Despite successive united Nations resolutions calling for arms control and eventual disarmament  the arms race continues apace. My Government is pleased at the decision to hold a summit meeting between the leaders of the two super-Powers. We are hopeful of a positive result. We are dismayed  however  at the over-all lack of progress being made towards arms control  not to speak of complete disarmament. The nuclear arms race threatens not only the main contestants  but all other countries.Even if the ultimate horror of nuclear war can he averted  the destruction caused by the diversion of so much money  energy and talent away from the urgent problems of human suffering and development can only be described as obscene.My Government inevitably gives a high priority to the security situation in our immediate region  but we are not indifferent to events and situations elsewhere. We therefore continue to urge all concerned in the Middle East to reach an equitable and peaceful solution to their problems consistent with the right of Israel to exist and with recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. We urge Governments in the region to work in a constructive way to resolve common problems  we also urge all those concerned to work towards the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.My Government continues to be horrified at the terrible cost in human life and physical destruction caused by the war between Iran and Iraq. Here  surely  is an issue which goes to the heart of our common commitment to peace.Foe obvious reasons  Papua New Guineans are concerned with the rights of peoples in small States. Bar equally obvious reasons  we can only deplore the continuing loss of human life and the waste of resources caused by failure to respect those rights. We therefore reaffirm our opposition to the continuing Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea. We are pleased to note that there may be signs of movement on the issue. We urge all parties to pay close attention to the constructive proposals put forward by the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) for dealing with the issue.We also continue to deplore the ongoing occupation of Afghanistan by the armed forces of the Soviet Union. To our east  we urge all countries with interests in Central America to pay close heed of the efforts being made by the Contadora Group to bring peace andstability to the region.My Government looks to the Governments of North and South Korea to work towards peaceful reunification. We support the admission of both Koreas to the United Nations.In line with one of the deepest commitments of our foreign policy  we urge Governments in all parts of the world to show respect for the rights of independent countries of all sizes to be free from unwanted external interference.We call for greater co-operative efforts to deal with the causes of terrorism in the world and to counter inter national crime.Like other peoples who have experienced colonial rule  we Papua New Guineans not only value our country's independence but believe strongly that colonized peoples are entitled to their independence. Our conviction is  we know  consistent with the views expressed in numerous United Nations resolutions. Successive Papua New Guinea Governments have always supported such resolutions.Decolonization in the South Pacific has generally been peacefully achieved. The Governments and peoples of the former colonial Powers have remained actively involved in the region as aid donors  investors  trading partners and members of the South Pacific Commission.My Government is therefore all the more concerned at the direction that events in New Caledonia seem to be taking. Other Governments in the region are equally concerned. Since 1984  more than 2 0 people in New Caledonia  most of them members of the Melanesian Kanak population  have been killed by members of the French armed forces or by French settlers. Many others have been injured  even in the last few weeks. The previous French Government had  we believe  begun to react to the worsening situation in a serious and positive way.Delegations will be aware of the decision made by the 13-member South Pacific Forum  the paramount regional organization in the South Pacific  to call for the re-inscription of New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. The recent summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Move men t at Harare  Zimbabwe  strongly supported the South Pacific Forum's decision to call for self-determination and the early transition to an independent New Caledonia in accordance with the rights and aspirations of the indigenous people "" that is  the Kanaks.We are pleased to note the strong support expressed by a number of Governments during this session for the just struggle of the Kanaks for independence in New Caledonia. All of us who are concerned with the situation in New Caledonia look to the General Assembly for support to re-inscribe New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories during this session of the General Assembly.The South Pacific area contains many - indeed  all too many - of the world's remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories  as was noted at the Non-Aligned Movement's summit meeting. France is not only the major remaining colonial Power in our region; it is unashamedly and insensitively so. The Government of France seems to regard the South Pacific as little more than a useful site for testing weapons and a backdrop for the expression of its residual imperial aspirations.fty Government  like other Governments in the region  welcomes and appreciates the constructive role that the French and other Western European Governments play in our region through the Lome Convention and in other ways. But France is not a South Pacific country. New Caledonia is not a part of France. To suggest that either is the case  as the French Government does  is a delusion.New Caledonia is. by all criteria  a colony of France. So is the area the French Government persists in referring to as ""French Polynesia."" And so  too  are Wall is aid FVituna. The indigenous people of New Caledonia are not the same as Metropolitan Frenchmen. The Kanaks are Mslanesians. They speak and act through the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front  the FLNKS. Against ail reason  the French Government persists in regarding New Caledonia as part of France. It ignores the Kanaks. Where it cannot ignore them  it tries to silence them. It denies them opportunities for advancement. The French Government is generally indifferent and even hostile to the legitimate rights of the Kanaks. It intimidates the Kanaks. It actively supports the Kanaks' present and potential oppressors.In flagrant defiance of paragraph 8 of the Annex to United Nations General Assembly resolution 35/118  the French Government continues to import Frenchmen from metropolitan France into New Caledonia. It is engaged in a military build-up of such proportions that the French military presence in New Caledonia is approximately twice as large as the entire armed forces of all Forum island countries combined. There is now an armed French soldier for every two Melanesian Kanak families in New Caledonia. And the soldiers sent to New Caledonia to suppress the FINKS are entitled to vote in local elections  as are other short-term residents from metropolitan France.Through a combination of hostile propaganda  intimidation and active military intervention  the French Government seems determined to deny the legitimate rights of the Kanaks - rights which are theirs under the United Nations Charter.We find it deeply and sadly ironic that the Government of a country which has itself experienced the dreadful agonies of unprovoked terrorist attacks on innocent civilians is itself directly engaged in bringing terror to our region.My Government believes that we would be failing in our duty to the Kanaks and to the principles for which we stand if we did not bring the situation in New Caledonia before the General Assembly. The United Nations  which has played a vital role in the peaceful decolonization of the South Pacific  will lose credibility throughout the region if it does not respond promptly  decisively and effectively to the situation.The re-inscription of New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories is but a modest step. It threatens no one. It will  we hope  arouse the Government and people of France to a true appreciation of the wider implications of their actions and stimulate awareness of their true responsibilities and long-term interests in the region.In line with the strong stance that we have taken on New Caledonia  we support other calls for self-determination by peoples still subject to colonial rule elsewhere. In particular we support the legitimate right of the Namibian people to be free from South African oppression.Papua New Guinea's opposition to the vile principles and repellent practices of apartheid is a matter of public record. We deplore not only apartheid itself but the mounting cost in human dignity  life and property being paid by the African community as a result of the increasingly desperate attempts being made by the evil regime in Pretoria to maintain apartheid. We urge all Governments with a capacity to influence events in South Africa to use that influence to bring apartheid to an end. We condemn the Pretoria regime's repeated  unprovoked and flagrantly  illegal armed attacks on neighboring countries.As I indicated at the outset  my Government deplores the slew progress being made towards arms control and disarmament  especially in regard to weapons of mass destruction. We are totally opposed to nuclear-weapon testing in the atmosphere. We therefore repeat our earlier protests against continuing French nuclear-weapon testing in our region.Like most French people. Pacific Islanders do not want our children to have to breathe air  to drink water or to eat food which has been contaminated by nuclear pollution. People in our region have first-hand experience of nuclear-weapon testing that was supposed to be safe. They have injuries to show that it is not.We simply cannot accept that the French Government or any other nuclear Power has the right to continue testing nuclear weapons in our region. If it so safe  let them test at home.The South Pacific Forum has recently agreed to establish a Pacific nuclear-free zone under the Treaty of Rarotonga. The Treaty represents modest progress on a difficult subject.My Government calls for further and more comprehensive consultation on measures which will make the South Pacific truly free from the hazards of nuclear contaminationWe live in a world in which the economic circumstances of the developed countries have profound effects on the welfare and development prospects of developing countries. The point is made with some force in the latest editions of World Economic Outlook  prepared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  and Trade and Development Report  of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). We nay live in one world  but economic power  at least  remains remarkably one sided.My Government welcomed the historic special session of the United Nations General Assembly special session devoted to the economic crisis in Africa. We support moves to deal with the crisis. But we must not forget that hunger  the debt crisis and instability in commodity markets are world-wide phenomena with world-wide effects.Proposals for a new international economic order have been on the agenda of this Assembly and other international organizations since well before Papua New Guinea became independent* The need for progress is at least as urgent now as it was when the proposals were first formulated. But little  if anything  has happened.Some modest improvements have been made on a regional  and even on a multi-regional  basis. The contribution being made to North-South co-operation by the Lome Convention is an example. My Government is also impressed by the valuable economic and other benefits being reaped by people in South East Asia as a result of regional co-operation among the member States of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). We welcome the increasing interest being taken in the South Pacific by ASEAN members both individually and collectively. In the South Pacific  ray own Government and other Governments have been actively pressing for greater attention to be given to the existing structure of  and to the need to restructure  relations in the region. We have been particularly active in seeking the creation of a single regional organization. The concept of having a single regional organization for the South Pacific is important to us  not only because we seek to rationalize the activities of existing organizations but because we want to bring about a mare creative co-operative relationship between developed and developing countries in the region.We can no longer accept the colonial-type assumptions implicit in the constitution  the structure and the activities of the South Pacific Commission.We do not want to prevent Governments or other interested parties in metropolitan countries from playing a constructive role in our region  as I have said. But we are opposed to great-Power rivalry in the South Pacific. We cannot accept foreign domination.We note the increasing interest the Government of the Soviet Union is talking in our region. We value the increasing contacts between ASEAN and Forum countries.We look to the United States Government to play a positive role in resolving outstanding difficulties between the American Tuna-Boat Association and Forum countries over fisheries in the reqion.We hope that the French Government will be responsive to international concern over its activities in the South Pacific.We look forward to the day when a single regional organization can provide a framework and a means for constructive co-operation  based on sovereign equality and mutual respect  among all Governments with interests in the region. Such an organization will  my Government hopes  address a wide range of North-South issues on a regional basis: aid  trade  investment and other forms of mutual assistance.The Governments of Australia and New Zealand are already engaged in wide-ranging dialog on a variety of economic and other matters with Forum island countries. We would like to see other countries become more constructively involved in the region too. Development assistance should be replaced by development co-operation. My Government is currently discussing practical proposals on the matter with the Government of Australia. We would like  in time  to see the range of issues and the number of participants expanded.The Melanesian spearhead group has already taken steps to increase joint efforts to stem the flow of illegal narcotics into and through the reqion. Again  we would like to see our efforts taken up on a wider basis.The South Pacific is  mercifully  peaceful  not only in name but  when compared with other  more troubled  parts of the world  quite peaceful in actuality. The people of the region want it to remain so. Our independence must be respected. Forum island countries need assistance in developing our natural resources and human potential so that we can become truly self-reliant. Our relations with other countries must be restructured in accordance with the principles of the united Nations Charter."
"110",5676,"POL",41,1986,"I should first like to extend my delegation's most sincere congratulations to Ambassador Choudhury of Bangladesh on his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. He welcome him as a representative of a country with which Poland is linked by bonds of friendship.The United Nations has assembled for the forty-first time to respond to certain fundamental questions. Does the present state of security meet the expectations of humanity? What can and should be done to rid the world of the threats of the nuclear age  and safeguard the survival and progressive development of the human species?The disparity between the existing state of security and that hoped for by the international community becomes increasingly manifest. Human genius has been harnessed to perfecting the instruments of self-annihilation and each and every success scored in that regard only contributes to the likelihood of the outbreak of a global conflict. It is precisely for this reason that the international community so unequivocally identifies its supreme values: they are peace and security.Until recently the essence of security has been confined to the military domain. Today  in conditions of the ever growing interdependence of the countries of the world and the balance of forces  all  irrespective of political or ideological orientation  have concluded that the security of each and every State has a much broader base. In striving to make the world more secure  we must above all look at the differing interests of States and nations and find a common denominator. This denominator has two elements'  peace and development.The fact that efforts cure made to find such a common denominator does not mean that conflicting interests will disappear. The point is  however  that they must not be resolved through armed conflict. This is possible provided harmonious security is achieved in the political/ military  economic  social and humanitarian spheres  accommodating at the same time the security preoccupations of all States and regions of the globe.The United Nations has erected a structure for peace which  contrary to the intent of the Charter  is based on mutual deterrence. It has found itself balancing precariously on the edge of a nuclear abyss under the illusion that no one will take the ultimate step over the brink. Yet  as the arms race goes on  that brink comes inexorably closer and the abyss grows deeper. The United Nations now faces a choice - survival or extinction. The necessity to make that choice is becoming ever more urgent.Easy choices are tempting; small steps and great expectations that common sense will prevail and that a turn for the better will occur automatically. The lesson that history teaches us is to beware of easy solutions  to opt for the right choice even if it is a difficult one. To make such a choice today takes wisdom and courage commensurate with the threats to mankind's supreme values.The United Nations must complement the process of establishing international security from the top through decisions of and arrangements among the respective member Governments  by a practice of working out the foundations of that process from the bottom  starting with the minds of people.Universal  equal and indivisible security must stem from the political will of nations as translated in the policies pursued by their Governments. In keeping with the interests of all mankind  it has to be built above all by political means. Time is pressing. We cannot afford the luxury of waiting for the complete structure and the operating rules of an entire system to emerge from a negotiating process. Specific action has to be taken forthwith.The prevention of a global conflict has been the unassailable achievement of the United Nations. ""To save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and guarantee that force shall not be used in international relations remains the primary purpose of the Organization. Faced with the threat of total extinction  the call for the renunciation of war takes on a significance incomparably greater than the one which motivated the consciences and actions of the framers of the Charter.Poland has always adhered and will continue to adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter and to be actively involved in efforts to preserve peace and consolidate international security  the principle precept of its membership in the United Nations and its activities within the framework of the United Nations family.Never declaratory  that involvement of Poland and the socialist States in general was confirmed roost recently by their determination to establish a com pr eh ens ive system of international security mid the proposal of specific steps towards that goal. Those steps have been spelled out in the request for the inclusion of this question in the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly.There is a unanimous view today that the most critical problems facing mankind are curbing the arms race on Earth and preventing its extension into outer space. Obtaining and consolidating objective grounds for such a view are the basis of the initiative put forward at the fortieth session of the General Assembly by the Polish leader  Wojciech Jaruzelski  for a study to be prepared by eminent experts of different nationalities  under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  of the diverse consequences of the militarization of outer space.In our rationalized world  alarm is being sounded ever more frequently about the dangerous decline of human values. He heard it at the Congress of Intellectuals for a Peaceful Future of the World  held in Warsaw last January. Alas  in the very same world  there appears to be also a sufficiently fertile ground to nourish many hazardous myths. A number of Governments  the most zealous participants in the arras race  claim that the enhancement of armaments Programs is indispensable for the preservation of their national security. The greatest paradox of the arms race lies precisely in the fact that those participating in it themselves contribute - at an ever greater cost - to compounding the threats to their own security. Can mankind really afford to persist in such nonsense?I wish to repeat once again that  in our considered view  the most effective way of enhancing security and strengthening peace is to reduce the level of confrontation and undertake specific disarmament measures. There have been a host of concrete and oft-repeated proposals in this respect put forward by the Soviet Union  Poland  other socialist States and non-aligned countries  it suffices to follow them up. Alas  in regard to disarmament  especially in the field of weapons of mass destruction  one observes with dismay tendencies that are exactly opposite. Thus  on the one hand  there is an initiative calling for the elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2000; while  on the other  a decision has been taken to go back on time-tested international legal agreements that have helped to effect nuclear arms limitation. On the one hand  there is a unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests  extended several times already  while  on the other  there has been accelerated testing. On the one hand  a call has been issued for the elimination of nuclear weapons by the end of this century  proceed to the establishment of chemical-weapon-free zones and stop the proliferation of suchweapons; while  on the other  preparations have begun to start producing binary weapons.It is redundant for me to list the names of the proponents of the respective approaches. The tell-tale message of that list is sufficiently clear to make it impossible to shy away from pondering the different ways in which our common future is being designed in various parts of our globe. We in Poland do not hesitate to draw conclusions. It is precisely for that reason that we  together with other nations  are interested in a constructive development of the Soviet-American dialog  since it deals with questions of concern to all mankind related to curbing the arms race and limiting nuclear armaments. It is for the same reason that the Government of Poland has lent its support to the Delhi Declaration of leaders of the six States and for the initiatives contained therein pertaining to nuclear disarmament  the prevention of the militarization of outer space  and the cessation of the arms race.There is yet another aspect of the armaments race which I wish to mention from this rostrum. The point is that certain major Western Powers regard the imposition of the arms race on the socialist States as a handy tool with which to hamper and slow down their social and economic development. Such a policy must be resolutely counteracted.Military security is first of all an issue of global scope  but there is also an important regional dimension to it - as is most notable in Europe  the cradle of two world wars. it is in Europe that disarmament must be approached in a comprehensive manner  combining the elimination of weapons of mass destruction with a considerable reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces. This is precisely what the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty have proposed in their Budapest appeal to the States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and all other European States. The proposed reduction Program corresponds to the seriousness of the prevailing situation  contains no preconditions  and is open for businesslike negotiations. Its implementation would significantly lessen the threat of war in Europe and in the world at large; moreover  it would pave the way for a breakthrough in other disarmament negotiations concerning Europe  especially those held in Vienna.The States of the socialist community have been quick to appreciate first the thought that the regional perspective of the balance of force should be accompanied by regional concepts of security. The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe - today a major pillar of security and co-operation on that continent - is that notion's best supporting evidence. It has recognized that a future Europe of co-operation must be one of territorial and political status quo  since its people want to live within secure borders mapped out as a result of the Second World War  under such political systems as they themselves have recognized as offering them the best guarantee of their development.The European status quo dispute has been settled on the basis of coexistence  with the unqualified acknowledgment that European balance is of a lasting character  both politically and territorially. However  one can hardly ignore the fact that not all concerned either want or are able to reconcile themselves to that conclusion. They appear not to comprehend that mankind will never settle certain accounts with history  There are today both political forces and individuals apt to tolerate  if not encourage  calling into question the political and territorial realities in Europe  thereby fueling the ominous revival of moods for revisionism. Those tendencies represent a major obstacle on the road to the establishment of a safer Europe.Poland invariably attaches major significance to sustaining the process initiated at Helsinki in 1975 aid  indeed  to the extension of its scope so as to cover all areas of international relations  thereby developing an all-round security and co-operation system in Europe. The Helsinki Conference process  however  needs to be constantly upheld and developed. Poland is determined to make an active and constructive contribution to that process.In our view  full advantage should be taken of the forthcoming Vienna meeting of the States participating in the Helsinki Conference so as to generate new momentum for that process. It is very important that it end with the adoption of an agreed final document  all the more so since neither the Ottawa and Bern experts' meetings nor the Budapest Cultural Forum managed to adopt such a document.The agreement readied at the Stockholm Conference cm confidence and security-building measures constitutes an example to be followed on how goodwill and striving for compromise by all parties to a negotiating process can contribute to the elaboration of valuable international instruments.Poland's attention is not limited to the steps already under way. It is with concern that we think about the future of Europe and the world. Guided by that concern  Wojciech Jaruzelski stated the following a few days ago:""In three years from today we shall observe the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War. We would be happy to play host in September 1989 to a meeting of the representatives of States signatories of the Helsinki Final Act devoted to the crucial problems of peace  security and co-operation in Europe. We wish for a message of peace to resound from our capital  from the country that was the first to experience the aggression and cruelties of the Second World War. We wish for common conclusions drawn from the biggest war of all times to contribute to a better understanding and a more enduring accord among the States of our continent."" Disputes arising from contradictory interests must be settled by peaceful means  on the basis of the universally recognized norms of international law. If all of us assembled in this hall interpret peace and security to mean the same thing  this tenet can have no alternative.Unfortunately there is a vast gap between reality on the one hand and popular expectations and demands on the other.That gap will remain unbridgeable unless and until actions which are undertaken from a position of strength and which are nothing short of State terrorism cease. Nor will it be bridged as long as bloody regional conflicts fail to find their solution at the negotiating table.Further delay in achieving genuine negotiated solutions in the Middle East  southern Africa  Central America and other regions of the world is likely seriously to endanger world peace. Of equal urgency is the implementation of serious peace initiatives aimed at reducing tension  such as  for example  the proposals of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea concerning the Korean peninsula.Today  with multiple threats looming large  the significance of international law and the need for its development become more manifest than ever. With its basic norms being trampled upon by many States  it is necessary to come resolutely to the defense of the statutory and customary law of nations  the heritage of all mankind and the foundation of peaceful international relations. The norms of international law must be treated not in a formal way but rather in a creative manner  as instruments and guarantees of equitable international co-operation.Security must come to mean something more than merely liberating mankind from direct physical threat. It must also comprise the existence of material conditions promoting the attainment of goals set for themselves by individual nations  inter alia through their active participation in international economic relations. That is the principle reason why security in this field  which alas has been substantially eroded in recent years  is becoming so important.We are increasingly witnessing the growth of crisis phenomena in the world economy: the destabilization of trade  monetary and financial relations and of scientific and technological co-operation among States  as well as the deterioration of the economic situation of the developing countries. The consolidation of those phenomena foreshadows incalculable consequences and therefore calls for radical countermeasures. Specific steps to that end are envisaged in the concept of international economic security put forward by the Soviet Onion. I should like to point to only one - yet especially important -aspect of that concept  namely  the necessity of countering the practice of injecting political and ideological considerations into international economic relations and recourse to the economic weapon in the pursuit of political and ideological ends  through pressure and restrictions.Given the state of economic relations today  it is necessary to resort  not just to systematic solutions  but also to partial steps. These should apply  inter alia  to the problem of debt and development. That problem has become so acute and destructive that acquiescence in its continued existence may render useless any systematic solutions. The initiative put forward at the fortieth session of the General Assembly by Wojciech Jaruzelski concerning the establishment  under the aegis of the Secretary-General  of an international debt and development research center represents  in our considered opinion  a meaningful contribution to the search for an effective remedy in that regard.The strengthening of the foundations of international economic security can be brought about also through extension of the sources of economic growth and utilization of all reserves. It can be brought about through  among other things  dynamic international co-operation in the peaceful use of outer space and of nuclear energy. Quite recent events have offered telling proof of the critical importance of international co-operation in the field of nuclear energy. It can  finally  be made possible through recognition of the existence of a close relationship between disarmament and development and through reallocation for development purposes of at least a part of the resources otherwise squandered in the folly of the arms race.The effectiveness of an economy is dependent to a considerable degree upon the state of the environment  the preservation of which is indeed a precondition of man's survival  no less. If there really is something like a rudimentary generic solidarity of homo-sapiens  then the cause of protecting the environment must be put beyond and above any national  political or geographical divisions. Those are in fact the considerations underlying the proposal advanced by Poland at the last session of the General Assembly  urging the acceptance  as a universal principle  of an unrestricted flow of experience  licences and know-how relating to the protection cj the natural environment. In this respect the ideas put forward here on 23 September by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy  Mr.Giulio Andreotti  were of great interest.For Poland  the question of security in international economic relations is one of paramount importance. That point has been demonstrated repeatedly in its development strategy for the forthcoming decades  in its increased share in the international division of labor  in the growing openness of its economy as highlighted by its return to United Nations financial institutions and in its initiative concerning confidence-building in international economic relations. Poland strives to expand its economic co-operation with all States  in keeping with the principles of equality  non-interference in internal affairs and mutual benefit. Guided by those principles  we are interested also in the full normalization of relations with the United States of America  and not in the economic field only.To paraphrase the Constitution of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  it is in the minds of men that the defense of peace and security must be established first  for it is only on intellectually cultivated ground that international co-operation with a view to consolidating peace and security can yield a good crop. We have noted with satisfaction that the International Year of Peace has in that respect been a grand  world-wide campaign  designed to arouse minds and consciences. The consolidation of its achievements in promoting the idea of peace would be the best testimony of good will in the search for accord in a matter that mankind should value most.At the thirty-third session of the General Assembly  Poland came forward with a proposal that the Organization should focus its attention on the process of the preparation of society for living in peace. We have noted with considerable satisfaction that this theme received due prominence in the observances of the International Year of Peace. We are convinced that  as a result  mankind not only is more keenly aware of the significance of its most important right - the right to life in peace - but also has a much better appreciation of the necessity for activeengagement in its defense.While it is the principal right  the right to peace is not of course the only human right. We hold that international co-operation in the exercise of a whole set of human rights constitutes a major element in the consolidation of security in the world at large. Let me stress it: the point is co-operation  not ideological wars or anti-communist crusades. That co-operation must therefore be pursued in accordance with jointly elaborated and respected international legal instruments. It would seem that  given such a premise  the codification of as broad areas of human rights as possible would certainly play a positive role. Precisely with that consideration in mind  Poland has for a number of years been promoting  and will continue to promote  the elaboration of a convention on the rights of the child. We feel also that the role of the family deserves closer attention on the part of the United Nations. It is our intention to propose to the General Assembly consideration of the possibility of proclaiming some time in the future an international year of the family.This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the International Covenants on Human Rights and offers an obvious opportunity to assess their functioning. We derive considerable satisfaction from the important role which the Covenants have come to play in fostering international co-operation in the protection and development of human rights throughout the world and in promoting appropriate internal legislation. We shall reflect that assessment in a suitable draft resolution  the text of which the Polish delegation will be submitting at this session. At the same time  we cannot refrain from drawing attention to the disturbing lack of balance between the significance attached in the work of the United Nations to human rights and the unsatisfactory ranking of social problems. We are firmly convinced that there is a direct and unbreakable link between human dignity and liberty on the one hand and social justice on the other. Their full exercise is the basis for full respect for human rights. Unless there is upgrading of the standing of social development problems in United Nations activities  especially those of the Commission for Social Development  the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly's Third Committee  the progressive content of whose work could influence the world social situation  the inequitable treatment which these problems now receive is likely to worsen.The establishment of a system of comprehensive security is an enormously challenging task. It is indispensable to success in this task that all resources be released  both those we know of and those that we have yet to begin to look for. The former certainly exist in the consolidation and development of the United Nations system as a framework for positive interplay among the family of nations. It depends on the will of Member states  especially the permanent members of the Security Council  whether the system functions to the extent of the requirements and its own inherent possibilities  or succumbs to a politically motivated crisis.Poland is aware of the financial difficulties of our organization. We are in favor of reducing the operating costs of the United Nations  but the extent of that reduction has to be determined by the need to maintain the ability of the United Nations to fulfill its statutory functions under the Charter.There are values which have very special  indeed  supreme significance .for all Poles. They are the independence and sovereignty of our fatherland  its territorial integrity  security and peace. Our foreign policy has been unswervingly dedicated to the defense and consolidation of these values. Poland stands firmly for the peaceful coexistence of States with different political systems. The major challenges of today cannot possibly be tackled by anyone of the systems alone. It is not  therefore  the instinct of self-preservation alone  but also awareness of the imperative of rational co-operation that give us our marching orders today. Peace is of such vital importance chat it is worth making great efforts to reach a compromise to preserve it.The United Nations represents a time-tested framework for such co-operation. Poland  one of its founding Members  has quite deliberately and consistently joined the ranks of those States upon which the United Nations can at all times rely unfailingly in the pursuance of the purposes and principles of the Charter. It is with deep appreciation that we follow the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General of the our Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.The proposals and initiatives which Poland submitted earlier in regard to nuclear-free zones in Europe and European security and those submitted at the fortieth session of the General Assembly have all stemmed from our conviction that the Organization cannot possibly stand aside from the search for effective solutions to the major problems of the present time.The Polish People's Republic  in the future as in the past  will spare no effort to contribute to upholding and consolidating the role of the United Nations in the world of today."
"111",5747,"PRT",41,1986,"Please accept  Mr. President  my congratulations on your election. I am sure that your well-known qualities and long-standing experience of political and diplomatic life will enable you to make a decisive contribution to the success of the work of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly.I would also like to pay a special tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  for the competent and authoritative manner in which he presided over the last regular session of the Assembly. His success in the exercise of his important functions is certainly a source of pride to his country  to which I extend my congratulations.I wish also to convey to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our appreciation of the energy  commitment and devotion he shows in carrying out his mission as leader of the Organization in a troubled period in international life.The Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom  current President of the Council of Ministers of the European CeMBunity  has already presented the points of view of the Twelve on the different items of concern to the international community. Those points of view touch not just on Europe but on the rest of the world as well and carry the weight of expressing the consensus of 12 States  many of which  like Portugal  have long  rich experience of contacts with other continents. This being the first year in which Portugal has taken part in the general debate at the United Nations General Assembly as a full member of the European Community  I should like to make a brief reference to the great significance of that fact and the way we view the process of the construction of Europe.Notwithstanding the special links that throughout the centuries Portugal has developed with other continents  which are today translated into privileged ties with countries in Africa  America and Asia  Portugal is a European and eminently Atlantic nation. It was in Europe that  often against entrenched autocratic Powers  the values that we cherish first came to light and then took hold: the yearning for freedom  democratic life and respect for the rights of the individual.Thus  the historical and geographical context in which Portugal exists led us to make fundamental choices  manifested on the one hand in our participation in the Atlantic Alliance and in the maintenance of close relations with the United States of America  and on the other in our joining the process of European political and economic integration. The identity of the values of civilization of Europeans and Americans gives the Atlantic Alliance its full meaning as an essential instrument for the defense and preservation of free and democratic societies.Accordingly  Portugal views its active participation in the tasks of the Atlantic Alliance and its entry into the European Communities as two converging factors of its position within the international context.For the Portuguese people  belonging to the European Communities is a reaffirmation of its definite choice of a free  democratic and pluralistic organization of society  of the economy and of the State. Joining the European Economic Community does have an important economic component  which  we firmly believe  will be a powerful factor in the economic modernization of our country; but it was and still is  first and foremost  a political choice  reinforcing Portuguese democracy.In line with this position - representing a truly national option  shared by all Governments and supported by all democratic political parties - we look towards the construction of a more united Europe  increasingly able to speak on the international scene with a single voice as an important contribution to strengthening democracy in the world  refusing neutralist temptations or any other projects for casting Europe as a ""third way""  at an equal distance between the two strategically opposed Powers.We deem it indispensable that the risk of confrontation between these two Powers be reduced. But peace is a political task which is never fully ended and therefore is always in need of being undertaken anew. Arms are not  in themselves  a cause of war but only its instrument. Therefore we think that in order to achieve a lasting peace it will be necessary to work for the solution of the existing political conflicts. We are hopeful that both super-Powers will find paths of dialog and negotiation  possibly through meetings at the highest level.Portugal maintains a persistent and committed participation in all concerted efforts to achieve balanced  meaningful and verifiable results in the field ofdisarmament and aces control. In such a complex natter  it would be useful to look for concrete results in some areas that may serve as an example and standard for negotiations in other sectors. Thus  with regard to the elimination of chemical weapons  it will be of the utmost importance to reach an agreement on effective and trustworthy measures of verification. In fact  the possibility of credible verification is crucial to any just and balanced agreement on arras control or elimination.The final document of the Stockholm Conference establishes politically binding security and confidence-building measures far sore concrete and meaningful than those contained in the Helsinki Final Act. It was possible to bring the Soviet Onion to accept modalities of inspection which  although modest  point to an openness and transparency in military matters that Portugal has always advocated. My country was a co-sponsor of the main proposals on which the final document is based. As we see it  the positive results achieved in Stockholm were made possible by the constant co-ordination among the Western allies.We trust that in this domain  as well as in the fields of economic relations and human contacts  the follow-up of the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe - which soon will resume in Vienna - will pave the way for taking a step forward in the implementation of the principles enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act  thus making a decisive contribution to international detente  to a balanced and reciprocal content for relations among countries with different social and political systems and  further  to fulfilling the expectations of those who see in the Helsinki principles the way - or the hope - of accomplishing their destinies in freedom and reaching the level of progress they wish for.I cannot but express my satisfaction at the restoration of democracy in several countries the world over  particularly in Latin America  where several) nations returned to democratic political life  sometimes despite grim forecasts stressing the obstacles along that path. Portugal  which for nearly half a century lived under an authoritarian regime and 12 years ago returned to democracy  knows from its own experience how to appreciate fully the value of freedom. Allow me to mention the process of democratic reaffirmation going on in a great sister nation -I refer of course to Brazil - that stimulates and eases the closeness between ' Portugal and Brazil which their past and their common language require  which responds to the deepest sentiments of their two peoples and to which the authorities of both States are committed.Unfortunately  not all Latin American countries live under democratic regimes. There  as elsewhere in the world  we view with concern the persistence of dictatorships and of totalitarian regimes. However  we are convinced that where dictatorial repression exists popular determination will find a way to impose itself and freedom and respect for human rights will be restored. But the cases in which a totalitarian ideology is progressively being forcibly imposed on society and the State seem more problematic to us. As we all know very well  when this kind of regime takes hold  not only taking away from the people their political freedom but seeking also to control their whole lives  including private lives  and trying to direct individual consciences  then the restoration of freedom becomes exceedingly difficult.The cycles to the realization of the most fundamental civil and political rights that exist in some countries in Central America - whose situation is being debated else where in this General Assembly - are closely linked to the persistence in the region of a deep economic  social and political crisis  the main victims of which are the populations living in the area. We deem it essential that the different groups involved make a serious effort to reach  through dialog and national reconciliation  in a democratic and pluralistic framework  a balanced compromise for their interests and aspirations that may allow Central American nations to negotiate a peaceful solution to their differences  without external interference and within respect for the inviolability of their borders  in a climate of mutual trust leading to the reduction of the level of armaments in the region. Portugal regrets that the efforts developed in that direction by the Contadora Group and its Support Group have not so far brought forth results.The consolidation of democracy and respect for fundamental human rights  to be fully achieved  need growing economies that further social development. The stage of social and. economic underdevelopment of huge areas of the world  some of which are tragically stricken by hunger  is alarming. As was made clear by the report on the critical economic situation in Africa  which we debated here last May  in addition to factors internal to those economies - such as the neglect to which agriculture was long subject  the excess of unproductive expenditures in the state sector and the lack of incentives to small enterprises - there are negative factors at the international level  namely  the foreign debt of several countries and trade protectionism.Protectionism is an unjust and absurd practice  in particular if practiced by rich countries which thus make more difficult for other nations the access to hard currencies so necessary to balance their external accounts - a balance most important to the health of the international financial system. Moreover  when they give in to protectionist pressure  industrialized countries are going against their long-term interests  inasmuch as they are artificially impeding a more rational use of productive resources. At times Portugal has also been a victim of short-sighted measures of this kind.As regards foreign debt  the international community must acknowledge that the financial problem is compounded by political factors whose importance should not be underestimated. Moreover  in the economic and financial fields  mere restrictive prescriptions do not solve anything by themselves  while they call for heavy sacrifices and suffering.Development \s the only way out of the debt crisis. We welcome recent progress made towards taking these realities into account  but we deem it insufficient given the seriousness of the problem. External obstacles to development must be eliminated  be they of a financial or commercial nature -always with the awareness that development will not take place unless  within every national economy  there is the political will to generate favorable conditions for action and free initiative by economic agents.Portugal's accession to the European Community and the active part it intends to play therein will not cause us to turn our attention from our relationships in other areas of the world. Quite to the contrary: and history shows  we are a people open to the world and with a great capacity for merging with other cultures and mingling with other races. The Portuguese established fraternal contacts on practically all continents  always carrying with them a mentality opposed to any form of racism and a tolerant and open-minded attitude towards other civilizations.Given the crisis at all levels that has been affecting the African continent -particularly sub-Saharan Africa - the main thrust of our co-operation effort is being directed to that area  and specifically to Portuguese-speaking African countries. However  in addition to the economic co-operation effort so essential to countries which  for varied reasons  are facing problems of economic  financial and social development inherent in their recent accession to statehood  particular attention must be given to co-operative relations in the political field.Those relations should  whenever possible  be aimed at lessening prevailing political instability  particularly in the area around Angola and Mozambique. Portugal has spared no effort in contributing to the establishment of a climate or political dialog capable of paving the way for peace - and thence development -in southern Africa.Angola and Mozambique  together with their front-line partners  have been subject to a deterioration in security conditions that is seriously hindering progress towards peaceful development  to which their populations legitimately aspire. Let me reiterate Portugal's solidarity with the front-line States in the situation in which they find themselves and which makes development so much more difficult for them. That solidarity has also been expressed through the support we have been able to provide within the framework of the Southern Africa Development and Co-ordination Conference (SADCC)  as well as through the African Bank for Development - two outstanding examples of the ability of African countries to realize their enormous potential.At the political level  our solidarity finds expression in our support for efforts undertaken by the front-line States aimed at promoting dialog and exploring possible solutions to southern Africa's problems  as was done at the recent meeting attended by the European Community countries and the front-line States at Lusaka.The postponement of Namibian independence is surely one of the main factors of instability in the area. For several years now  in this and other international forums - the latest of which was the Vienna International Conference on the Immediate Granting of Independence to Namibia  held this summer - Portugal has demonstrated its interest in seeing that question solved. We continue to be firmly convinced that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is the only acceptable basis for a solution to this problem  and we are anxious at the successive delays and obstructions that have prevented its implementation.I wish to stress our apprehension due to the feeling that  of late  the question of Namibia has been allowed to drag on without any real effort being made to resolve it. We must break that stalemate  which besides contributing to destabilization in the area  only serves to exacerbate feelings of frustration in regard to the possibility of negotiating a peaceful solution to a situation that is in flagrant violation of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. To that end  commitment and a clear contribution from the Republic of South Africa are needed.Portugal's opposition to the apartheid system is not recent  nor does it stem from mere political expediency. That is demonstrated by the fact that  throughout the changing fortunes of its history  the Portuguese nation never indulged in racist practices in the territories under its administration. To oar firm condemnation of the apartheid system as a flagrant and systematic violation of the most fundamental human rights  we add our concern at the constant instability it provokes throughout southern Africa.Similarly  we unequivocally condemn armed aggression against neighboring countries. Moreover - and notwithstanding the difficulties inherent in the process of radical change in any society - it is urgent that the South African authorities and that part of the population that supports them prepare to face the present and look to a future which must be met boldly  imaginatively and fearlessly.We firmly hope that the South African authorities are prepared to show in a timely and credible manner that they are ready to abandon the illusion that delays  dashed hopes or violence can be an answer to the legitimate expectations of the majority of the population they rule. For South Africa to become a democracy.without winners or losers  it must urgently proceed to the complete eradication of the apartheid system. It is essential that the Government put an end to the state of emergency  free Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners and legalize banned political parties. On the other hand  all the forces legitimately fighting the apartheid system must also contribute to the cessation of violence and to the establishment of dialog  which is the only means towards a peaceful and lasting reconciliation of the various interests at stake.We believe that maintaining international pressure can help to make clear to the South African Government the need to hasten the process of change in that country  we must  however  concentrate our efforts at finding ways to bring home to that part of the South African population that holds power - and without whose participation a peaceful  negotiated solution acceptable to all cannot be conceived - the need for a change in attitude  without at the same time causing further deterioration to the situation of the peoples and countries already gravely affected by the apartheid system.Terrorism is an issue that has been with us for several years but which has of late known troubling developments  the seriousness of which is underscored by the intolerable fact that certain States support and promote it  as has become clear. It is highly regrettable that in the name of obscure and frequently senseless goals  supposedly responsible members of the international community sponsor common law crimes which affect and harm societies and individuals entirely unknown to them and from whose death or wounding they have nothing to gain.Through the adoption of conventions  resolutions and declarations of intent  the international community has on several occasions indicated its concern and its will to join efforts to eradicate that type of activity.But we must go beyond words. It is of the greatest importance that the international conscience be kept active and attentive to the requirements of the anti-terrorist struggle which  however  while it requires sacrifices  cannot be invoked to curtail fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. For its part  Portugal is actively participating in concerted efforts to conk at terrorism - at the regional level  in the Council of Europe and within the European Communities. It is  no doubt  an arduous and delicate task but one which admits of no hesitations it implies firm action internally and adequate co-ordination internationally  namely through the adoption of measures that will be effective in reducing opportunities for the individuals or groups concerned to carry out their projects.Among other grave problems that preoccupy us  I wish to stress the situation in the Middle East  because of the non-realization of the right to self-determination and other fundamental human rights  because of the tensions it breeds in the area and because of the frustration of the many and devoted efforts to reach a peaceful negotiated solution to the problems of the area. Portugal's position on this matter is well known. We believe that any solution to the problem must be global-  it must respect the right of all States in the area  Israel included  to live within secure and recognized borders? it must ensure the self-determination of the Palestinian people; and it must make possible the restoration of peace in Lebanon. Such a solution presupposes that the parties directly concerned will commit themselves to ar; effort to end the lack of mutual trust  which is an insurmountable obstacle to negotiation. In spite of the persistent difficulties in the way of diplomatic and negotiating efforts  we continue to place our hopes on their potential to find and unblock the way to peace. We sincerely hope that the recent contacts between the leaders of Egypt and Israel will be a step in this direction.Still in the Middle East area  I would like to mention our concern with the devastating consequences of the conflict between Iraq and Iran  two countries still at war  in spite of the appeals of the international community  for reasons ever more difficult to discern and with irreparable losses in human lives  lives that are being annihilated by a terrible potential for destruction  with serious consequences for the stability of the Gulf  where freedom of navigation continues to be seriously threatened. We appeal here to the leaders of those two countries to negotiate and  in that context  we reiterate our support for the mediation efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General in particular.In addition to these cases  there are others in which violations of rights -of which this Organization is the standard-bearer and which we are all bound to respect - are perpetrated with the deliberate intention of altering the geostrategical balances. Afghanistan and Kampuchea are two cases in point of countries and peoples victimized by the presence of foreign troops  in the most blatant violation of the right to self-determination  a situation that must  as a matter of urgency  be put to an end  for every reason  including that of maintaining confidence in the principle that respect for the sovereignty of States is the basis of international order.The requirements of credibility aid coherence which States must uphold as responsible agents of international relations are being particularly put to the test in the case of East Timor  where the Timorese people continue to live in the expectation of exercising their legitimate right to self-determination. As the internationally recognized administering Power  Portugal has supported in every way the mandate given to the Secretary-General by the General Assembly in its resolution 37/30 to try to find  for the problem of East Timor  a global and just solution acceptable to all parties. We greatly appreciate the efforts undertaken in that direction by the Secretary-General in the last few years. We have shown our readiness for dialog  without which international disputes cannot be solved. Although we are not as yet close to the desired solution  we continue to negotiate  in the hope of reaching a globally positive result.We do not forget our goals  our commitment to the preservation of the cultural heritage of the Timorese people and of its own identity  the defense of its freedoms and of individual rights in that territory. However  it is not possible to fulfill the legitimate expectations and rights of the Timorese people if they are denied the freedom to choose their own destiny. To us respect for the principle of self-determination of peoples is fundamental. I an sure that it will not be any less so for the international community.I believe that the grave financial situation in which this Organization finds itself is a cause for concern that I share with all members of this Assembly. In the years of prosperity  there apparently developed a tendency to see in the United Nations a deus ex machina capable of embracing and solving the problems of one and all. The international situation that has in the last few years affected many of the Member States was brought before this Organization with some delay and  perhaps for this reason  to the surprise of some of us. Austerity is now called for. The figures show - in such a way that no doubts can be entertained about this point -that expectations have to be reduced to the level of existing resources. The financial crisis certainly reflects a crisis that could be called a ""growing up crisis"" but which reflects a reality we can only call political.In permitting the participation of all States in decisions related to the safeguarding of peace  respect among nations  protection of the rights of man  justice  freedom and economic development  the united Nations performs the essential function of upholding pluralism among nations. It would be difficult indeed for the United Nations not to mirror the contradictions inherent in this reality.)The united Nations will overcome the present crisis. However  it will have to fight atavisms  to abandon theoretical needs that are frequently translated into requests which sometimes make the Secretariat look like a research department. We must be realistic: where there is no room for agreement  we must work to create the conditions necessary to obtain it  without trying to disguise  with bureaucratically initiatives  difficulties that are known to all. The Member States must take the responsibilities that fall to them as their lot in this situation without overlooking the fact that careful management of resources and the timely payment of contributions are basic elements in the political life of the united Nations.We would like to make clear that if we support the introduction of a greater financial discipline in the United Nations  we do not in any way wish to limit or hinder the capacity to act and the vigor of the Organization. On the contrary  we desire to strengthen its credibility. We wish therefore to find a solution for the financial problems of the United Nations  not only for economic reasons  but because we want to see its capacity for intervention reinforced  its initiatives respected  and its voice listened to. In this sense  Portugal firmly supports the efforts of the Secretary-General and awaits with eager expectation the results of the work of the Group of Eighteen.The general debate that takes place annually in the General Assembly has the merit of taking us beyond our own particular concerns  which often absorb our day-to-day activities  to a global appreciation of the problems that the world is facing today and to re-examine its multiple aspects. The last few decades have been rich in events  many of which have brought with them the potential for radical change  which has left its mark cm societies  both internally and externally  and has forced them into frequently painful processes of adjustment. The intensity and the dynamics of such processes have provoked and still provoke a series of readjustments  which have been  and are being  felt at the most varied levels. However  if we take into account the complexity of the time in which we are living and the evolution of the international situation in the 41 years since the actual format of international relations developed  we will  in spite of everything  be led to formulate a favorable judgment about the capacity generically shown by the diverse agents to manage the innumerable crises they have faced and to live up to the challenge of progress. Portugal and the Portuguese people  whose recent history illustrates the importance of the struggle tor democratic pluralism  for freedom and for justice  confidently accept this challenge."
"112",5793,"PRY",41,1986," I wish first  on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Paraguay  to offer a cordial greeting to the President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  the Minister for Foreign Affairs for Bangladesh  Hunayun Rashid Choudhury  and to express our most sincere hopes that the Assembly's debates will result in fruitful resolutions in the interest of international peace and security.He also wish to extend greetings to the Secretary-General of the Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to whom we express our whole-hearted gratitude for his commitment to the tasks of the Organization  which he serves faithfully as a man of international stature and the highest official of the United Nations.Paraguay is present in the Assembly in the spirit it has always shown  in the firm belief that the role which the united Nations is called upon to play in the world should be one of most effective  pragmatic leadership  in the interest of the maintenance of international peace and security  in an environment of order and compliance with international law.We cannot understand the equivocal conduct of some countries  large and small  which oppose the participation of the United Nations in conflicts  relegating the universal Organization to the position of a passive onlooker in the interplay of world or regional interests.The Republic of Paraguay notes with growing concern the incorrect position of those that  ignoring the counsels of reason and international practice  are against the direct participation of the United Nations in the various conflicts throughout *.he world. Paraguay has confidence in the Organization and wants to see it become more active every day for the benefit of man in all regions of the world.The Paraguayan people are celebrating this Inter national Year of Peace with festivals and other commemorative events. We enjoy peace and live in peace with our neighbors and brother countries. Ke enjoy peace  and the Government and people work together to achieve economic  social aid political development  seeking to ensure the continuous improvement of our democratic institutions and of the living standards of our people.The Paraguayan people  which freely and democratically elected the constitutional President of the Republic  General of the Army Alfredo Stroessner  know that they have a strong  stable Government which  within a framework of loyalty to the Constitution and the law  is working for peace and the continued development of the country  without allowing any adverse forces to stand in its way. There have been no insurrections or fighting between brothers and fellow countryman.The black legend about Paraguay spread in international circles has been laid to rest and even the most fanatical opponents of the Government of President Stroessner have to admit that under his leadership peace is a reality and that the country moves forward every day towards the goal of permanent well-being for the Paraguayan people.The international press  in the past incorrectly or only partially informed  has now ascertained that there are periodic elections in Paraguay  in accordance with the Constitution  end that the legislative branch of Government comprises two houses  which include representatives of three political parties* legally registered  within a system of democratic pluralism and participation. The judiciary acts independently in accordance with the Constitution and within the system of the independence of the branches of Government.The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization for the current year  apart from being a valuable document outlining the most important aspects of present world problems  is also a rigorous introspective analysis of the Organization itself  its accomplishments  its frustrations and  above all  its prospects for the future  which are viewed with quiet confidence.The treatment of the various issues that relate to the primary objective of peace in all the regions of our troubled tor Id  which are increasingly interdependent  reflects a valuable effort of objectivity and balance and honesty of purpose and method that puts that effort above all interests that do not coincide with or could prejudice the positive future of mankind.We commend the important work done by the Secretary-General and enclose his wise comments and conclusions  which carry for all nations a message of faith and hope.We follow with particular attention the work and negotiations in the sphere of disarmament. We believe that it is an offense against the world to continue with the arms race  which involves many countries - not only those with high levels of economic development  but also those with limited resources.This is one of the most urgent problems on our agenda  because while hunger and malnutrition cause the death of thousands of innocent children  all over the world multi-million dollar sums are spent to purchase weapons of death and destruction. The Republic of Paraguay devotes a large share of its income from the national budget to development in all areas  with the valuable co-operation of friendly countries and international organizations  such as the United Nations Development program  the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.Much has been said  both within and outside the United Nations  on limiting nuclear and conventional weapons and on disarmament in general. We fervently appeal to all the countries represented here to end the arms race so that peace with justice may serve as a basis for international life  in accordance with the hopes of all the people on earth.There are some questions that seem to have heen left completely outside the work program of our Organization. It is time that the interests of certain countries and the ideologies of certain Governments did not prevent us from determining  for example  a precise definition of what is ""aggression"" in the field of international law. It seems paradoxical that while we continue to witness armed conflicts in various parts of the world  it has not been possible for United Nations bodies to arrive at an objective definition of the word ""aggression"".Paraguay hopes that the United Nations will maintain and increase its effective role in the maintenance of international peace and security. To this end we agree that it must strengthen its negotiating capacity in areas where there are disputes. This must be the heart of the Organization's work if there is to be an effective peace in which men of good will can find a haven from war and destruction.We continue  as in the past  to condemn the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. We also condemn the invasion of Kampuchea by Viet Nam with the help of a super-Power. In both cases our country has supported all the resolutions adopted by the United Nations calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops and supporting all the efforts undertaken in a spirit of good will to find a peaceful and rational solution to these contentious disputes.The Republic of Paraguay is amazed to see that the war between Iraq and Iran  virtually undeclared as far as international law is concerned  is continuing the cruel confrontation between two nations which desire nothing but peace. We hope that the United Nations will be able to find a solution satisfactory to both sides. Similarly  we trust that there will be a just solution of the Cyprus problem  in accordance with the rules of law  a problem which remains on the list of serious unresolved problems. He consider that the problems of the war in the Persian Gulf and the question of Cyprus must be settled through direct negotaticns between the parties involved with the help of the Organization.The question of the Middle East deserves special attention. The existing situation in that region is truly a cause for concern for the peoples of the world. The time has come for the State of Israel to live in peace and harmony with the Arab countries of the region. To that end the United Nations must intervene effectively and to practical effect  first of all eliminating the outside influences involved in this conflict. Resolution 242 (1967) remains the keystone of any solution to the conflict; it represents the only viable  humane and worthy course for all negotiation between the parties. Paraguay desires a harmonious coexistence for all the peoples of the region.We have faith in the work of decolonization which the United Nations has long been carrying out. Faithful to our stand for freedom and for respect for the s elf -de termination of peoples  we support its policy  always provided that it does not seek any interests other than those of upholding the free expression of the will of the communities involved within the framework of respect for international law and the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of states and the integrity of nations. Consequently we maintain that in accordance with the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council  Namibia has a eight to self-determination and independence.The universality of the United Nations is one of its most important attributes. It is herd to see how the work of the Organization could have practical effect outside the context of universality. We therefore believe that the Republic of Korea has every right to be a Member of the Organization. This position is based on the peace-loving and progressive spirit of its people and Government and the respect which the Republic of Korea has always shown for the mandates of the United Nations in a volatile area of the world.We advocate the reunification of Korea through the peaceful means of dialog and negotiation  and we regard as constructive steps towards the attainment of this final objective both the continuation of direct talks between both parties and their admission to membership of the United Nations.This is also the case of the Malvinas Islands  where two friends of ours  the Republic of Argentina and the United Kingdom are confronting each other. Here we have maintained the urgent need for a negotiated aid friendly solution  in accordance with the principles of international law  on the basis of acceptance that this is a dispute about sovereignty. In line with this spirit we support all steps which may be taken to find  through negotiation between the parties  a just and lasting solution to this problem.The Central American problem is of concern to the Republic of Paraguay and tothe American continent as a whole. We must state here that that problem has rootsoutside the region and that the expansionist interests of a super-Power that has no business in this part of the world are playing a decisive role and provoking a logical reaction on the part of the other super-Power  which cannot allow the defense of the Western and Christian world to be endangered. In that regard we condemn  in the name of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States  the intrusion of the Soviet Union into the Caribbean and Central America  directly or indirectly.Meanwhile  time passes by and matters become entangled and confused  resulting in the intrusion into the very heart of Central America  where North and South America are linked  of a country with a strong ideological and logistical commitment to the expansionist interests of a super-Power from another continent.It is with legitimate concern that we roust state that the chapter on the world economic situation is an increasingly disturbing one and portentous of a serious situation capable of leading the world to a collapse of the financial and commercial order.To the classic dilemma of the problem of North-South relations  rooted in the permanent decline in raw material prices and increase in those of manufactured goods  with the staggering result of a permanent deterioration in the balance-of-payment ratio of the developing countries  we are now faced with the burning question of foreign indebtedness.That problem is not only economic or financial in nature. The renewal or recognition of foreign debt are not the only things at stake. It is not merely a matter of playing with figures  increasing or decreasing interest rates or amortization installments. The over-all problem of foreign debt has political and social implications of such far-reaching consequences for the third world that thehighly industrialized and rich countries have the unavoidable obligation to solve it as soon as possible in order *o avoid a more severe economic recession that could lead us to the brink of the abyss that already yawns in our path.What can be done by countries whose exports do not enjoy stable prices on the international market  that have contracted debts to develop such exports and that  owing to lack of resources  are unable to amortize those debts? The problem challenges the right of all peoples to their very existence and calls into question the position of the rich and wealthy nations confronted with such poverty  such despair and such real hunger.As in the past  the Republic of Paraguay continues to be concerned by a scourge that affects every continent and that  instead of gradually abating  is steadily on the increase. We refer to international terrorism  a tragic plague of the modern world  which criminally and without pity strikes at innocent lives anywhere in the world on the most futile pretexts and with goals that cannot be achieved.We cannot agree that terrorism is justified by some underlying causes  even though we recognize the reality of some of them. It is time  however  that nations represented here unite to condemn the wave of terrorism from wherever it may come  without concessions to anyone  to any group or country. There is no action or phenomenon that can justify terrorism for its own sake  much less allow certain territories serve as training-grounds for terrorists or allow some countries to help such barbarians by selling or donating weapons and explosives.In this area the prestige of the United Nations is at stake for  if this question is not solved once and for all  the Organization runs the risk of being left without legal or moral grounds for its existence and for the role it is called upon to play in alleviating the problems of the world.The Republic of Paraguay  a land-locked State  recently ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It did so in the context of itsconfidence in the just cause of land-locked nations  since the Convention ensures that important group access to and participation in the resources of the oceans. It has also ratified its legitimate right to transit to and from the seas through the territories of neighboring maritime States.He believe in the moral and legal values of our Organization and its work to achieve codification of international law  a matter that would have seemed Utopian a few years ago. We support the work of the united Nations and its organs  such as the Economic and Social Council  in the field of the advancement of women  the protection of children and all questions to safeguard the dignity of man at all levels  without distinction as to sex  religion or race.Paraguay has always oo-opera ted with all agencies of the United Nations system  including the United Nations Commission on Human Rights  in a spirit of understanding and commitment to the cause of human rights. This year the Government of Paraguay received the visit of an independent expert on human rights  a representative of the aforementioned Commission. That expert worked freely and held talks with' persons he wished to see  traveling throughout the country without interference of any kind. He saw with his own eyes the freedom of speech and press that prevail in our country  freedoms that the biased  whose motives are unavowable  try to deny i.i international forums.I wish to note our recognition of the co-operation we receive from the United Nations Development program. Unfortunately  that co-operation has been curtailed because of budgetary constraints that have their origin in the cuts in contributions made by the wealthiest industrialized countries. We urge the more developed nations to increase their generous contribution to that program to enable it to work towards its important objectives  which benefit the less-developed peoples.Nuclear-weapon-free zones and denuclearized zones continue to be of essential importance for the future. He reaffirm the principles embodied in the Treaty of Tlatelolco  which stipulates that Latin America will be a region free from such dangerous weapons. On the basis of the recent disquieting experience that threatened not only Europe but the entire world  the United Nations must establish standards to regulate the compulsory maintenance of safeguards against the expansion of environmental pollution around thermonuclear stations or nuclear plants. All that can be done in this field will be precautionary and will avoid serious problems in the future.We view with pleasure the proposal of the Government of Brazil on the setting up of a zone of peace and co-operation in the South Atlantic. It is a plausible initiative for all neighboring countries of the region  which are continuously in search of peace and which view with apprehension the events that took place in the region not too long ago. That initiative deserves comprehensive analysis by the Assembly.The Republic of Paraguay  which lives in peace and co-operation with its neighbors  as proved by the joint construction with the Federative Republic of Brazil of the Itaipu Dam  the world's largest hydroelectric plant  which is already producing electric energy for development  and the Yacyreta Dam  undertaken jointly with the Argentine Republic and which is currently under construction  hopes that the United Nations will be the most fruitful means of bringing about peace and international security throughout the world and among all peoples of the Earth. We hope that the task of the Organization and of all its system and agencies will bring about the effective solidarity of those nations that can do the most to aid the developing and least developed countries economically.Only in this way and within that spirit of co-operation  disinterest and altruism for the development of everyone will we be able to conquer the obstaclesthat today still exist on the way to our goal - mankind living in peace  with social and economic justice and without any lasting danger to international peace and security."
"113",5858,"QAT",41,1986," It is indeed a pleasure to stand before the Assembly and extend to Mr. Choudhury  in the name of Qatar  my most sincere congratulations on his election as President of the present session of the General Assembly  which we hope will be successful and fruitful. His election is an expression of faith in his person  his vast experience and his great knowledge and ability. We are confident that he will put those attributes at the service of the international community during the term of his presidency. His election is also a reflection of the positive role played by his country through its membership in the United Nations   Nor can I fail to mention the good relations and historical ties that exist between our two countries. We take a keen interest in furthering those relations.I take this opportunity also to extend my thanks and appreciation to Mr. Choudhury's predecessor  who conducted the work of the previous session with great ability and competence.Similarly  my thanks go to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for his efforts to strengthen the Organization and its role  in order to safeguard peace and security and end all the conflicts that cloud the international climate. The State of Qatar praises and supports the valuable report on the work of the Organization submitted by the Secretary-General to the present session of the General Assembly.The respect and appreciation enjoyed by the United Nations as an international organization embodying the highest human ideals and dedicated  as stated in the Charter  to safeguarding international peace and security make it incumbent upon us all to strengthen its role  respect its decisions and recommendations and implement and abide by the principles of the Charter.** Mr. Dos Santos (Mozambique)  Vice-President  took the Chair. However  we note with great regret the failure of certain Members of this Organization to abide by its resolutions and decisions  and the inability of the Organization itself to compel those Members to do so. That state of affairs makes it incumbent upon us all to strive seriously and sincerely to find ways and means of compelling all Member States to abide by the decisions of the United Nations. Otherwise  what is the point of their joining this Organization?This should not be taken as a denial of all the efforts that the United Nations and its Secretary-Genet.^ have made and are still making on all fronts to strengthen international peace and to consolidate the effectiveness of the Organization. In this regard I must note the excellent work of the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations. It is only natural that 40 years after the establishment of the Organization  and in view of the increasing responsibilities and functions entrusted to it  a financial and administrative evaluation should be undertaken with the aim of improving its working methods  increasing its efficiency and securing additional resources with which it can serve the noble objectives for which it was founded.My delegation would like to affirm the importance of the political element and of a sincere political resolve by Member States as essential to the upholding of the principles and purposes of the united Nations Charter and the implementation of its decisions. That would strengthen the Organization's role and renew the international community's faith in it  thus ensuring a positive response from that community which would result in the Organization receiving the financial contributions it needs to clear away the obstacles in its path.The Palestinian question remains the most glaring example of failure to abide by United Nations decisions and resolutions and of attempts to obstruct them. Ever since its usurpation of the land of Palestine and its expulsion of the legitimateinhabitants of that land  the Zionist entity has represented the main challenge to the will and decisions of the United Nations. It continues to practice its terrorism and aggression against the Palestinian people both within and outside their homeland. Prom the beginning  it worked hard to expel them from that land by force of arms. Massacres and genocide awaited those who did not leave. Yet the Zionist entity was still not satisfied. It pursued the Palestinian people into their refugee camps  seeking their physical and psychological destruction.Furthermore  it extended its aggressive attacks to neighboring Arab countries and annexed part of their lands  on the flimsy pretext of safeguarding its own security. There may well be people who believe that absurd fiction  but who can explain the Zionist entity's aggression against the Iraqi nuclear reactor  which was built for peaceful purposes  or its aggression against Tunisia  hundreds of kilometres from its borders? Regrettably  there are those who despite all this are still ready to give the Zionist entity all the moral and material support it needs  together with the most sophisticated weapons  which it uses to kill Arabs wherever they are to be found.«The Palestinian question is the core of the Middle East conflict. All other developments and secondary problems in that region arise solely out of that central issue. -The Middle East  that sensitive part of the world  will know no tranquility or stability until the Palestinian issue is resolved in a just and humanitarian manner  with the Palestinian people regaining the land from which they were expelled  and being allowed to establish an independent State on their national soil  under the leadership of their sole authentic representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization (FLO).The international community can expect only increased tension and adverse consequences if a just solution is not achieved and if the racist Zionist aggressor is allowed to continue its suppression of and aggression against the Palestinian Arab people  thus trailing under foot the most basic principles of humanity and international law  and to continue to deny the Palestinian people their historic rights and to destroy their identity  culture and institutions.In addition to the Palestinian question there is another very important and serious issue: the Iran-Iraq conflict. The war between Iraq and Iran has entered its seventh year. We are all well aware of this destructive conflict's human and economic cost for our two Muslim neighbors. We are also well aware of the threat that the continuation of the war poses to the security and stability both of the region and cf the whole world as a result of its harmful effect on freedom of navigation and on international trade. This situation must necessarily be damaging to international co-operation.Together with its fellow members of the Gulf Co-operation Council and other Arab and Muslim States  Qatar has spared no effort in seeking an end to this destructive war. It has called on the international community - particularly the United Nations - to make every effort to find a peaceful solution that would guarantee to each of those two countries its legitimate interests and historical rights. It is unfortunate that all these international  Arab and Muslim efforts have thus far been in vain.The members of the Arab Gulf Co-operation Council welcome Iraq's positive stand  as represented by its willingness to respond to all initiatives and to put forward ideas and suggestions for peace between the two countries  and they still hope that wisdom will prevail and that Iran will respond to the desire of the Muslim world - indeed  the world as a whole - for the two countries to arrive without delay at a definitive solution to end their war. Such a solution could be founded on the basis of safeguarding all legitimate interests  and on the principles of good-neighborliness  respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.The State of Qatar views with increasing concern the events in Afghanistan  a Muslim country with which we have strong historical ties  which has become another hotbed of tension. The presence of foreign troops on the soil of Afghanistan against the will of its people represents a dangerous threat to the peace and security of that country and has led to a conflict whose eventual scope and consequences no one can foresee. My country hopes that those foreign forces will be withdrawn soon and that the Afghan people will be given the opportunity to choose the political system that suits them best.The present situation in southern Africa is of primary concern to us. It is our sincere hope that suitable solutions will soon be found to ease tension and put an end to the suffering of the peoples of the region and to the repeated aggression perpetrated by the racist regime of Pretoria against its neighbors. We hope that that despicable regime will abide by the United Nations decisions and allow the African peoples to govern themselves.Recently my country participated in the summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement  held at Harare  Zimbabwe  in a country that was a bastion of racism in Africa until its heroic people set an example by their national struggle and steadfastness in the face of racism and won its freedom and independence.My country supports all the decisions adopted by that Conference  particularly those concerning the problem of apartheid in South Africa and Pretoria's policy of denying the majority its right to participate in governing its country. We reaffirm our support for and solidarity with the just struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  and the heroic struggle being waged by the majority in South Africa against the ruling racist minority.It is the responsibility of us all to mobilize international public opinion in support of these just causes. We call on the countries that co-operate with the racist regime to put an end to their financial and military support and boycott that regime commercially in order to force it to abandon its implacable racist policies.My delegation followed closely and with great interest the deliberations of the General Assembly at its special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. We welcome the Declaration adopted at that session and the good intentions that were expressed by industrialized countries. We hope they will be translated into positive action at the earliest possible time and that the international community will perform its humanitarian role in helping the African countries overcome the negative effects of circumstances  mostly beyond their control.The present situation can bs resolved only through concerted efforts insupport of the efforts of the African countries themselves to overcome the negative consequences of their critical economic situation.We look forward to an international community in which peace and security prevail  in which all States and peoples co-operate and live in equality. It is in that context that we repeat our call to the United States and the Soviet Union to put an end to their cold war  the intensity of which has increased in recent years. We urge them to end the arms race in which they are engaged and work together to improve the chances of peace and of finding just solutions to the chronic and the urgent problems in the Middle East  southern Africa and Latin America.-he world economic crisis continues to wreak havoc on the developing countries. The international community as a whole is vulnerable and exposed to its consequences owing to the interdependence of interests. The debt and interestburden has readied phenomenal proportions in the third world. The deterioration of the terms of international trade  the consequences of the protectionist policies adopted by the industrialized countries and the decline in the prices of commodities produced by the developing countries have all come at a time when inflation and prices have risen in the developed and the developing countries.This critical economic situation  represented by inflation  recession and a decline in the prices of raw materials  must impel the international community to realize the necessity of resuming the North-South dialog in order that agreement may be readied between the industrialized and the developing countries for the setting up of a new economic order or improving the present one. Only then will a solution be found to the current economic difficulties.Economic development is the only means by which the developing countries can settle their foreign debt  which represents the major crisis facing these countries and can lead to their financial collapse. In this context  and in order to stimulate growth and development  we call for an increase in imports from developing countries along with a genuine reduction of interest rates on the outstanding debts of the debtor countries. We also call for an increase in lw-interest loans extended by international lending institutions and the extension of repayment periods.On the other hand  the developing countries should develop their economic policies in such a way as to allow for the stabilization of consumption and the optimum use of credits to set up investment projects guaranteed to generate work opportunities."
"114",5904,"ROU",41,1986,"May I begin by warmly congratulating you. Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. It is indeed a great pleasure to greet in that high office the representative of Bangladesh  a country with which we are linked by bonds of traditional friendship and cooperation. I am sure that your well known qualities and long-standing experience of political and diplomatic activity will make a decisive contribution to the success of this session.Being empowered by the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania  Nicolae Ceausescu  I have the honor to put forward his and Romania's position  assessments and considerations on the main problems of international life  which are to be discussed at this Assembly session.The proceedings of the General Assembly are taking place at a time when the international situation continues to be particularly complex and serious owing to the escalation of the arms race  in particular the nuclear arms race  the aggravation of some military conflicts and the emergence of new hotbeds of tension  the use and threat of force and interference in the internal affairs of other States.These are all increasing even further the danger of a new world war  which under present conditions would inevitably turn into a nuclear catastrophe  without victor or vanquished  leading to the destruction of the very conditions of life on our planet.That is why  according to the outlook of President Nicolae Ceausescu  the fundamental problem of our time is that of changing the dangerous course of events  which is no* heading towards a nuclear catastrophe  in the direction of a new policy of detente  disarmament  collaboration and peace in the world.Although one would have expected that  in the year proclaimed by the United Nations as the International Year of Peace  concrete measure would be taken in order to revert from a policy of confrontation to a policy of solving the major problems facing mankind through negotiations  unfortunately we are witnessing the intensification of tension in world relations.Under the present international circumstances  Romania and its President consider it imperative to pass from mere pronouncements to deeds and to do everything to step up the efforts of the United Nations  in conjunction with those of all peoples and peace-loving forces  in order to ensure the adoption of tangible  real actions and agreements for the halting of the arms race and for disarmament on earth and in space.Only such a policy is liable to ensure real security for all States  to guarantee that peoples enjoy the proper conditions for creating new material and spiritual values  so that they can continue making their contribution to the progress and civilization of all mankind. That is why we consider it the sacred right and duty of every State large  medium or small  to act in a constructive spirit of co-operation and to contribute effectively to the radical improvement of the international climate.In this spirit  Romania and President Nieoiae Ceausescu are promoting an ample policy of dialog in international relations and taking part in world activity as a whole  toward finding solutions to the complex problems of our epoch  in the interest of co-operation and peace.Romania has worked and continues to work consistently to base its relations with all States on the principles of full equality of rights  respect for national independence and sovereignty  non-interference in internal affairs  mutual advantage  complete renunciation of force and the threat of force  and to affirm widely these principles in the international arena.Life itself  and the prevailing realities  have demonstrated the urgent need for these principles to be unanimously recognized and implemented as they represent the sole solid foundation for relations of collaboration and peace among all States.It is an axiomatic truth that the strategy of peace cannot be separated from the strategy of the future. Mankind yearns for a future of progress and prosperity  safe from the danger of nuclear weapons  indeed of any weapons.That is why Romania places the problems of peace and disarmament at the center of its external policy  starting from the conviction that its economic and social development plans - indeed  like the progress of all peoples - can be achieved successfully only under conditions of peace and collaboration with all States of the world.Working firmly in concert with all peace-loving forces in order to help reach appropriate agreements at an early stage  on the halting of the arms race and the adoption of tangible disarmament measures  Romania declares itself in support of the implementation of a complex disarmament program  centered on nuclear disarmament  leading to the phased liquidation of all nuclear weapons by the end ofthis century and  in parallel  for a 25 per cent reduction of conventional weapons in the next five years  as well as of troops and military expenditures  to be followed by further efforts in order to reach a reduction of at least 50 per cent by the year 2000.The adoption by this session of the United Nations General Assembly of the decision to proceed effectively toward the preparation of the third special session on disarmament  designed to adopt a global disarmament program  would represent without any doubt an important step forward  in conformity with the interests of peace of the entire international community.Romania considers that it would be of the utmost significance if a number of States were to unilaterally reduce their troops  weapons and military expenditures  in this respect. President Nicolae Ceausescu recently called on all States in Europe to reduce  by at least 5 per cent  their weapons  troops and military expenditures  even before an appropriate agreement is readied.As far as Romania is concerned  it is ready to proceed to a 5 per cent reduction of its arms  troops and military expenditures by the end of this year. If an agreement with other States to proceed together to surfs a reduction is not reached  this proposal will be submitted  in a referendum  to the will of the people  to decide on this unilateral reduction. We express our hope that other countries will show their willingness to go along with us in implementing this measure.It is Romania's steadfast conviction that the adoption by European States of measures toward the unilateral reduction of troops  weapons and military expenditures would pose no danger whatsoever to the security of any State. On the contrary  such measures will open the way to serious negotiations  as they will express the will of European States to act for disarmament and peace. This would be fully consonant with the demands of European and world public opinion.According to our conception  the huge human  material  financial and scientific resources being wasted each year to produce deadly weapons must be used to accelerate economic and social progress. With this aim in view  Romania has initiated  within the United Nations framework  a process aimed at determining the principles called upon to govern the activities of States in negotiating measures to freeze and reduce military expenditures. Finalizing and adopting the principles in question in their entirety  as of this session  would give new impetus to international activities aimed at bringing about a freeze and reduction of military budgets.In the light of these considerations  Romania believes that the bodies and conferences dealing with disarmament questions must  more than ever before  step up their activities; indeed  all negotiating forums must be used with maximum efficiency so that they may proceed without delay to the preparation and adoption of appropriate agreements and understandings  with the participation and in the interest of all States.In this respect  Romania has made its contribution to the conclusion  following appropriate agreements of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe.We appreciate the fact that at the Vienna negotiations on the reduction of armaments and armed forces in Central Europe  the two sides will be able to reach an agreement at an early date. At the same time  we declare ourselves in favor of the achievement of adequate agreements at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. To this end  the successful conclusion of negotiations designed to bring about an international agreement on the prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons  would be of special importance. The urgency of this matter should once again be stressed by the General Assembly.The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions of the con tin cm t would greatly contribute to military disengagement  to building up confidence and security in Europe. In that spirit  Romania has taken a position and acted consistently to promote the development of confidence and co-operation among all Balkan coin tries and to help turn that region into a zone free of nuclear and chemical weapons and foreign military bases. Similarly  we support the establishment of zones free of nuclear and chemical weapons in the northern and central parts of Europe  as well as em other continents.The whole evolution of international life indicates once again that there can be no justification for continuing the arms race  especially the nuclear arms race  for increasing military expenditures  which have by now soared to the huge amount of 31 000 billion.That is why our country welcomes and fully supports the program of nuclear disarmament advanced by the Soviet Union in three stages  to be carried out by the year 2000  and declares itself in favor of the immediate cessation of nuclear tests and for the prevention of the militarization of outer space.Welcoming the USSR decision on the extension of the unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests  Romania and President Nicolae Ceausescu on this occasion too  renew  their appeal to the United States of America and to all other nuclear-weapon States to put an end to such tests as soon as possible.At the same time  Romania considers that a series of proposals put forward by the United States of America and other States represent a real basis for reaching disarmament agreements. In our view  the time has come for the other nuclear-weapon States to participate in nuclear arms talks  even if they proceed to their own arms cuts only after the United States of America and the USSlt carry out a substantive reduction cf their nuclear weaponry. Similarly  we believe that the European States  as well as the other States of the world  are directly interested and should take an active part in achieving agreements on the cessation of nuclear tests  nuclear arms reductions and halting the militarization of outer space.An especially dangerous situation has arisen in Europe  where new nuclear weapons have been and continue to be deployed  thus endangering the existence of every nation and international peace. In view of this  Romania declares its support for the early achievement of agreements on cessation of the deployment of new intermediate-range nuclear missiles on the European continent and the destruction of existing ones  and on the elimination of all chemical weapons.My country firmly declares its opposition to measures designed to bring about the militarization of outer space and supports the use of outer space by all nations for peaceful purposes only. In this connection  we support the idea of convening a world conference on the question of the peaceful uses of outer space to work out a global program for the use of outer space and space technology to further the economic and social development of all countries  particularly the developing countries  to adopt a treaty in this field and to set up a special United Nations body dealing with outer space.In order to improve the international political climate  strengthen confidence and security and revive the process of detente  everything possible must be done to stop all military conflicts and solve all outstanding issues solely by peaceful means  through direct negotiations between the countries concerned and by making use of international organizations. Experience and reality demonstrate that  however tedious it may be  the path of negotiation is the only one capable of leading to viable solutions in the interests of the peoples and of peace. It must be well understood that any other means - such as force or interference in the internal affairs of States - is incompatible with the interests of peoples and with their aspirations to freedom and independence. That is why we must firmly oppose any form of terrorism  which has always been contrary to the interests of the peoples.We attach special importance to the implementation of provisions contained in the very timely solemn appeal for the cessation of all existing military conflicts  proposed by Romania and adopted by consensus at the fortieth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.Romania is deeply concerned about the situation in the Middle East. In the spirit of the initiatives undertaken by the President of Romania as early as 1978  we resolutely declare our support for the convening of an international conference sponsored by the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel  the Soviet Union and the United States of America  the other permanent members of the Security Council and any other States that could contribute constructively to the settlement of the situation in that region. We appreciate that a just and lasting peace in the region must be based on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territories occupied in the 1967 war  recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establish a Palestinian State and guarantees of the independence and sovereignty of all States in the region.We consider it necessary to do everything possible to put an early end to the war between Iran and Iraq  which is causing both peoples immense human and materiallosses. All military hostilities should be renounced and negotiations initiated with the aim of settling all outstanding issues between the two countries  in a spirit of full equality and mutual respect for independence and sovereignty.We strongly condemn the oouth African authorities' racist policy of apartheid and the repressive measures taken bv them against the majority population in that country  as well as the acts of aggression perpetrated by South Africa against neighboring independent  sovereign States. We demand the cessation of all such actions prompted by the policy of apartheid. Romania resolutely supports the struggle of the Namibian people  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  for the independence of Namibia. In general  Romania actively supports the struggle for complete elimination of any form of colonialism and consolidation of the freedom end independence of all the peoples and nations of the world.We believe that issues of conflict in Central America must be solved through negotiation on the basis of the proposals put forward by the Contadora Group and with full respect for the right of every people in that region to free and independent development without outside interference of any kind.I should also like to reaffirm Romania's solidarity with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and our active support for its position  initiatives  efforts and political and diplomatic actions aimed at the peaceful  democratic and independent unification of the country.The elimination of underdevelopment  the bridging of the gaps between rich and poor countries and the establishment of a new international economic order are essential prerequisites for the peace and security of all peoples and the very future of mankind. It is well known that in past years the world economy hascontinued to be marked by instability and a series of negative phenomena engendered by the world economic crisis  which have an impact  to a greater or lesser extent  on all countries.The economic situation of the developing countries has been particularly affected. The overwhelming majority of those countries are being prevented from developing their economies and from advancing along the road of economic and social progress because of their external indebtedness and the high interest rates they are faced with  as well as tlr growing protectionism practiced in various forms by developed countries. There is an increasingly obvious tendency to block negotiations in all forums concerned with economic problems and to sidestep the framework provided by the United Nations for examining and solving those problems.Romania  as the Assembly knows  has already presented a series of proposals in this respect. My country is in favor of an international conference  to be convened under United Nations auspices and to be attended by all developing and developed countries participating on an equal footing  with a view to bringing about a global solution to the problems of underdevelopment  the establishment of a new international economic order and the achievement of co-operative relations based on understanding and equality.Such a conference should be conducive to an agreement and to understandings designed to facilitate faster progress for all countries  in particular those that are lagging behind. The objective here is to achieve the harmonious development of all States and of the world economy.Romania considers also that the problem of foreign debt requires a comprehensive solution involving the following elements: cancellation of the entire debt of the poorest countries  those with a per capita national income of $500 to $600} reduction by a sizable percentage of the debt of developing countries with a per capita national income of up to $1 000 or $1 200; general reduction by between 50 and 70 per cent of the debt of other developing countries  grouped by level of national income and by potential; rescheduling for a 15 to 20 year period of the remainder of the debt at 3 to 4 per cent interest  or with no interest at all  and with a grace period of three to five years; establishment of a ceiling for annual payments of foreign debt  not to exceed 10 per cent of the annual export earnings of the developing country in question; establishment of a maximum interest rate on old credits  not to exceed 3 to 4 per cent  with amounts paid in excess of that limit to be deducted from the volume of foreign debt; and provision of new credits to developing countries on favorable terms and conditions and with reasonable interest rates of a maximum of 5 per cent. To achieve such a global solution to the problem of the foreign debt  the United Nations must play an active part. In this respect  Romania holds the view that concrete action and measures must be taken within the United Nations framework to bring about the proper solutions.My country is in favor also of restructuring the international monetary and financial system  and of convening an international conference to that end. We consider that at this hour  when a major scientific and technological revolution is in full swing  more efforts should be made to ensure broad and unhampered access by developing countries to the achievements of modern science and technology and a substantial transfer of technology to those countries in keeping with their specific development needs. In this respect  Romania joins other countries in supporting the convening of a second United Nations conference on science and technology for development.On the occasion of the commemorative session of the General Assembly to mark the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  an assessment was made of the world Organization's activities and its role. This once again brought to the fore the need for the Organization faithfully to reflect international realities  to serve as a genuine forum for the entire international community  to fulfill the mission entrusted to it by the Charter and to serve more efficiently the cause of peace and progress  thus responding to the legitimate aspirations of peoples.Taking into account the complexity of the international situation  the persistence of old conflicts and the emergence of new ones  and the contribution the United Nations must make to the resolution of those conflicts  Romania has put forward during past sessions the proposal that a commission for good offices  mediation and conciliation be set up within the United Nations system. Such a commission is conceived as a mechanism permanently available to Member States for the peaceful settlement of their disputes. We consider that the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization should step up its examination and finalization of this proposal.To strengthen peace and co-operation with a view to improving the international political climate  it would be highly important and timely to buildan all-round international security system  an item that has been included on the agenda for this session. That system would be based on firm respect for the fundamental principles of relations among States  on the absolute exclusion of the use or threat of use or force  on the peaceful settlement of disputes  on the growth of the role of the United Nations in dealing with problems of peace and security and the democratization of international life. As part of the process of strengthening peace  security and co-operation among nations  it is particularly important to develop and consolidate good-neighborliness among States  a subject figuring on the agenda of the present session as a result of a Romanian initiative. We consider it necessary to proceed within the present institutional framework to the identification and clarification of the components of good-neighborliness with a view to drafting an international United Nations document in that field.Romania was a promoter of the United Nations International Youth Year: Participation  Development Peace  which was an event of deep significance for the present and future of the younger generation and which had a wide and profound response throughout the world. We consider that the problems of youth must be kept under the constant scrutiny of the United Nations  of all Member States and of other international organizations. We realize that the guidelines for future programs devoted to youth  which were adopted at the 1985 United Nations World Conference for the International Youth Year  must be implemented in order to unite young people the world over in an effort to protect and exercise their fundamental right to forge a free and worthy life for themselves in a world of peace and co-operation.Romania holds the view that the United Nations can and must play a vital role in the settlement of the major problems facing mankind  through the effective use of its capabilities. The financial difficulties confronting the Organization at present can and must be resolved through the improvement and simplification of the Organization's activities  without negatively affecting its democratic priorities and structures  based on the participation of all Member States in conditions of equality  and on the powers of the General Assembly as the most representative United Nations body.In the spirit of the foreign policy of Romania  my delegation will act firmly  by working together with the delegations of other States  to contribute to the constructive work of the present session of the General Assembly  so that the Assembly may adopt decisions which will open the prospect of real progress towards disarmament and the strengthening of confidence and security in the world.Having entrusted me with the task of putting before this Assembly Romania's position and proposals on the main items on the agenda of the Assembly for its forty-first session  the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania  Nicolae Ceausescu  ardently appeals that we join our efforts and act in a high spirit of responsibility for the destiny of our peoples and for the destiny of our planet  so that we may ensure the triumph of reason and the building of a world of peace  free of weapons and of wars."
"115",5950,"RUS",41,1986,"We all come in turn to this important rostrum to speak of our perception of the world  our combined efforts produce a picture of present day international realities.What is the picture that we see today? At first glance  the interval since the last session of the General Assembly has done nothing to brighten the panorama of our time. The intervening period has been marked by a number of factors which have aggravated existing concerns. The arms race has not been halted; it is advancing in a steep spiral. The danger of its spreading to outer space has become more real. Dangerous hotbeds of armed conflict persist. In many parts of the world  misery and poverty are becoming more acute.Despite all this  we still believe that the International Year of Peace will go down in history as something more than just a symbol of peace.I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to some trends which enable us to speak of glimmers of light on the world's horizon. They should be noted by everyone of us  for they should strengthen our resolve to act even more vigorously. They should be noted by all the peoples  who are tired of bearing the burden of fear and anxiety. They should be noted by the world as a whole  which is becoming an increasingly interdependent and indivisible whole  and which may no longer be able to withstand strain and destruction.Hope breeds optimism. In the words of Mikhail Gorbachev: ""Everywhere in the world there is a growing conviction in the minds of the peoples and in political public circles and widely differing in their orientation and outlook that what is at stake is the survival of mankind and that the time has come for decisive and responsible action."" Wfe see a glimmer of light in the fact that at a time so crucial for mankind the peoples of the world  and an increasing number of Governments  are becoming aware of the need to adopt a new way of thinking in line with the realities of the nuclear and space age.The time is at hand when considerations of groups  blocs or ideologies are beginning to give way to the understanding that peace is the supreme value. Only if peace is translated from declarations >a x> practical action is there a chance for survival. This new way of thinking is bringing that truth into the foreground. Whole groups of countries  the Non-Aligned Movement  political parties  public organizations and anti-nuclear forces are putting forward promising ideas for ending the nuclear deadlock. A favorable background is emerging fordeveloping a dialog.An exception to this trend is the policy pursued by the imperialist forces. This contrast  however  only emphasizes the general will for action  for concrete practical deeds.It is becoming a fact of life that vast territories are being declared nuclear-weapon-free zones. Democratic majorities are taking such decisions throughdemocratic procedures.Political leaders who claim that they are committed to democracy  shouldbecome aware of the contradictions between their behavior and their declared principles. Instead of building up and counting warheads  they should be counting the votes of these who call for the complete elimination of weapons of mass destruction.Unfortunately  in some countries the institutions of democracy are being outweighed by the immoral arithmetic of military superiority. But it is an indisputable fact that the call for action is no longer a voice crying in the wilderness. On the contrary  even in the wilderness of the Nevada desert calls are being heard for an end to nuclear testing. The Nevada explosions are new registered not only by us but also by United States scientists with their instruments installed near the Soviet city of Semipalatinsk.At the same time  not a single seismograph in the world is registering nuclear explosions on our territory - not because of any lack of sensitivity on the part of the instruments  but because the Soviet Union is responsive to the will of the world community.In pursuing the foreign policy proclaimed at the Twenty-seventh Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  our co lei try is taking specific  practical steps. One of the most important is the unilateral moratorium on nuclear explosions. This is precisely the kind of action that proves the sincerity of our intentions and the seriousness of our concern for the future of the world.For more than a year now the Soviet testing sites have remained silent. Listen to this silence? it is very eloquent. If it were accompanied by a similar silence at United States test sites  that more than any words would tell mankind that what we are witnessing was the beginning of a movement towards realizing theidea of a nuclear-free world.Stopping the tests means not allowing the emergence of new types of nuclearweapons and barring the way to the creation of nuclear space weapons. We call uponthe United States to join us in this forward march and not call us back to carryingout explosions  as it proposed here yesterday. A bilateral moratorium  followed bya multilateral one  is one of the most important links in the chain of actionswhich could lead to the creation of a comprehensive system of international peace and security.In its determination to make this a reality  the Soviet Union  together with other socialist countries  has submitted proposals on this subject for the Assembly's consideration. We are convinced that the creation of this system that would embrace the political  military  economic and humanitarian fields would be inkeeping with the interests of all States and peoples.The sponsors of this proposal make no claim to have discovered a hitherto unknown political ""continent"". If there are any blank spots today they exist mainly in the field of concrete  practical measures. To clear the way for such action would indeed be a discovery of the highest order. The proposed bases for security are consonant with the principles of the United Nations Charter and designed to promote their implementation within the specific conditions of our day. Here  we are looking forward to a most democratic and constructive discussion and the collective creative efforts of all countries.The idea of comprehensive security presupposes first and foremost material guarantees of peace  political and international legal safeguards and the establishment of principles of civilized and respectful relations among States. A safe world is a world of law and order  in which there is strict compliance with the united Nations Charter and respect for all rules of international law  for human rights and freedoms.Our initiative contains an answer to the question of what should be done to save life on Earth. As we speak of this the abandoned villages in the area of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant stand before our eyes. That accident has meant for us more than grief over our losses and compassion for its victims. It has reinforced our anxiety for the future of the Earth. Chernobyl was a tragic mistake on the part of human beings working with the peaceful atom. But still less are there any guarantees against mistakes with the military uses of the atom. Given the existence in the world of 50 000 nuclear warheads  we are living on borrowed time and no one knows when that time will run out.What should be done? Continue to play the game of nuclear roulette? It isclear even now that  sooner or later  this could lead us to collective suicide andself-destruction. There is only one way out: before it is too late  while thereis still time  the game played for insane stakes and in which there can be nowinner must be stopped. Stop once and for all this deadly gambling with nuclear death.It is within the powers of the international community  the sole sovereign master of its own fate to do this. No single nuclear Power has the right to take decisions on behalf of all  and the USSR refuses to do so. In his historic statement of 15 January  the Soviet leader proposed something quite different - to scrap all nuclear weapons. Once again the criterion is experience.Political responsibility is the opposite of political arrogance. The problem of nuclear testing clearly highlights these mutually incompatible approaches.There are other facts. Look at the fate of the SALT I and SALT II treaties. They are being torn up now because they allow no room for equipping a 131st bomber with cruise missiles. One thousand  five hundred such missiles seemed too few  soit was necessary to add 20 more.The tribunal of history is merciless in its verdicts. If political leaders fail to take timely and responsible decisions  history will not forgive them. We have a chance to lay the foundations for lasting peace. Of course it is not just a matter of adopting yet another resolution. The United Nations must establish a system of values which gives the highest priority to practical actions.Let ma emphasize that this is being stated by the representative of a nuclear Power. We never wanted to acquire nuclear weapons  but from the time we were forced to acquire them we have constantly sought to limit  reduce and eliminate them. We are not the last member of the ""nuclear club""  but we are proposing its dissolution. Let there be no mistake - we have our pride like anyone else. However  the prestige and dignity of a great Power are things we associate with theequal security of all.We are motivated by our sense of responsibility both to our own people and to other peoples. It is for this reason precisely that we are willing to agree to sensible compromises and make realistic concessions when we put forward proposals for the reduction of strategic offensive weapons and medium-range missiles. This reflects the new approach to the realities of the nuclear space age outlined most fully and comprehensively in Mikhail Gorbachev's report to the Twenty-Seventh Congress of our Party.The sincerity of our intentions and the integrity of our position are matched by our determination to put an end to the dangerous course of world events. We are putting so much emphasis on the renunciation of nuclear-weapon tests because it is precisely this that is the real test of the sincerity of declarations.Yesterday we heard the statement of the President of the United States. It is regrettable that the rostrum of the General Assembly was used in such a way. To respond point by point to that statement presents no problem. However  to enter into polemics would be to show a lack of respect for our audience. The subject under discussion is far too serious to turn it into a grindstone for sharpening political wit. Time is too precious to be wasted on refuting misconceptions and prejudices that distort reality and facts.Nevertheless  there is one key point to which we must refer  because it is of fundamental importance. I am referring to the attempt to provide a philosophical rationale for the assertion that new sophisticated military technology is capable of reliably ensuring security. It is precisely that kind of philosophy that caused the tidal wave of armaments which has been growing year after year and now threatens to obliterate the Earth.There is only one path to security - destroying existing weapons instead of replacing them with new ones. The technology of destruction must not be allowed to determine policy.One can imagine the sigh of relief among people if they heard that in this International Year of Peace the United States  too  had decided to stop nuclear testing. That is what they had been expecting from the United States President I have been authorized to state that the Soviet Union is ready  at any time and anywhere  to sign a treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. We are ready to do so here at the United Nations  so that the entire world community could become part of this great act and historical turning-point which would be a sign of respect for its will.Words not matched by deeds are worthless  but words supported by deeds are a country's gold reserve.We urge those who make verbal pronouncements in favor of eliminating nuclear weapons to follow up with practical deeds. Otherwise whatever they say about the inhumanity of nuclear weapons is no more than a rhetorical mirage behind which there looms an altogether different policy.Its proponents iWe a favorite argument  verification. But that argumentincreasingly resembles a tattered curtain. Broadly speaking  there is no longerany problem of verification. In the conviction that there can be no trust withoutverification  the Soviet Union is open to any form or method of verification.In our view the summit conference of the non-aligned countries at Harare made some very valuable recommendations in this respect. The United Nations could support the proposals of the Delhi Six - Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Tanzania and Sweden - on monitoring compliance with the obligation not to carry out nuclear tests. The Soviet Union will accept recommendations formulated under the auspices of the United Nations.We agree with those States which believe that the question whether mankind will live in a nuclear or a nuclear-free world must be decided by the whole world community and not by a small group of nuclear Powers.This also applies fully to the future of outer space  for near-Earth space is the common heritage of mankind and should be used for the benefit of all. However  if weapons gat into space  this heritage would become a threat to all? just two or three States enjoying the status of military-space Powers would then dominate the rest of the world.Is that what we want? Do we want a military-space fiefdom to be established? The question is posed by the course of events  which may become tragic forinternational relations as a whole. Therefore we shall continue to work to protect outer space from attempts to turn it into a military domain of one or two Powers.Today those designs are being camouflaged with high-sounding pronouncements about a defense program  which supposedly would do away with the threat of attack once and for all. One hears moving and soul-stirring stories about a dream which when realized would free mankind from the fear of nuclear death. Evil designs are being purveyed as good intentions  and swords as shields.Let no one be misled by such talk. It serves to conceal an attack against the main pillar of stability  the anti-ball is tic-missile Treaty. The intention is to get the Treaty out of the way within a time frame of seven years. Here everything is being very carefully calculated  for it is precisely in seven years that they plan to prepare space weapons for deployment.The question is. What for? Would it not be more sensible to work for an agreement on the complete elimination of nuclear missiles  whether strategic  medium-range or any other  as we are proposing?The answer is simple; whatever is done to disguise it  the so-called defensive space shield is being designed to carry out a first strike with impunity. The first strike could become the last one  and not just for the country being attacked. Space weapons  like nuclear arms  do not recognize national boundaries  and they do not choose whom to spare and whom to destroy. And in any circumstances they could threaten  not one country or several countries  but the entire world.Therefore we consider it necessary to warn everybody that if space is to remain peaceful everyone must protect it.In this  the United Nations  the only legitimate trustee of peace in outer space  should make its voice heard.We also call for the help of the United Nations in regard to a matter of extreme importance - the elimination of chemical weapons. Encouraging progress has been achieved at the Geneva Conference.The historic goal of ridding the earth of chemical weapons is new closer to attainment. The only thing that could hinder the attainment of that goal is the position of the United states  which is seeking to develop binary weapons. However  obstacles can be removed if political will is evinced - and this Organization is quite capable of stimulating it.A comprehensive system of international security has more than nuclear  space or chemical parameters. Security implies the non-use of any force  including conventional armaments and armed forces.The Soviet Union calls for a significant reduction in the level of military confrontation  above all between politico-military alliances. Radical proposals to that effect  based on the concept of reasonable sufficiency  have been made by the States members of the Warsaw Treaty.I shall say even more. We would certainly not want our troops to be present anywhere beyond our national borders. This question is also open for discussion and can be resolved in an atmosphere of increased trust and with the implementation of measures of military detente.A beginning has already been made in the Stockholm forum  and all of us - not just the Europeans - can congratulate ourselves and each other on this triumph of reason and good will. It has given us something more than just a major agreement. It has demonstrated that when we really want something  we can achieve it. It has confirmed that the Helsinki process is being successfully developed and has taken deep roots in European soil. It is now extremely important that the forthcoming meeting in Vienna should become yet another milestone in Europe's advance towards reliable security and improved co-operation.The Asian and Pacific region should also be allowed to breathe freely. Our ideas in this regard are incorporated in a concrete program of action that was outlined in Mikhail Gorbachev's address in Vladivosfaock. We are encouraged that this program has proved to be in harmony with the feelings of many States of the region.We are aware of all the sore spots existing in the region. First of all  there is the Korean peninsula. The people of Korea yearn for an aid to the division of their country. There is only one impediment to that  namely the presence of United States troops  which in effect occupy the southern part of the country.The situation around Kampuchea is another source of tension. Here again the fate of the entire people is being sacrificed to the geopolitical interests of certain States. To serve those interests  some are trying; to consign to oblivion the millions of human lives destroyed by the reactionary anti-national clique. This must not be allowed to happen.The constructive proposals of Kampuchea  Laos and Viet Nam open the way for resolving the region's problems on a broad political basis and stabilizing the situation in South-Bast Asia.Untying those and many other knots would undoubtedly contribute to the strengthening of peace and security in the Asian and Pacific region  and we are doing our best to promote this.The positive changes new under way in our country's relations with the People's Republic of China are important not only in terms of bilateral co-operation; they are also conducive to the improvement of the overall situation.New and increasingly rich substance is being added to our traditional friendly relations with the people of India and its Government. The Soviet Union values good relations with many Asian States and wishes to discuss with them  in particular with the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  ways of upgrading relations where they are as yet below the desired level.Measures to eliminate regional conflicts would form an organic part of the concept of comprehensive security. Of course  there is not  nor can there be  a uniform model for a political settlement here. Nevertheless  concrete expression must be given to some general principles. Those are  first  unconditional respect for sovereignty  independence and the right of nations themselves to choose their way of development; secondly  a respectful attitude towards legitimate Governments; thirdly  respect for the obligations and agreements concluded between States in full conformity with international law.Every regional conflict is a difficult test for the United Nations This is particularly true with regard to those territories where the emblem of the United Nations symbolizes special responsibility. Unfortunately  it is all too often darkened by the shadow of unfulfilled hopes.The time has long since come to put to effective use all the powers of this Organization  to exercise all its rights. This applies above all to the fate of the Namibian people and to the Trust Territory of Micronesia. Their problems are as old as the United Nations.The Middle East problem is somewhat ""younger"". There must not be many people present in this Hall who participated in the adoption of the resolution on the division of Palestine. Today  we are once again voicing our view that along with the State of Israel  which owes its existence to  among others  the Soviet Union  an Arab Palestinian State should become part of the world's political map.We believe that the United Nations should again take the matter of a Middle East settlement into its hands. As a practical step in that direction  the Soviet Union proposes that a preparatory committee be set up within the framework of the Security Council to do the necessary work for convening an international conference on the Middle East.The tragedy of the people of Cyprus has been going on for so many years now. Here as well there has been no lack of mediation efforts and plans for a settlement. Various options have been tried  but the proposal that the problem of Cyprus be settled at a representative international conference under the auspices of the United Nations has been studiously evaded. Who stands to gain from that? Only those forces which intend to use the island for their military and political plans. Raising the stick of ""neo-globalism"" over the Mediterranean  they would like to turn the entire region into a hotbed of tension. They sometimes use that stick without giving any thought to the consequences  as was done with barbaric cruelty in Libya.Since the very beginning of the war between Iraq and Iran  the Soviet Union has been calling for a stop to that senseless mutual extermination. Being sincere friends of both nations  we are making use of the possibilities available to us to convince the parties to the conflict that they should make peace. We shall continue to do so.It is our conviction that were it not for the racist regime of Pretoria the black  white and colored people in South Africa would have long ago found a common language - a language of equality  concord and racial peace. The dividing line is drawn not by ethnic differences but by the cruel policy of apartheid  which is hostile to everyone  irrespective of the color of the skin. To fail to see that is to encourage  wittingly or unwittingly  genocide against the majority of the South African people.The world community has just spoken out unequivocally about the situation in southern Africa  and it is up to the Security Council now to adopt binding decisions  embodying in them the will of the absolute majority of the world's nations.Recently  a new and ugly phenomenon of ""prepaid"" regional conflicts has appeared in international practice. A graphic example is Nicaragua  into which millions of dollars are being channeled to finance the massacre of peasants and the destruction of villages and plantations - only because that small country has dared to choose its own way of development which  in the eyes of the administration of the world's largest and most powerful capitalist nation  appears to pose a threat to its security.The undeclared wars against the legitimate Governments of Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Angola  Mozambique and Ethiopia are paid for in exactly the same way. And quite often the country financing a conflict maintains diplomatic relations or conducts negotiations with the Government concerned  while at the same time seeking to overthrow it by any means. Indeed  it does not mind the cost when blacklisting Governments and countries which  for some reason or other  it finds inconvenient. Thus  the entire range of reprisals  from direct military to economic and ideological  has been used against the Republic of Cuba for more than a quarter of a century. But surely it is high time to understand that such a policy is bankrupt and that it can only be described as insane.Political wisdom dictates acknowledging the established realities and not seeking to undo them arbitrarily. Describing gangs of mercenaries as ""freedom fighters"" - which is attempted in the war against Afghanistan - does not help. The time has come to learn to call things by their own names. With regard to Afghanistan  a national democratic revolution has taken place there. Its social base is constantly becoming broader and stronger; it relies on the support and participation of all social strata and ethnic groups in that country without any exception. They have a clear-cut program for a peaceful settlement of crisis phenomena  and all that is needed is not to hamper that positive process. Here again  the Soviet Union is in favor of seeking new solutions and a fresh approach  unobscured by prejudice  that would help to identify ways of solving the problem with due regard for the legitimate interests of the Afghan people and of its friends and neighbors.A comprehensive system of international security can give us the keys to many of the most intricate locks.We have outlawed  as most other States have  any form of terrorism. At the same time  we are prepared to contribute  and are already contributing  to fighting that plague. No sane person can live with it. Terrorism must be mercilessly eradicated  for innocent people suffer and die because of it. But to combat it effectively we also should see its causes. One should not ignore the nature of that abhorrent phenomenon: outbursts of individual and group terror are sometimes engendered by imperialist violence against entire peoples. An improvement in the overall international situation would do much to help stamp out terrorism.An obstacle to an improved international climate is posed by neo-globalism. It entails diktat and aggression; it tramples upon the independence of nations. The alternative to it is a comprehensive system of security.The arms race and regional conflicts inevitably have an adverse effect on the world economic system. And while politicians  futurologists and experts are trying somehow to model a structure of security in a world with or without weapons  no one can come even close to predicting the economic consequences of the situation as it evolves. Yet the explosion with which it is fraught would be no less catastrophic than a possible malfunction in the technologies of war.Today  militarism is not only jeopardizing man's physical survival but his socio-economic progress as well. The cost of the arms race is reaching a level comparable to the material damage caused by past world wars. All of this makes disarmament imperative.Against the background of the uncontrollable crisis affecting the world economic structure we see with particular clarity the increasingly prevalent process of purging out resources from the national economies of the developing countries of Latin America  Africa and other regions. In the early 1980s the developing world  exploited by imperialism  was pushed into a vicious circle of development via debt  and it now finds itself hung up in the noose of a trillion dollar indebtedness. This  in effect  means that regions with the world's greatest concentration of population  resources and future markets are sliding towards economic catastrophe.That is why we regard economic security as an integral part of a comprehensive system of international security. When it begins to function  it will be possible to set up a fund for assistance to the developing countries and to draw up  under United Nations auspices  a global program of scientific and technological co-operation.In our opinion  a comprehensive system of international security is inconceivable without wide-ranging and open co-operation in the humanitarian field. We are strongly in favor of expanded international co-operation in implementing political  social and individual human rights  and we urge everyone to take a fresh  unbiased look at that problem. Specifically  at the Bern meeting the Soviet Union proposed that steps be taken by all States bring their domestic legislation on the whole range of humanitarian problems into conformity with international norms. Unfortunately  another approach emerged at the Bern meeting  one that ignores the consensus among most of the participants in that dialog. Here  the United States of America undermined the adoption of any agreement.The path of detente is a path towards greater openness in societies  towards a better level of objective information  towards nations' mutual familiarization with each other's life and towards the strengthening of the spirit of mutual understanding and accord in their relations.Whatever the field of international relations we turn to  the role of the United Nations can be seen as indispensable and its responsibility as great  ""today  with the emergence of a new consolidation of the forces of progress and peace  the members of the Organization should have as their common concern the enhancement of United Nations authority and prestige and the increased effectiveness of its decisions. The dedicated work of Mr. Perez de Cuellar as Secretary-General of the United Nations at a difficult time for the Organization evokes deep respect  and we would like to thank him cordially.The United Nations is on the verge of serious changes. It is impossible to restructure relations among States without taking into account altered realities. The Organization could only gain were the country presiding as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to participate  in one form or another  in the work of the Security Council.Recent events have once again focused attention on an odd phenomenon  the country that once offered the site for United Nations Headquarters today all-too-often shows intense hostility towards the Organization. It slams the door and refuses to fulfill its obligations  as has been the case with the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)  or tries to assert the principle that whoever has the most money is right. It puts spokes in the wheels of the collective machinery with the notion that by so doing that machinery can be made to function according to its will. The United States has adopted the practiceof lecturing  punishing and arbitrarily threatening the Organization as a whole and those of its members it dislikes for some reason. Lately  the States Members of the United Nations have begun to ask with increasing frequency whether the United Nations can function normally in a country whose Government shows such undisguised disrespect for them and for the Organization itself. Perhaps that question should be heeded. It might be useful to hold a special debate in the United Nations on the numerous accumulated problems of the operation of the Organization.The Organization's universality implies a forward thrust towards rapprochement and towards the elimination of centrifugal forces. In light of the proposed concept of comprehensive security  the East-West  North-South polarities can and must be expunged from the political vocabulary. That is what socialism is calling for. Whatever its antagonists assert  socialism is opposed to confrontation and intransigence in the most important pursuit of mankind: the construction of a durable and guaranteed peace. We have adopted that system of priorities in our relationship with the United States as well. This question has already been addressed here yesterday. Let me say that we are far from regarding our relations with the United States as holding no promise particularly since we have a high regard for the American people. Lately  encouraging outlines of meaningful agreements have been emerging. A summit meeting is also a realistic possibility. We could move forward fairly smoothly  if that is what the United States side wants. We are realists  and we do not draw inspiration from Utopian ideas. At the end of the last century  people envisioned the coming twentieth century as a golden age. But reality has dashed those expectations. Today  on the threshold of the twenty-first century  the objective reality is such that it could become either the golden age of science or the age of nuclear permafrost. The material means for bringing about either outcome already exist. The question is  which of them will be put to use?The danger for civilization is ail-too evident. Hence the need for responsible  concerted action to prevent any possible catastrophe. We have made our choice. The Soviet Union - and I quote the words of Mikhail Gorbachev - will ""continue to use every opportunity for productive dialog  for progress towards arms limitation and reduction  as well as towards the settlement of regional conflicts and the development of international co-operation in all areas of importance.""We think that in our deliberations it is very important that we never lose sight of the real scale of time and of the world. The language of which some politicians are so fond obscures that scale in a fog of nebulous abstract concepts  as if what is involved were not the Earth  but some other  remote  planet. Yet it is the Earth that we see before us in the images of our children and grandchildren  our fathers and mothers  our sisters and brothers  all those who are close and dear to us and with whom each of us identifies the concepts of ""nation "" ""country"" and ""mankind.""This is the only acceptable yardstick. And one should not adjust his political telescope as though his sole interest were whether there is  indeed  life on Mars. All of us must answer one question  a question that is equally important to all: whether there will be life on Earth. We would very much like to answer  with confidence: Yes  there will be!"
"116",5997,"RWA",41,1986," The General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 1986 as the International Year of Peace. In that context  the present session is working towards an objective which represents the very essence of the fundamental principles which prevailed at the creation of the Organization  whose vocation it is to work for the promotion and maintenance of peace  staving off war and any threat of war while promoting all efforts aimed at developing co-operation that would improve the fate of mankind.The States represented within this Assembly have committed themselves to an ideal inherent in those principles - an ideal that has led to a new dynamism in international relations and to which  at every session  those States pay solemn tribute  whilst reaffirming their commitment to act in concert to ensure that peace - the result of an order based on justice - may be constantly strengthened and consolidated.That commitment has as a corollary the need to engage in constructive dialog in order to put into effect the great purposes which  enshrined in the Charter  have made this Organization a meeting point of hopes shared by all peoples that love peace  that peace which is not merely the opposite of war but also an element of - indeed  a synonym for - progress and prosperity  to be promoted in a spirit of active solidarity and effective unison.In this respect  will 1986  the International Year of Peace  become a milestone in the overall evolution which should progressively bring the international community closer to the aims it wishes to achieve through concerted effort? The answer to that question remains open.In the economic sphere  the situation facing most countries is highly alarming. One cannot but deplore the fact that over the years the problems of development have acquired increasingly worrisome dimensions because of thecontinuing deterioration of the world economy and the persistent crisis that has kept the third world in a state of precarious survival.While the economies of the industrialized countries seem to be headed towards resumed growth  the situation is quite different for their partners in the South: the gap is widening  emphasizing the imbalances under which the latter are suffering. This in itself would justify the demands calling for a new international economic order on a more just basis  governed by machinery which  combining the realities  interests and needs of all in a framework of true interdependence  would assure a balance capable of generating the impetus that would enable the third world to face the numerous challenges inherent in underdevelopment.The Republic of Rwanda is convinced that the North-South dialog is the most appropriate means to reverse the present trend and promote the positive evolution of international economic relations. To that end  our Organization must display persistence and a fertile and creative imagination in order effectively to assume its proper role that of actively contributing to a change in current relations so as to achieve the principles of solidarity and complementarity set out in the Charter.In this context  the delegation of Rwanda reaffirms the need to intensify international co-operation through an approach taking into consideration current needs so as to assure the best possible foundations for the process of development. The countries of the third world commit themselves in this regard to a meaningful contribution through the efforts they are deploying to promote and strengthen horizontal co-operation at their level.Rwanda attaches great importance to all initiatives and specific actions whereby the international community undertakes  at a South-South as well as North-south level  to build a better world for the benefit of all. in an over-all context  where the adverse impact of the international economic crisis strikes all countries in varying degrees  an entire continent - Africa - has been exposed to that crisis under particular conditions which have brought it virtually to the brink of disaster. Africa is still the continent where the problems of under-development assume their most heart-rending form. Africa contains the greatest number of countries classified by the United Nations as least developed - those which must face the most serious handicaps to development.Africa needs the active support of its partners to restore its economy. This calls for a firm commitment on the political level  good will and large financial investments. All these are elements through which the spirit of solidarity shown by its partners in regard to the continent must acquire the dimensions of a lasting and dynamic co-operation making it possible to establish a basis for development while at the same time supporting its own efforts  for which external assistance is indispensable.It is in this perspective that the special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations devoted to a consideration of the economic situation in Africa must be viewed. Held from 27 May to 1 June 1986 as the result of an appeal made by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  that session  which will constitute a landmark  led to the adoption of the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990.That session will constitute a landmark because it gave Africa a unique opportunity to engage in a dialog with its partners to open the way for more active solidarity on behalf of an entire continent which is seeking survival and which  having realistically and rigorously set out the most urgent conditions likely to guarantee the success of its efforts for economic recovery  will not yield to despair  despite the magnitude of the obstacles to its development  which is more than ever before a long-term task.Beyond the concerns linked to the condition of the world economy  on the political level and in the context of the International Year of Peace  the present session will have to reaffirm the fundamental principles on which security in the world must be built.Those principles constitute a code of ethics based on respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  respect for the right of all peoples to self-determination and the principle of the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. It is deplorable that the application of that code of ethics as an immutable rule of conduct is flawed by unacceptable exceptions  political crises and tension and even open conflicts  which are handicaps and obstacles to the achievement of the purposes set out in the Charter of the United Nations.Thanks to the perseverance of the United Nations/ the majority of colonial peoples have regained their freedom. Unfortunately  the decolonization process remains incomplete? many peoples still live under anachronistic domination. In this context  the Assembly  at the current session  must forcefully reaffirm that the legitimate aspiration of peoples to self-determination  independence and freedom must never be frustrated.In this connection it is of the utmost urgency for the international community to take collective action to impose the force of law in South Africa  Namibia  the Middle East and Western Sahara - indeed  wherever peace is still subjected to the vicissitudes of policies and practices that run counter to universal morality and legality.The situation in southern Africa is making that region a land filled with resentment  a powder-keg ready to explode. With indescribable arrogance the advocates of apartheid have taken their practice of that outdated doctrine to extremes  making it the ideological basis of a demonic system condemned by all. The Pretoria regime is notorious for the crimes it has committed in South Africa itself in order to perpetuate the most obnoxious racism. Abroad  it engages in endless delaying tactics to postpone Namibia's inevitable accession to independenceand steps up its acts of aggression  destabilization and intimidation against the front-line States  which it would like to bring to heel.Rwanda is more than ever convinced that it is its duty to fight that regime  which is a disgrace to mankind. This is the duty of all peoples that cherish freedom and justice and support the struggle to bring democracy to South Africa and independence to Namibia.On the specific question of Namibia  20 years after the United Nations decision to revoke South Africa's Mandate over that Territory  the International Conference on the Immediate Independence of Namibia  held in Vienna in July 1986  and the special session of the General Assembly held from 17 to 20 September this year have appropriately stressed the gravity of the problem and the urgent need for implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which is recognized as the sole acceptable basis for a final settlement that takes into account the legitimate  inalienable rights of the Namibian people.Rwanda reaffirms its solidarity not only with the peoples and states in southern Africa facing increasing danger as a result of the arrogance and expansionism of the Pretoria regime  but also with the Palestinian people  convinced that it would be foolish to try to promote a just and lasting peace in the Middle East without guaranteeing respect for the rights of that people in the spirit of the fundamental purposes and principles of the Organization and without withdrawal by the State of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied by force since 1967.The Government of Rwanda cannot compromise on the universal principle of the right of all peoples to self-determination. Therefore  to strengthen its efforts to establish a climate conducive to international peace and security  the United Nations must do everything it can to guarantee that peoples still under foreign domination secure the freedom they desire.Similarly  to retain its credibility the Organization must make a decisive contribution to the settlement of conflicts and tensions in various areas of the third world which have become the battlefield of greed and foreign interference.Previous speakers have stressed the serious risks incurred by raising the stakes in the arms race  given the specter of nuclear war that haunts us all. The very existence of mankind is at stake. To the extent that efforts to encourage detente also promote international peace and security  the resumption of the dialog between the two major world Powers gives cause for satisfaction and hope  as long as the good intentions claimed by both sides lead to concrete action which can strengthen the trust that must underlie their relations and be reflected throughout the international community.The Government of Rwanda is extremely interested in this important dialog  for we are convinced that disarmament is an aspect of development. Disarmament for development is a relatively new concept  but it is clearly grounded in logics in an age when the triumphs of science and technology have led to miraculous achievements  when few exploits appear beyond the reach of mankind's creativity  we can no longer tolerate the contrast between the poignant tragedy of the peoples of the third world  which face the worst sort of uncertainty about their future and even about their survival  and the scandal of the enormous financial  material and technological resources devoted to the production of weapons of mass extermination. In the context of this International Year of Peace  peace that should go hand in hand with justice and the equitable sharing of mankind's resources  our Organization should strengthen the awareness of the intrinsic relationship between security  well-being and prosperity  to which all peoples aspire as we approach the end of this century.The fate of divided nations is a matter of constant concern to our Organization. The Government of Rwanda seizes every possible opportunity to refer to that concern. It has done so regularly here  deploring the fact that one people  belonging to the same nation  heirs to the same culture and molded by the same history  should be artificially divided. Consequently  Rwanda appreciates the efforts to promote and consolidate the process of normalizing relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  being convinced that that process is a tangible factor within the framework of detente and hoping that it will continue in a realistic and pragmatic manner with due regard for the constant hope of the German people to be reunited.Similarly  Rwanda supports any initiatives which are directed through a constructive dialog  without external interference or pressure  towards the peaceful reunification of the Korean nation.Every session gives Member States a unique opportunity to make an act of faith by renewing their commitment to the ideals enshrined in the Charter. The Rwandese delegation today reaffirms its commitment  and expresses its great appreciation of the results achieved by our Organization in its efforts to build an international community which  by dealing successfully with military confrontations  political crises and tensions and the socio-economic challenges with which it is faced  will be able to translate into action the philosophy based on the grand design of promoting peace and progress for the benefit of all peoples.Because of its dedication to that great task  the Organization continues to be the ideal setting for the constructive exchange of ideas between partners inspired by the strong and ardent desire to make collective decisions about their common future. Rwanda hopes that that desire will always actively encourage the international community to promote the fundamental purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter.That hope is strengthened at the current session  Mr. President  by the fact that you have been chosen to guide our work. Your election is a well-deserved tribute to you personally  in recognition of your eminent qualities  enhanced by a wealth of extensive experience  and also a tribute to your country  Bangladesh  in recognition of its active role in the family of nations. In offering you my warmest and most sincere congratulations  I assure you that Rwanda  privileged to be at your side in the Bureau of the General Assembly will spare no effort to contribute to the success of this session.I would also like to express once more our great appreciation to your predecessor  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  for the way in which he guided our work throughout his presidency of the General Assembly at its fortieth session.I also wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar; the Government of Rwanda admires the dynamism and efficiency with which during his current term of office  now coming to an end  he has constantly ensured that the United Nations should at all times be fully committed to the process of solidarity which will be a decisive factor in determining the future of mankind.Rwanda  an active participant in that process and proud to belong to the great United Nations family  is always receptive to any proposal which is in accordance with the principles of the Charter and will enable our Organization to consolidate our existing achievements and to keep intact the ideal which it is dedicated to promoting."
"117",6042,"SAU",41,1986," I take pleasure at the outset of my statement in congratulating you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. The Assembly's decision to entrust that high responsibility to you reflects international appreciation of you personally and is an expression of the eminent international position that the People* s Republic of Bangladesh commands. I must not fail to mention the strong brotherly relations that exist between our two countries. We are certain that your wide experience  wisdom and ability will be of great assistance to the General Assembly in fulfilling its responsibilities in the best possible way.I also wish to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Mr. Jaime de PiniSs  President of the fortieth session  for the effective way he carried out his functions during his presidency. The wisdom and capability which characterized his direction of the proceedings of the previous session earned the gratitude and appreciation of the world community for both him and his friendly country  Spain.I must mention also the consistent efforts made by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in the field of international relations  and his role in connection with the many responsibilities of the United Nations  one result of which during the previous session  was the success of the arrangements for and the attainment of the objectives of the program for the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  which reminded the international community of the importance of the Organization and its effective role.The establishment of the United Nations was from the beginning an expression of the urgent desire and strong determination of the peoples of the world to avoid a repetition of the tragedies caused by the Second World War. That desire and determination reflected a deep and fundamental awareness of the importance of peaceand security and the need for them to prevail all over the world and for putting an end to all acts of violence and aggression  all military threats and all forms of interventionist!!  hegemonism and colonialism. Such considerations have linked the name of the United Nations with lofty concepts and noble values  making of it the meeting point of all expectations of and aspirations to peace and the rule of law  as well as the starting point for all efforts to replace disruption and war by understanding and solidarity.From the time that it was founded  when the late King Abdul-Aziz established the basis of his rule  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has adhered to the principle of international peace and made the establishment of a sound basis of justice in dealings between nations in the political  economic and social fields one of the objectives of its foreign policy. Consequently  Saudi Arabia was one of the original signatories of the San Francisco Charter  on the basis of which this international Organization was established. Ever since then its belief in the fundamental importance of the Organization and its basic principles and objectives has never wavered. That belief is further confirmed and strengthened by the fact that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  which adheres to the religion of Islam  plays an outstanding international role which stems from a foreign policy based on the conviction that the basic principles of the Organization and the lofty purposes and principles of its Charter embody a reaffirmation of the tenets of Islamic law which regulate inter-State relations. Thus the Kingdom has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment and adherence to the principles of the Charter and its noble objectives  which constitute a firm guarantee of the achievement of international peace and security and a sound basis for the establishment of normal  just and balanced relations between nations. In that context  His Majesty King Fahd bin Abdul-Aziz pointed out on one occasion that we in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia""work in the global field within the framework of the United Nations and its affiliates and agencies. We adhere to its Charter and support its efforts  and oppose any aberrant action aimed at weakening it and diminishing the rule of international law in order to replace it by the force of arms and coercion. Our actions have always reflected and continue to reflect our sense of belonging to an international community that is one family  irrespective of the diversity of its interests  and demonstrate our faith in a peace based on justice and righteousness.""Although the United Nations has been able to achieve many results in various fields  it is capable of achieving more and of redoubling its efforts in the interest of international peace and security to secure justice  and enable peoples to regain their usurped rights. It is also capable of providing safeguards and guarantees that would ensure respect for the resolutions it adopts and a commitment to implement them  as well as of overcoming the obstacles that face those resolutions. Such obstacles have become a real challenge  which Member States must face  if they want the Organization to be a real instrument for establishing the foundations of peace and the consolidation of the basis of justice that they seek.While current international relations are still strained by conflicts  disturbances and quarrels  while complex political problems are still not being solved and severe economic crises are still threatening peace and stability  it would be unfair to put the blame for all this upon the shoulders of the United Nations alone  because the success or failure of this international Organization is tied to the positions taken by Member States and the extent of their commitment to the implementation of its resolutions and the fulfillment of its principles and objectives  and to their efforts in discharging their obligations. One of the biggest challenges that the United Nations faces is undoubtedly that of the existence of a wide gulf between the commitments to the Charter and its objectives and the actual conduct of nations in their international relations  especially those nations that persist in aggression  usurpation  terrorism and discrimination  such as Israel and South Africa.A cursory glance at the current international situation shows that world political  economic and social problems  have not diminished but increased in depth and gravity. It also confirms that the role of the United Nations grows in importance as the possibilities and opportunities for interaction and co-operation between nations increase. If peace based on right and justice  not on a balance of terror  is the objective of this international Organization - and it is the only sure means of ensuring security and stability - the feeling of injustice among the peoples deprived of self-determination in Palestine  Afghanistan and Namibia is the most dangerous time bomb threatening the strength and cohesion of this Organization; indeed  it threatens the peace and security of the entire world.The problems that the Middle East is now experiencing and the complexities that emerge from these  are in reality and in the final analysis consequences of Zionist aggression against Palestine and a result of the cumulative effects of the problem of Palestine. The wars and political and military conflicts that the region has known over the past 39 years are but one of the consequences of the failure to solve the basic problem and of the Israeli aggression in the region. The continued Israeli occupation of Arab lands is living proof of Israel's expansionist intentions  its blatant defiance of the resolutions of the United Nations and its consistent contempt for world public opinion and every law and convention. The tragic situation in Lebanon is one of the grave consequences of this problem. It is clear from all I have said that the establishment of peace in our region cannot be achieved without the solution of the main problem  the problem of Palestine  and that can be achieved only through recognition of the legitimate and inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. Israel's defiance and its persistent attempts to frustrate peace efforts in order to gain time to achieve its purposes and designs will only lead to more turmoil and to complications that will increase the difficulties involved in solving the problem  with all the dangers and perils that would entail.It is unnecessary to reaffirm the fact that no solution is likely to succeed if it does not include the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  as one of the elements of the quest and a party to the dialog. If peace is intended to be permanent then it must come from the area of the conflict and be based on justice  so that rights will be restored to their legitimate owners. The Arab countries have shouldered their historic responsibility and offered to do all they can for the sake of peace and stability in the region. They articulated their understanding of the peace process in the ""Fez resolutions""  which emphasized the Arab consensus on a peace based on justice  in accordance with international law and in concurrence with the international will represented by the resolutions of the United Nations.The war between Iraq and Iran  which we follow with grave concern and sadness  adds another dimension to the tense situation in the Middle East  over and above the bloodshed  destruction and devastation to which two brotherly peoples  who have the closest of links and the strongest of ties with each other as well as with us  are being exposed. This destructive war  which serves no purposes and brings no benefit to either of the parties to the dispute  has threatened and continues to threaten the peace and security of the region and indeed the peace and security of the whole world. His Majesty Ring Fahd bin Abdul-Aziz has on numerous occasions expressed his grave concern at the continuation of the war between those two brotherly and neighboring countries. His Majesty's Government has also participated in all efforts to put an end to that war and to help Iraq and Iran reach a peaceful solution to their conflict  in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and in harmony with the spirit of Islamic brotherhood and good-neighborly relations. In this context. His Majesty's Government has supported the mediation efforts made by the States of the Gulf Co-operation Council  the Good Offices Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations  as represented by its Secretary-General. It has endeavored to mobilize international support for those mediation efforts  in the hope of ending that war.While we express full appreciation to Iraq for its responsiveness to the peace efforts  we sincerely hope that Iran also will respond to those efforts. We also hope that the United Nations  being responsible for international peace and security  will take the necessary measures and steps to ensure the implementation of the decisions it has already adopted in this respect  in order to put an end to this destructive war.The problem of Afghanistan and the continued Soviet military occupation of that country is one of the most serious problems facing the international community today and one which requires a quick and decisive solution. The Soviet presence in Afghanistan has entered its seventh year and the Afghan Mujahideen are still waging a fierce war in defense of their religion  their country and their rights. The Organization of the Islamic Conference has made extensive efforts to remove the manifestations of oppression and occupation that the Afghan people are being exposed to  in order to enable them to liberate their country and secure their rights to freedom and independence.The United Nations also has made appreciable efforts to solve this problem. While the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supports them  it reaffirms that any such efforts should take into consideration the right of the Afghan Mujahideen and their demands. While the Kingdom salutes the Mujahideen  it renders full support to the demands made by the Afghan people for the withdrawal of foreign troops from their land and the establishment of a government that is acceptable to them and can preserve their neutrality and beliefs. It also salutes the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for its noble humanitarian stand in shouldering the burden of more than three and a half million Afghan refugees on its soil and the heavy economic and social burden which that stand entails.What is taking place on the African continent falls within the purview of the main interests of the Arab world. Historic  cultural and geographic links unify the two sides and make their solidarity inevitable in the face of the common challenges embodied in colonialism  Zionism and racial discrimination.The valiant struggle of the black majority against the repugnant apartheid policies practiced by the Government of South Africa fills our hearts with the hope that that policy has collapsed and demonstrated its failure. The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has consistently supported the imposition of comprehensive sanctions against that racist Government in order to force it to implement the resolutions adopted by the United Nations. I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate the support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the imposition of economic sanctions against South Africa and for the refusal to establish any form of ties with the South African regime.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also reaffirms its complete support for the people of Namibia in their struggle for self-determination and independence  for the resolution adopted by the General Assembly at its special session on Namibia held here at United Nations Headquarters in September 1986 and for the resolutions of the eighth summit conference of the non-aligned countries held at Harare  Zimbabwe  earlier this month  as well as for the resolutions of the Organization of African Unity. The aim of all those resolutions is to put an end to racist practices and to the foreign occupation of Namibia.Economic problems today represent one of the most important obstacles to international reconciliation  which might otherwise have served as one of the most important reasons for co-operation between nations  for despite the indications of economic recovery in a number of the major industrialized countries  the world is still faced with a deterioration in the performance of international commerce  particularly in the trade of developing countries. The indications of limited recovery in some industrialized countries are weak and unbalanced and are not really helping to reactivate the demand for the basic raw materials exported by developing countries. Thus it becomes clear that unless this recovery is accompanied by definite measures to regain confidence in the international economic system  actual recovery will remain a dream hard to achieve or realize.Moreover  the global situation of the petroleum industry is still enveloped in obscurities and fluctuations  following a drop in prices which is having a negative effect on that industry and on the economies of petroleum-exporting countries and on their ability to resume their development  and to continue to transfer wealth to developing nations and provide the necessary liquidity to finance the process of development in those countries.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  being itself a developing country  recognizes from its own experience the extent of the difficulties that face the peoples of the developing countries in achieving the standard of living to which they aspire. The Kingdom believes it has responsibilities as a member of the international community  and through its concern to strengthen the ties of co-operation and solidarity between peoples  and its desire to participate effectively in solving the development problems which face most developing countries  took the initiative  when resources became available to it  of investing a substantial amount of those resources in supporting efforts designed to promote the developmental process in the least privileged countries. It has even made the fulfillment of its commitments in this respect a permanent policy.The obvious disparity between the countries of the world  in terms of the quantities and types of natural and material resources they possess  makes co-operation between developing and developed countries an urgent requirement. Moreover  this disparity should lead to the promotion of understanding between peoples  the encouragement of dialog  and the strengthening of solidarity between the nations of the world  rather than becoming a cause for preserving imbalances and widening the gap between rich and poor countries. In this context  the Kingdom is convinced of the need to realize the objective of comprehensive development  because that is the only way to achieve real growth for all the peoples of the world. To secure this aim  development assistance must continue and increase  which in turn requires concerted and sincere efforts to support the existing developmental institutions and establishments and to strengthen their resources and their ability to play a more effective and realistic role in addressing the requirements of this critical stage. Comprehensive development is of the essence  for without it we cannot expect a viable world of continuous growth  whose peoples exchange benefits and complement one another.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that it will only be possible to provide the financial resources required during this decade to bring about the requisite economic change and to achieve a reasonable rate of comprehensive development in the developing countries as a whole when the industrialized countries in both the Eastern and Western blocs begin to bear their full responsibility by providing the financial contributions to which they are committed in accordance with the strategy of international development and the objectives of official development assistance. It is no longer possible to accept the excuses that the industrialized nations advance  either in terms of the quantity and type of that assistance  or in terras of international responsibility regarding the economic difficulties that the developing countries are experiencing.We should like to take this opportunity to appeal to the industrialized countries not to waste the opportunity for them to establish s basis for useful co-operation with the developing countries. We call upon them to resume  without further delay  the serious dialog required to begin a new era of comprehensive international negotiations in a spirit of mutual confidence and sincere co-operation in the best interests of the international community. At the same time  we appeal for a continuation of the trend in the developing nations towards greater realism  objectivity  and flexibility. We reaffirm our full conviction that the difficulties obstructing our present efforts to revitalize international economic co-operation and to build a new international economic order based on justice  should not  under any circumstances  be a cause of despair. On the contrary  it should be an incentive for us to continue our efforts for the good of humanity. Finally  we must conclude by expressing the hope of our peoples - or rather the hope of all peace-loving peoples - for the success of the efforts aimed at defusing the threat posed by the weapons of war that fill the world  and our hopes for the limitation of such weapons. We all know that in a new world war victor and vanquished will suffer the same fate; both will be destroyed and modern civilization will be wiped out. So we hope that the countries most directly concerned with this matter will realize that their commitment in this respect is a historic responsibility  and that they will live up to it in accordance with the standards demanded by the United Nations Charter  which enshrines a principle of commitment and a means of action commensurate with the level of responsibility that we hope all will respect."
"118",6079,"SDN",41,1986,"I extend to you. Sir  my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. We would also like to thank the outgoing President for his contribution in presiding over the previous session.I address the Assembly today in the name of the Sudanese people  who suffered years of misery and hardship under the rule of a tyrant who imposed an oppressive internal policy and adopted a subservient foreign policy thus making the Sudan a source of sadness and gloom. Freedom of expression in the Sudan became taboo  freedom was non-existent and the individual citizen was under a state of siege  threatened with detention  murder and limb amputation all in the name of religion. This was a distortion of a religion which uniquely sets adequate means for preventing crime before punishment and considers social factors as a cause for leniency and mitigation. It is a religion with an all-embracing outlook that grants rights first and punishes transgressions second. Under that despotic regime  the Sudan continued to be a source of tragic news  due partly to acts of man and partly to natural disasters such as drought  desertification and famine.Today  I bring to this Assembly and to the international community good news from the Sudan. The drought is now over and the country is able once again to feed its people from its own resources. In the sphere of human endeavor  our people have  for the second time in one generation  risen to topple the tyranny of the despot in a popular movement of containment in which the people is uprising was complemented by the armed forces. This helped bring down tyranny without loss of life or property. A transitional civilian and military regime then came into power and ruled for one year on the basis of a national entente. At the end of that year there were free general elections throughout 90 per cent o£ the country. The absent vote of that 10 per cent was due to security reasons. A Government was returned with the support of 80 per cent of the members of the Constitutional Assembly and 90 per cent of the voters. It is a Government which draws support from the grassroots of the populace.The newly born democracy in the Sudan guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms  upholds the independence of the Judiciary  the rule of law and the freedom of religion. It has gone farther than the safeguarding of political rights and the freedom of expression and has striven to achieve ethnic and regional balance in the exercise of power  as well as regional economic balance  so that political democracy may go hand in hand with economic and social democracy.This new Sudan is aware of the fact that it does not exist in a vacuum. It is cognizant of its deep Islamic  Arab and African roots and its awareness of these facets of this adherence reconciles their demands with an openness to the experiences of humanity and its intellectual  political  social  economic and technological achievements. Sudan  having completed the setting up of political institutions which will reflect its new orientation  has now launched a comprehensive national economic plan for the achievement of development with equitable social objectives. This new plan will put an end to the economic dependence to which my country fell victim  so that our economy may stand on our own indigenous capabilities. Our development plan will be an exercise in human engineering  aimed at saving the country from the accumulated shortcomings of the past years and ensuring a better more equitable life for our people.This commitment to democracy makes it imperative to resort to peaceful means in solving problems  avoid military adventurism and take up arms only in self-defense.Only dictatorships resort to military adventurism  as a means of diverting the attention of the people from their misery and seeking false glory. The democracies of free peoples are accountable for their actions and can propagate their ideals only through dialog and persuasion. The Sudan's experience has taught us that dictatorial regimes are a psychological burden that weighs heavily on their peoples since they impose deceitful and oppressive policies. They are also a political burden that entails degradation and oppression  an economic burden because they squander resources through ill-conceived expenditure  and a military burden because they lead to internal confrontation and external adventures. The Sudanese experience has also taught us that a political system based on freedom of choice and committed to the objectives of social balance and justice is indeed the most appropriate choice  the choice most in keeping with human dignity and the surest way to stability and the attainment of peace  both internally and externally.The new  promising Sudanese system  which has put an end to the flow of gloomy news and opened a new chapter of aspirations and hope  has galvanized the Sudanese people and given people everywhere cause for optimism   There are  none the less  hurdles in its path  and attempts are made to drag it back to a state of chaos and despotism. I shall highlight four of those hurdle"" because of their importance and because the international community has a crucial role to play in their removal.The first problem is desertification. Many human factors have contributed to the encroachment of the desert on my country. Ill-conceived agricultural and pastoral policies  deforestation  lack of adequate fire control in the rural areas  and failure in the area of the protection of the environment and vegetation. Conceptual and administrative shortcomings have combined with these naturalnational  regional and continental factors and caused desert encroachment of about 10 kilometers a year. In the Sudan  we give high priority to this problem and shall first undertake to increase the awareness of the people in this regard and put into effect sound and comprehensive plans to combat desertification and preserve our natural resources  which belong to both present and future generations.An integrated national  regional and international effort must be made to study the causes of desertification  plan its containment and provide the technical  financial and administrative means to combat it. In this regard  we commend the contribution of the United Nations and request that it be intensified and given the special priority it deserves so that man may not lose irreplaceable resources.Secondly  with regard to the refugee problem  Sudan has offered and continues to offer hospitality to the refugees who flee across its eastern  western and southern borders. Their numbers have increased enormously and now make up more than 10 per cent of Sudan's population. Such huge numbers put heavy burdens on Sudan's shoulders  some visible and quantifiable  others invisible and unidentifiable.Sudan is committed to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of its neighbors and would like to see the refugees return voluntarily to their home countries. To that end  Sudan will spare no effort to find ways and means of bringing about the national reconciliation which would ensure their voluntary repatriation. Pending the achievement of that objective  it is essential to control the presence of refugees in Sudan in such a way as to ensure their living conditions and security and provide them with the necessary educational and health facilities  while avoiding an adverse impact on the life and security of the Sudanese people. Planning requirements cannot be net and the financial  technical and administrative resources necessary for the achievement of those objectives cannot be provided from Sudan's resources alone. The international  community must join in  and any failure to do so will certainly obstruct the Sudanese endeavor.Our country has been visited by a United Nations inter-agency Mission representing many disciplines. The Mission has submitted a report the general thrust of which we support and welcome. We call for the intensification of efforts in the light of the contents of that report with a view to resolving the problems of refugees in the Sudan and supporting the Sudanese economy by eliminating the adverse effects of the presence of refugees  we appeal to the international community to make available the human and material resources necessary for the achievement of that objective. The third problem is that of external debt. That debt was incurred by an unconstitutional  illegitimate regime and now amounts to more than double our gross national product. The cost of its servicing is far greater than the total of our export earnings. In such a situation  is it reasonable to call upon Sudan to repay the loans that have matured when it has just emerged from a situation in which both morals and production were sabotaged in such a way that Sudan  a country that once enjoyed relative prosperity  was brought into disrepute and mendicancy?The first step that we shall take is to review the figures of that external debt so as to distinguish between what is legitimate and what is not returned loans will have to be dealt with  but not on the customary commercial basis. Our repayments will have to be within the limits imposed by the need to give priority to the livelihood of the Sudanese people and to provide a reasonable level of services for them and the level of development that the country requires. Those are priorities that no sane person can ask us to ignore. In the light of those priorities we shall allocate a certain percentage of our export earnings to meet part of our revised external debts.While we declare this commitment  we shall continue to appeal to the rich creditor countries to take account of the circumstances that led to the accumulation of debts  especially in Sudan  which lost much of its human and material resources during 16 years of havoc and repression. While it nay be our legal duty to remain committed to repayment of our debts  can it be a duty from the point of view of justice? We shall continue to appeal to continue to the rich countries to follow the example of Canada and Italy  which have taken decisions to alleviate the debt burden by freezing the debts or canceling them altogether. Having said that  we must hasten to add that such measures will prove futile unless they are accompanied by economic and political reforms through which the gains accruing from such measures of alleviation are invested in development  in order to ensure a better life for the deprived classes.The fourth problem is that of the rebellion in some parts of southern Sudan. First  objective  internal factors have caused tension between the north and the south of the country  the most important being religious and ethnic differences and differences in the levels of economic and social progress.Secondly  those objective factors have been complicated by age-old historic and other factors created by colonial rule  when it followed its so-called policy on the south  between 1918 and 1948. That policy re-molded old conflicts into newThirdly  since Sudan's independence Sudanese society  especially in the north  has witnessed an Arab national renaissance movement and an Islamic awakening. Coring that period some sectors of the population in the south have developed an increasing consciousness of their African and Christian identities and a greater feeling of being deprived of participation in public life and of having a lower economic standard of life. The juxtaposition of those factors has led to political and cultural currents in the north and the south flowing in opposite directions.Fourthly  under one-man rule there was implementation of the decisions of the All Sudanese Parties Congress  resulting in the signing of the 1972 agreement  which achieved the necessary reconciliation and provided room to embrace the characteristics of the south. But  surprisingly  that authoritarian regime reversed its stance and imposed on the south policies that broke the agreement; even worse  it shattered those respected and protected characteristics when it introduced what it called Islamic laws. In essence  that was nothing more than a wicked attempt to consolidate its one-man rule and intimidate all its opponents -Muslims  Christians and others - in the name of Islam. Those policies were opposed by many in the south  who regarded them as a flagrant example of the Government's reneging on the peace agreement and of religious intolerance and oppression. Fifthly  as being fully aware of the magnitude of the problem  the present political leadership in the Sudan has called for the convening of a national constitutional conference to examine those and other problems in the country as a whole so as to arrive  through dialog  at an agreement to lay just and acceptable foundations for dealing with the following problems: first  the problem of religion and politics  which has to be solved in a way that will satisfy the aspirations of Muslims  Christians and the followers of other creeds within a modern democratic political and constitutional system-  secondly  the problem of national identity and cultural and ethnic diversity  which must be solved in a way that will define the various identities and their means of coexistence-  thirdly  the question of equitable participation in public and political life  which must be dealt with in such a way as to ensure respect by the majority of regional and ethnic rights in an equitable partnership*  fourthly  the question of economic development and the commitment to an equitable distribution of wealth and public services and development opportunities.These four points throw light on the objective and internal causes of the problem of the south. It is obvious that they are to be found on the same scale in other countries; they are not unique to the Sudan. Although Sudan-is among those countries confronted with problems caused by a backward structure of national unity and the trauma of modernization together with the complexities of the increasing consciousness of origins and roots  it stands out as a country that is able to diagnose and recognize its own problems and has the determination to resolve them peacefully through political dialog.The movement engaged in the present insurrection  which is causing destruction in some parts of the South and which endangers the lives of some of its civilian inhabitants  is quite aware of the peaceful and conciliatory policies of the Government  it has openly made this awareness known in a public statement on 14 August 1986. In spite of all this  however  the insurrection movement has opted for the rejection of the Government's stance and chose to escalate its terrorist activities against civilians  the aged  women and children. The most heinous of those terrorist acts was the downing of a civilian aircraft and the killing of all of its 60 passengers.The terrorist nature of this movement no longer needs proof. Its deeds and declarations speak for themselves. What really needs proof is the movement's inability to make independent decisions and its subservience to the hegemony of a foreign country which uses it for its own interests.Through our own contacts and discussions  it has become clear to us that it is feasible to reach an agreement with the insurrection movement but only if orders to the contrary are not dictated to it by the foreign circles that want to use it to block the reconstruction of our country. Those foreign circles fully dominate the decisions of this insurrection movement  which calls itself the Sudan People's Liberation Movement  by harbouring it in their territory  facilitating its recruitment activities  supplying it with arms  providing it with training  a radio station for broadcasting its propaganda and beaming military orders to its forces and also providing it with food  supplies  logistical support and transport facilities.In its internal dimensions and root causes  the conflict can be addressed by the Sudanese parties in a way that would have required or necessitated no debate or involvement on the part of the United Nations. However  the insurrection movement has gone beyond its Sudanese dimension and has become a terrorist instrument of foreign aggression. It is in this context that it is now necessary for the United Nations to be made aware of the objective realities of the situation  realities which we have already placed before the Organization of African Unity.The new democratic Sudan which draws inspiration from its past and looks hopefully towards its future is moving towards national reconstruction internally and just peace externally. It is determined to overcome all obstacles. The international community is called upon to play its role in creating a favorable international environment based on co-operation and non-aggression.The international community is preoccupied with many issues but here I should like to draw attention to five important questions.The first concerns the United Nations itself. The United Nations is the only world forum where Member States can exchange views and experiences and peacefully resolve conflicts on the basis of equality. Together with its specialized agencies  it has played a considerable role in the maintenance of peace and the promotion of international economic and technical oo-operation.The United Nations membership has grown steadily over the past 40 years. Its bodies and committees have indeed multiplied. This expansion has had a negative impact on the effective utilization of its resources and its ability to co-ordinate its numerous and sometimes overlapping activities. It has become necessary now to study the administrative and financial shortcomings of the Organization with a view to drawing up a comprehensive plan to improve its administrative and financial performance along the lines of the recommendations of the Group of Intergovernmental Experts.In the light of the experience of four decades  the Charter of the United Nations should be revised to incorporate new provisions  such as economic rights  protection of the environment and outer space  and particularly to enhance the effectiveness of the means of maintaining peace and security. In this context  we believe that permanent membership of the Security Council should be expanded to give a seat to every recognized regional group and that the General Assembly should be empowered to override  by a certain majority  a veto in the Security Council  in order to ensure that no one permanent member nay be able to paralyse the international will as expressed by a large majority of Member States.Going beyond criticism of the functioning of the United Nations to questioning its value is an unfortunate trend that represents an attitude of despair and offers oblivion as an alternative to imperfection. The proper attitude now is to recognize the imperfections of the Organization  remove their root causes and make the United Nations what we all wish it to be  now and in the future.The second question is that of the arms race. It has become part of human nature to be armed and militarily ready  as a reflection and a result of social and other forms of competition. However  this has now reached a point where not only are human and other resources wasted  and the environment polluted  but humanity itself is threatened with extinction. Halting the conventional and nuclear-arms race  through bilateral or multilateral negotiations  is therefore of vital importance so that we may release the necessary resources for global prosperity  protect the environment and  above all  avoid a nuclear holocaust.It is the duty of all mankind to reach an agreement to protect outer space from the arms race  limit and eliminate arsenals of destructive weapons and ban the development and stockpiling of chemical and biological weapons. The greatest threat to humanity today is the development of highly destructive nuclear weapons  the existence of large stockpiles of such weapons  sufficient to destroy the whole world many times over  and the computerization of control over the complex weapons systems. Everyone  no matter how reckless  knows that there would be no victor in a nuclear war. Modern nuclear capability is like a boomerang; one cannot hit a target without hitting oneself. Pear alone ensures that no conscious decision to start a nuclear war will be taken  but what of a computer error? A nuclear war triggered by computer error is a possibility and a threat that should be seriously contemplated. It is a moral responsibility of the international community in general and the members of the ""nuclear club"" in particular to give earnest consideration to such dangers and ways and means of defusing them. It is in this context that we welcome the forthcoming Soviet-American summit and hope that the two super-Powers will spare no effort to make it a success  in the light of the great expectations of the peoples of the whole world.The third question concerns the international economic order. Response to the challenge of overcoming underdevelopment and achieving development is a major responsibility of the developing countries and their peoples and Governments. Determination  mobilization  serious planning and effective management are necessary to achieve that goal. However  as long as imbalance and inequity of the the international economic  financial and trading systems continue  the international climate will remain unfavorable and impede the achievement of development and social justice. Several proposals and recommendations from various sources - notably the Brandt Commission - have emphasized the positive role that the developed countries can play in creating a favorable international economic climate. Action on those proposals is urgently needed.Long and useful deliberations have taken place in the United Nations  in particular during the special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. Many African countries are becoming increasingly dependent on external financing. Developed Western countries are busy preaching to and lecturing Africans  while developed Eastern countries are busy criticizing Western policies and positions. Those attitudes are neither healthy nor helpful to Africa. African countries should shoulder their national responsibilities and mobilize the national energies and capabilities. The international community should respond by creating the necessary international economic and financial climate  which should be characterized by a rational distribution of global resources and the much-needed reform of the economic  financial and trading systems. That requires a degree of political will in developed countries to strive to promote on a global scale the kind of prosperity and social peace that they have achieved.I shall now refer to five hotbeds of tension that constitute a major challenge for the international community and call for serious  intensified international action to resolve them and thus defuse the threat they pose to peace and security.The first is Africa's hotbed - South Africa and Namibia. The very existence of the system of apartheid in South Africa is an affront to humanity. It is absolutely necessary that the international community adopt a firm and unambiguous stand against that abhorrent regime through the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions until it is brought down or made to agree to set up a just democratic system based on majority rule. We welcome  in this context  the action by some Western Governments and parliaments  most recently the United States Congress. We hope that those first steps will be followed by others and consolidated to ensure the effectiveness of sanctions against the racist Pretoria regime in South Africa.The continued illegal occupation of Namibia by the racist South African regime  in violation of the relevant United Nations resolutions  constitutes one of the principal sources of changes to international peace and security in Africa. That  too  requires firm international action to isolate the racist regime and force it to withdraw unconditionally from Namibia and thus enable the Namibian people to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.The second hotbed is the Arab's major cause - the question of Palestine. Just as the intransigent and aggressive policies of racist South Africa constitute a threat to world peace  so the usurpation by Israel of the rights of the Palestinians and its occupation of neighboring Arab lands since 1976 constitute a similar threat to world peace. A just and lasting peace can be achieved only through full recognition of the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination  to return to their homeland and to create their independent State on their national soil of Palestine. It is evident that the best forum for the search for a just peace would be provided by the convening of an international conference under United Nations auspices  with the participation of all the parties concerned  especially the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.The next burning issue is the primary Asian problem  namely  that of Afghanistan. We look forward to an independent Afghanistan  free from any foreign presence. In that connection we welcome the partial withdrawal of Soviet troops  which we hope is a first phase to be followed by others. We also welcome the Afghan-Pakistan negotiations and hope that they will be widened to include all the Afghan parties so that a comprehensive peaceful solution may be achieved. We also commend the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and call upon him to play a role in realizing that objective.The fourth hotbed of tension is in Central America. The solution to that problem lies in the strong tide of democracy that has arisen in the region. We hope that that tendency will be consolidated and that it will be accompanied by the cessation of foreign intervention and interference  so that the countries of the region may enjoy democracy and national independence.The next world problem is also a problem for the Islamic world in particular  namely  the Gulf war. No one can dispute the fact that the Gulf war has resulted in huge losses of life and property; nor can there be any disagreement that the war will not resolve the long-standing  historical differences between the warring parties. It must be stopped  and all problems  inherited and new  must be resolved through peaceful negotiations.It is legitimate to ask how that war can be stopped. If the answer to that question is not to lead to a dead end  the ending of the war must be based on a clear desire on both sides to stop it and on agreement on how best to do so. Various parties  such as the Muslim ulema and Islamic popular movements  must play a part in putting an end to the war. The United Nations  too  has a role to play  in investigating the underlying causes of the dispute and the events that led toits outbreak and in assessing the resultant losses and determining the reparations that can pave the way to peaceful consideration of the issues involved.While calling upon the Muslin ulema and Islamic popular movements to contribute to creating a climate of opinion on ways to put an end to the war  we also call upon the United Nations to renew and continue its endeavors to bring the war  which has resulted in such enormous losses  to a just and definitive end. The achievement of a just and decisive conclusion to the war has become both an Islamic and a humanitarian duty.The United Nations is called upon to contain all these hotbeds of tension  the existence of which constitutes a major challenge to the international community and at the same time presents the Organization with an opportunity to prove its worth and its relevance to the well-being of mankind and its aspirations to a better future.The new Sudan  together with all other well-intentioned members of the international community  stands ready to play its part in enhancing the mission of the United Nations and improving its performance  in order to make it a true guardian and impregnable bastion of peace and international co-operation  the prerequisites for survival on this planet  which the revolution in communication and technology has turned into a village with a common destiny.The PRESIDENT: On behalf of the General Assembly  I thank the Prime Minister and Minister of defense of the Republic of the Sudan for the important statement he has just made."
"119",6124,"SEN",41,1986," In conveying to Ambassador Choudhury our heartfelt congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly  the delegation of Senegal wishes to reflect our feelings of respect and admiration for his great human qualities and pay a tribute to the abiding commitment of his country to the cause of peace and friendship among peoples. At a time when we are all discussing our Organization's future prospects  it is fortunate that he was chosen to guide the work of this important session. In assuring him of its complete goodwill and genuine co-operation  my delegation expresses the conviction that  given his characteristic patience and intelligent authority  he will guide the 1986 session to outstanding results.His predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  commanded the admiration and gratitude of all members of the Assembly. During a particularly busy year he certainly lived up to his reputation as an outstanding diplomat and once again gave proof of his wide  profound knowledge of the problems of our time  as well as his perfect mastery of the rules and procedures of the United Nations.I should also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose whole-hearted devotion to the promotion of peace and harmony among nations is known throughout the world. A man of conviction  courage and action  he deserves the international community's trust and support in the immense endeavor that he is directing and in the reforms he is proposing so that this Organization  which is so dear to our peoples and Governments  can be adapted to the greatest extent possible to the needs of today's world and remain the hope of humanity.There are years in the history of the United Nations that cannot be passed over in silence. The 12 months that have just elapsed were one such period  so filled were they with events of great political significance.The fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  which we commemorated here last year  provided an opportunity to reaffirm our faith in and devotion to the purposes and principles of the Charter and thus to renew the commitment of our peoples to greater co-operation in bringing about a better world.Despite differences in our ideological preferences  social and politicalsystems  cultural traditions and levels of economic development  we are aware thatour civilizations are complementary and that there is a need for solidarity amongall mankind as we face the many challenges threatening mankind and its environment and the despair  pessimism and anguish aroused by the proliferation and persistenceof pockets of tension  the exacerbation of conflicts  intolerance and blindviolence  and the ever-increasing imbalance in political said economic relations among nations.I am addressing this Assembly on behalf of His Excellency President Abdou Diouf  and I wish to speak of the spirit of international solidarity and co-operation  and of the ardent desire that the work of this forty-first session may make a meaningful contribution to the common effort of nations in the inspiring task of building a world of peace  justice  freedom and prosperity.The crisis facing the community of nations is the result of the international order established some 40 years ago  after the Second World War. That international order  which continues today to govern relations among States  contains anomalies and contradictions that have been denounced in this Assembly many times. I wish to discuss some of these anomalies and contradictions  which include the persistence of colonialism and racism and of foreign intervention and occupation  increasing poverty in the third world  and attempts to upset the multilateral system.In this framework  if there is an item on our agenda whose consideration requires of us more open-mindedness  boldness  collective discipline  honesty  generosity and dignity - all qualities common to our civilized values - it is without a doubt the developments in the situation in southern Africa  where time is running out. In fact  attempts to consolidate the policy of apartheid  whose brand of logic and whose effects are so well known  are a threat to peace and a serious attack cm the ideals of mankind peace  justice  freedom and equality.Faced by the valiant resistance of the anti-apartheid militants to an odious  inhuman policy imposed in violation of all legal rules and ethical standards  the minority racist Pretoria regime has enacted a whole array of arbitrary laws  regulations and practices. Using these  and under the cower of a state of emergency  it is intensifying and refining its repression of the legitimate demands of the people of South Africa for equality and democracy.The South African regime has given new proof of its arrogant position of systematic rejection of all offers for a negotiated solution by scorning the initiatives of the Commonwealth group of seven eminent persons and of the European Economic Community. It has increased its blind repression  which is marked by arrests and deliberate murders of members of the anti-apartheid forces  and by the muzzling of the national and international press.Pretoria has adopted a deliberate policy of destabilization  aggression and invasion towards neighboring African States  trampling underfoot the principles of the United Nations Charter and of international laws sovereignty  the territorial integrity of States  non-intervention  and the non-use of force. But the march of history is irreversible.At Paris  from 16 to 20 June this year  in response to an appeal from the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the international communitymet at the World Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  which coincided with the tenth anniversary of the So we to massacres. On that anniversary the suffering South African people determined to spare neither its blood nor its very life to pay a tribute to those who died at Soweto  sacrificed on the altar of freedom and human dignity.The Paris Conference reflected the general  irreversible trend in favor of sanctions to make Pretoria end its anachronistic policy of a par the id  and the participants advocated the adoption of joint  comprehensive  mandatory and binding measures against South Africa. Realism and a genuine devotion to human rights require the Western Powers that are still reluctant to adopt sanctions against South Africa to join the rest of the international community in imposing such sanctions  which is the only peaceful way to root out apartheid  that blot on our era. That would enable the Security Council to shoulder the primary and historic responsibility entrusted to it by the United Nations Charter in the sphere of the maintenance of international peace and security  which would include action under Chapter VII of that basic instrument.Reason tells us that the only way to ensure a viable future for southern Africa is to establish a regime of equality  democracy and brotherhood. All of us must demonstrate our genuine commitment to the ideals of the world Organization by ensuring the triumph of its universal principles  of re as cm and of wisdom. The United Nations must formulate a coherent program of assistance to the front-line countries and to the combatants of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  the Pan Africanism Congress of Azania (PAC) and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  in order to reflect in our actions the solidarity with those freedom fighters which is the duty of the international community.Deeds reflecting that duty of solidarity are eagerly awaited in Namibia as well. South Africa has occupied that Territory illegally for 20 years now  ever since it was decided to terminate its Mandate over the Territory and make Namibia the direct responsibility of the United Nations.Although  at the time  it stated its support for the settlement plan contained in resolution 435 (1978)  adopted by the Security Council eight years ago  the South African Government - with its attitude of defiance and arrogance towards the United Nations - persists in its expansionist designs and is seeking to impose  through a so-called tripartite conference  an ""interim government""; it tries to conceal its annexationist objective behind the introduction into the peaceful settlement of the Namibian problem of alien and unacceptable considerations  and it uses Namibian territory as a base for launching acts of aggression against the front-line countries.Senegal reaffirms here that all the Members of the United Nations must show greater determination to ensure the total  and not the watered-down  implementation of resolution 435 (1978). That has been stressed by various international meetings and conferences held on Namibia  the most recent being the Vienna Conference and the last special session of the General Assembly  in that connection  it should not be forgotten that the Namibian question is  in actual fact  a problem of pure decolonization emanating from resolution 1514 (XV)  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.Just as in southern Africa - where the hateful system of apartheid sows terror  violence and oppression - in the Middle East  for almost 20 years now Arab territories have been occupied and the Palestinian people have been reduced to the status of wanderers. Despite two wars and several settlement plans  the situation remains grim and is a constant threat to international peace and security. Lebanon remains beset by chaos  while in the Arab territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the resistance by the people is being stifled by ferocious repression. In spite of everything  the Tel Aviv authorities persist in their policy of establishing settlements and annexing Palestinian and Arab territories - all offenses of the establishment of a Palestinian State and therefore of a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem.But the Security Council  like the General Assembly  has long since taken a stand against the acquisition of territory by force and has been demanding Israel's withdrawal from the territories it occupies. Moreover  there are the numerous recommendations by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People as well as the Geneva International Conference on Palestine  held three years ago  which advocated a peace conference on the Middle East as a framework for negotiations on a comprehensive j.sace. Those recommendations were approved by the overwhelming majority of States Members of this Organization. But Israel stubbornly ignores them and drags out the Palestinian tragedy through short-term ploys which cannot in any way change the fact that there will be no peace in the Middle East so long as the Palestinian people  represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  does not effectively exercise its inalienable rights to self-determination and independence in the land of Palestine.It is appropriate to stress once again the duty of all the Members of the Organization - and particularly those to which the Charter has given special responsibilities - to promote the creation of conditions that can assist the various parties to the conflict  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  to negotiate a just and lasting peace on an equal footing  within the framework of a genuine international conference.It looks as though the question of Afghanistan and the situation in Kampuchea will be on the General Assembly's agenda for a long time to come. In both cases  foreign occupation continues  subjecting the peoples of the countries concerned.to an intolerable and unjust situation imposed by Powers that are full-fledged Members of this Organization. In both cases  under the relevant resolutions adopted by theGeneral Assembly  the appropriate conditions must be created to enable the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea to exercise their right to decide their own future. In both cases  the constructive and responsible dialog that has been urged  on the one hand  by the Ad Hoc Committee cm Kampuchea  of which my country has the honor to be Chairman  and  on the other hand  in the United Nations resolutions on Afghanistan  represent both an organizational and a guiding framework of overriding importance.He take the same approach to the conflict between Iran and Iraq and to the situation in Central America.With regard to Central America  the political settlement of internal and external conflicts should go hand in hand with regional guarantees of security and non-interference and with absolute respect for the sovereignty of States  as advocated by the Contadora Group.With regard to the situation in the Gulf  the international community has no choice but to persevere in its efforts to persuade the leaders of the two warring countries to use peaceful means to put an end to their dispute  in keeping with the wishes of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations.Finally  with regard to the Korean peninsula  we still hope for peaceful reunification of the two sides  within the framework of sincere and fraternal co-operation  duly reflecting the free will of the Korean people as a whole.World peace cannot be restored and maintained merely by defusing pockets of tension and eliminating conflicts. Because of the increasing interdependence of States  resolute commitment and sustained effort by the community of nations are also required in the joint search for appropriate solutions to the serious economic challenges. This necessitates intelligence  knowledge and know-how throughout the world  more specifically in the developing countries.Mich has been said and written about the crisis in the international economic system  particularly its manifestations and the measures likely to alleviate them. Hence  I need not go into that again here. But allow me to stress one particular aspect of this problem in which ray delegation is particularly interested  for reasons well known to everyone here. I have in mind the problems relating to the critical economic situation in Africa  which has mobilized so much energy and imagination throughout this year and particularly during the special session that the General Assembly devoted to the question from 27 to 31 May last.Orice again  on behalf of President Abdou Diouf and all my African colleagues -whose spokesman I was during that special session on Africa - I pay a tribute to the Members of our Organization  which  in a spirit of genuine partnership  made an invaluable contribution to the battle for the development of the African continent  by giving unreserved support to the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recovery  1986-1990. The adoption by consensus of that Programne of Action  the main points of which are familiar to everyone here  should not be an end in itself but  rather  the point of departure in a process marked by active solidarity  a process that should lead to the rehabilitation of African economies in a healthier world climate.Senegal would like  through me  to state once again that it is determined to respect scrupulously its commitments towards the other African countries  such as those it has entered into  along with the rest of Africa  towards the international community concerning the implementation of that Program in the areas designated as priority areas for the period from 1986 to 1990. The international community cannot renege on its obligations either. It must  as it has freely promised  support and supplement the individual and collective efforts of the African States and take the additional measures needed in order to improve the international climate  particularly with regaled to the problems of debt  commodity prices and protectionism. In this regard  after the decision by Canada to suspend repayment of African debt for the five years' period of implementation of the United Nations plan for the recovery and economic development of Africa and that by Netherlands to cancel the debts of the least developed African States - measures that we welcomed at the time - we were pleased to hear the announcement by Mr. Andreotti  the Foreign Minister of Italy  that his country had decided to allow African States indebted to Italy to convert the debts to be repaid over a certain number of years into aid credits at reduced interest rates of not more than 1.5 per cent  with reimbursement periods of 20 years  with a 10-year period of grace.Proper incrementation of the recovery Program will require a substantial increase in the financial resources of the international organizations concerned with the development of Africa  both by building up and increasing their capital and by supporting the African Programs of those international development financing organizations. The process that has thus been started must spark a true resurrection of North-South dialog and provide a privileged area for testing South-South co-operation. Africa's active participation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) conference at Punta del Este  the concertedpreparations it intends to make for the next session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (CJNCTAD) and its positive contribution at the Conference on Economic Co-operation among Developing Countries  held in Cairo from 18 to 23 August 1986  and also at the eighth summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  recently held in Harare  attest to our continent's loyalty to that commitment.Concerted implementation of all the recommendations contained in the Program for the rehabilitation of the African economies would specifically reflect the awareness  which is now universal  of the interdependence of the economies of the North and the South and also the ability of mankind to meet the major challenges it faces.My delegation has great pleasure in paying a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for the important steps he has taken to ensure that the decisions taken at the special session on the economic situation in Africa are acted upon. He has done so by setting up a high-level multidisciplinary team within the United Nations Secretariat and by arranging the forthcoming meeting in Africa of the secretariats of the Organization of African Unity and the Economic Commission for Africa on the one hand and  on the other  the various regional and subregional African organizations involved in the implementation of the five-year Program.The international community is confronting serious difficulties which affect many intergovernmental organizations. These difficulties  which are commonly referred to as a ""crisis of multilateralism""  are clearly viewed as constituting one of the most serious threats of our time to international co-operation and solidarity.At a time when the scope and complexity of the challenges confronting the international community call for greater unity of thought and action from States at a time when scientific and technical progress  which considerably increases not only scientific but also economic and political exchanges of all kinds among nations  offers mankind enormous possibilities of communication  mutual understanding and solidarity  the multilateral system that was established after the Second World War  the positive evolution of which made it universal and democratic  is being seriously challenged by the re-emergence of political chauvinism  economic protectionism  social selfishness and imperial faits accomplis.The United Nations  whose fortieth anniversary last year gave all the Member States and opportunity to assess it positively  is now going through the most serious crisis of its existence. It is unnecessary to go once again into the administrative and financial aspects of this crisis  for the fortieth session of the General Assembly  which recently ended  debated that question sufficiently.When the causes of the malaise are analysed  stress is often placed on the crisis of confidence of the third-world countries with regard to the effectiveness of the United Nations. It is a fact that the enthusiasm that the birth of the United Nations aroused in the peace-loving and justice-loving peoples has gradually diminished as the Organization encountered increasing difficulties in ensuring the maintenance of international peace and security and in helping young nations in their enormous tasks of national reconstruction and economic development. There has often been great frustration among the States of Africa  Latin America and Asia which  emerging from the long dark night of colonization  being poor and confronted with difficulties of all kinds  placed great hopes on the ideals of peace  solidarity  justice and equity enshrined in the San Francisco Charter. The slowness with which Organization reacted to certain emergency situations  and also the structural obstacles to its actions  in southern Africa and the Middle East  to mention only two cases  led to certain doubts on the part of some small States. However  this crisis of confidence is really more like a lovers' quarrel than a rejection. It reflects the profound and sincere commitment of the countries of Africa  Latin America and Asia to the United Nations. The most serious threat comes from the larger States  which  unable to continue to control the decision-making process in the Organization  are trying to remove particularly important questions from its consideration  adopting a position of systematic obstruction in its agencies or trying to deprive it of any real meaning by systematically denigrating its procedures and continually violating its rules and principles.An examination of the present situation of our Organization must make us think back to the situation faced by the League of Nations in the 1930s. The crisis that paralyzed the work of the League  faced as it was with the increased dangers of authoritarianism and its attendant attacks on justice and human dignity  was preceded by a depression that plunged the world  from 1929 onwards  into unprecedented economic and social chaos.The present crisis is but a reflection of the divisions  tensions and injustices of today's world. Let us therefore be careful not to imperil the Organization's existence  as happened in the 1930s in the case of the League  at a time when its framework and principles are more necessary than ever to resolve those contradictions.Because it believes in the ability of nations to face up to the challenges of history  my country remains confident in the Organization's future. It is convinced that the crisis may even have a healthy effect  if together we can learn the lessons it has to teach us.The international community must avoid a repetition of the unhappy experience of the 1930s  when policies based on acute nationalism  massive and systematic violations of the most elementary human rights and a cult of force at the expense of law  led directly to fatal breaches of the peace. We must recall how indifference towards international co-operation and short-term political calculations threatened the framework of the League  contributed to the economic and social chaos and led the world to what was almost its self-destruction.On the other hand  let us reread and remember the passionate speeches at the first session of our Assembly. The United Nations  founded after the most deadly war in mankind's history  was then seen as both a symbol and an indispensable tool. As a symbol  the United Nations embodied the profound aspiration of the international community for a more democratic  more egalitarian  more just and more stable world  in which all States  big and small  would feel a common responsibility for the well-being of mankind. As a tool  our Organization offered the best framework for promoting international co-operation in the service of peace and security  reconstruction and development.That is why since their accession to independence the former colonies in Africa  Asia and Latin America have en mass become members of the Organization  thus confirming its universality and giving it the dynamism and diversity that have enabled it to write the finest pages in the history of multilateral co-operation. Just as the need for international co-operation to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" was clear in 1945  when the United Nations was founded  today it is still essential strongly to reaffirm and strictly to apply with the principles of our Charter.Senegal solemnly reaffirms its unswerving devotion to the principles of the Charter and its unshakable faith in international co-operation as a way to promote peace  justice and equality and as a tool for understanding between nations in the service of the higher common goals of mankind at this threshold of the second millennium."
"120",6171,"SGP",41,1986," We meet this year under inauspicious circumstances. There is a storm brewing that threatens to sink the United Nations. We are fortunate to be guided by you Sir  in this difficult moment. Coming from a brother country in Asia  we know that Bangladesh has weathered many a storm with courage  determination and grit. With this background and your considerable political and diplomatic experience  I am confident that you will provide us with the right leadership to guide us through the difficult days ahead.Please allow me also to pause a moment to place on record our deep appreciation for the work done by your predecessor  Ambassador Jaime de Pinies. He saw the United Nations through one of its most triumphant moments  the fortieth anniversary celebrations. He also provided firm and determined leadership at the resumed session to ensure that the financial crisis did not overwhelm the United Nations. We thank him.There is a consensus that the United Nations is going through one of its most difficult periods. Some call it the ""crisis of multilateralism"". The Chinese word for ""crisis"" is a combination of two characters: ""danger"" Wei and ""opportunity"" This is the situation that the United Nations faces today.The danger is clear. The gradual erosion of faith in the United Nations  evidenced by the growing practice of financial withholdings  threatens the financial integrity of the Organization. The Secretary-General has periodically issued reports on the ""current financial crisis"" to remind Members how fragile the financial situation is. In his report dated 21 August 1986  he said that against assessed contributions of $US 978 million payable as at 1 January 1986  only $US 568 million had been collected by the end of July. If these withholdings continue  the United Nations may have to cease operations one day.What is to be done? One thing is clear. A ship passing through a storm cannot proceed under full sail. When treacherous winds and currents appear seasoned sailors trim their sails  batten down their hatches and offload excess baggage. Wisely  the captain of our ship  the Secretary-General  has begun doing this. Even more wisely  the Member States endorsed his actions at the resumed session of the General Assembly in April this year.These are  however  only short-term measures. For the long term  the United Nations can only continue to function when there is a reasonable consensus among all its Members that this is an Organization worth saving. The fortieth anniversary celebrations  which saw the largest gathering mankind has seen of Heads of State or Government  seemed to indicate that all nations were committed to this Organization. One year later  the United Nations coffers are running dry. The same nation States have locked up their purses. Such actions always speak louder than words.The money needed to save the United Nations is a pittance. The annual budget of the United Nations is $US 800 million. It is just a drop in the ocean compared to the world's combined income of about $US 13 trillion  or more accurately it is only 0.006 per cent of the combined world income. If our world is not able to squeeze out this small amount to keep the United Nations functioning  it is a clear sign that the international community has lost faith in the United Nations.It will not be easy to rebuild this Organization. The small States  which make up the vast majority of the membership  have never lost faith. They know that global adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter is crucial for their survival. We need the United Nations  as Article 1 of the Charter states: ""to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples"". If these principles disappear  together with the United Nations  life for the small States could become very hazardous.Yet a United Nations composed only of small States would be a pointless Organization. The threats to small States will always come from the medium-sized States and the big Powers. We need their continued adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter. And we need their continued commitment to the Organization. How can we achieve this?Perhaps we should see what the small States did at the very beginning of the United Nations. Here I quote from the classic work of Inis Claude  ""Swords into Plowshares"":""Small States are not necessarily the saints of the international community; if great nations are inclined to abuse their strength by behaving dictatorially  small ones are often tempted to abuse their weakness by behaving irresponsibly. But many small State representatives at San Francisco displayed a high degree of statesmanship. They did not challenge the principle of great Power leadership. Indeed  they welcomed it and relied upon it  but they made great and somewhat successful exertions to modify it  and to confine its expression within tolerable bounds."" (New York  Random House: 3rd edition  1964  p. 57) Unfortunately  many small States have failed to realize the wisdom of such moderation in our deliberations. Instead; we have constantly passed resolutions  routinely  recklessly and often selectively condemning a great Power. This has not brought us any closer to our goal of convincing any great Power to behave otherwise. All our resolutions should be carefully crafted  tempered by wisdom and judgment  to persuade great Powers that it is in their interest to take cognizance of the needs of small States. The reckless attacks of previous years have led to the inevitable result that both the Soviet Union and the United States decided  no matter what their other disagreements may be  to ignore and sometimes to undermine the United Nations. It is not surprising that the largest financial withholdings have been made by the Soviet Union and the United States. The art of political moderation must be relearned by all of us.The immediate complaints of the super-Powers and the larger nation States concern the financial management of the Organization. The Secretary-General has wisely alerted us to their complaints. He said on 18 December 1985:""Even though the budget adopted by the Fifth Committee provides for a real growth of only 0.1 per cent. Member States which account for almost 80 per cent of the assessed budget either cast a negative vote or abstained in the vote. This is disturbing evidence of a growing division in the membership on financial matters which  if long continued  can have very negative implications for the Organization.This financial crisis is only a symptom of greater disillusionment with the United Nations. None the less  we can and should resolve it quickly. The choice for small States is clear. We can either continue to engage in long and unseemly negotiations over the finances needed to keep the United Nations going or we can concentrate on substantive political issues. The longer we argue over what is  relatively  a financial drop in the ocean  the less attention we can pay to substantive political issues.If we fail to resolve these financial problems the United Nations will shrink ana die. If it dies  all its considerable political achievements over the years and all the resolutions that we have adopted reaffirming the inter national community's moral and legitimate stands on the critical issues of apartheid and Namibia  the Middle East and Palestine and Kanpuchea and Afghanistan will also disappear.Fortunately for us  the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts  which was entrusted with the task of reviewing administrative and financial matters in the United Nations  has come up with a reasonable report recommending some reforms. Staff should be reduced by 15 per cent and the overstaffed higher levels by 25 per cent. Fewer consultants should be hired. Official travel should be curtailed. The political departments should be consolidated. The forty-first session of the General Assembly should quickly endorse those recommendations.There is  unfortunately  one unresolved issue in the report of the Group of Kigh-Level Intergovernmental Experts  and this concerns the critical question of budgetary management. I fear that if this issue is not resolved quickly the financial crisis will drag on. The existence of the United Nations will continue to be precarious. Each time the Organization stumbles the interests of the small States suffer. As they make up the vast majority of the membership  the small States can easily vote in any budgetary procedure they like - as the* have tended to do  against the wishes of the larger States  in regard to budgetary natters. This reckless use of our votes has unfortunately led us to the present crisis and will only ensure the continuation of the crisis. If we try to do the same with the budgetary procedure  we shall only aggravate the problems of the United Nations  and solve none.last year  just before the fortieth anniversary celebrations  former Presidents of the General Assembly met at a seminar in !Mew York. With their collective wisdom  they passed on some pieces of advice to us. One was that the making of decisions by consensus should be encouraged and incorporated in the rules of procedure. We should heed that advice. Consensus is what we should aim for in financial matters.Where I come from  in South-East Asia  we have word for consensus: it is mushawarah. Consensus  in our definition  consensus does not mean that any Member State  large or small  has the power of veto. It means a spirit of give and take  a spirit of understanding each other 's interests.Fundamentally  this is the new understanding we have to recreate in the United Nations. We have to rebuild the political compact that once existed between the small States and the great Powers on the role and purpose of the United Nations. We cannot afford to ignore the views of the great Powers. The Charter itself confers many special responsibilities on the five permanent member States of the Security Council  including the high responsibility of selecting the Secretary-General.Those special rights go hand in hand with a special duty and obligation to maintain the strength and integrity of the Organization. Tragically  four of the five permanent member States have not taken their duties seriously in respect of their financial obligations. They have indulged in the illegal practice of withholding finance  which threatens to cripple the Organization.Article 17 (2) of the United Nations Charter clearly states that""The expenses of the Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General Assembly."" The operative word is ""shall"". It is our obligation as States Members of the United Nations to pay our assessed contributions to the United Nations budget whatever complaints we may have about the Organization. As a gesture of good faith  permanent members should cease the illegal practice of withholding and pay their dues.I do not expect that these problems will be resolved easily or quickly. Political trends evolve slowly. Even though the anti-United Nations mood is at a high point in many countries  the pendulum will swing back if the United Nations sends the right signals to the international community. Until these difficult moments pass and the storm clears  the United Nations will have to run a tight ship  and our captain  the Secretary-General  must quickly resolve the administrative and other management problems that plague the Organization.We are counting upon the President of the General Assembly to forge a consensus agreement on budgetary questions that will be acceptable to all Member States  to ensure that the financial trickle that keeps the Organization going will not dry up completely in the near future."
"121",6204,"SLB",41,1986," I congratulate you most warmly and sincerely  Sir  on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. I am sure that  with your wide experience  you will discharge your task with success.I wish also to thank your predecessor. Ambassador Jaime de Pini6s of Spain  for the exemplary work he did during the historic fortieth session.My gratitude goes also to the Secretary-General  His ExcellencyMr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless efforts in administering the affairs of this Organization.I take this opportunity to convey to all Member and Observer States  organizations and agencies of the United Nations the friendly greetings and felicitations of my Government and people. Five months ago  my country was hit by a most devastating cyclone. It was the worst in our recorded history. More than 100 people died  and some 90 000 were left homeless. Many thousands more were leftwithout food. The damage to our basic economic and social infrastructure in the key areas of our country was so extensive that it has put us back about 10 years in our development effort.It was gratifying  therefore  to have had immediate practical assistance from this Organization  from other organizations  and from many friendly States from near and far. To each and every one of them we say  ""Tagio tumas an God blesim lufala""  which means ""Thank you very much  and God bless you all"".During the past year we have witnessed some interesting regional and global developments  in our own region  the seventeenth South Pacific Forum unanimously decided to request that New Caledonia be restored to the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. That decision was based on the fact that New Caledonia is in our region and that the indigenous people there have clearly expressed their desire for self-determination and independence. Solomon Islands respects this  and reaffirms its commitment to the Forum leaders' decision  it urges all States Members of this Organization to recognize that the underlying intention is to bring about a peaceful transition in New Caledonia.My Government believes that the only sensible course is to allow the United Nations to oversee the transition of New Caledonia to independence and nationhood  so that further bloodshed can be avoided. The United Nations has successful supervised such transitions by many countries that are now Member States. We are certain that the United Nations  in co-operation with the Government of France and the indigenous people of New Caledonia  can ensure that the best possible arrangement will be formulated to enable the inhabitants of that Territory to determine their own future destiny.In that connection  the Government of Solomon islands warmly welcomes the decision on the question Movement. The Non-Aligned Movement's statement clearly shows the importance its members attach to decolonization. It was indeed a historic expression of solidarity and brotherhood with the Forum leaders on this subject  and it is fundamental to the future peace and stability of our region. My Government applauds this initiative of the Non-Aligned Movement and we are grateful to the members of the Movement for the recognition they have given to the South Pacific Forum as an important organization in our region.The area of fisheries is a key element in our overall economic development. It represents a fundamental resource  both for our own local consumption and for our export earnings. Hence  we are naturally concerned about its orderly development. That concern hinges on the need for recognition of our legislative requirements. Under our Fisheries Act  any foreign fishing vessel must be licensed to fish in our 200-mile fisheries zone. Our license fees are negotiable and are always fair and reasonable. But failure to comply with the Act will result in our having to seize vessels that are caught in illegal fishing.He have had cases of that in the past  and I can say here that that experience does not augur well Cor the maintenance of cordial and friendly relations. As a peace-loving nation  Solomon Islands subscribes to. international co-operation  and that is why we are determined to tap our fisheries resources  including highly migratory species  in co-operation with those distant water-fishing nations genuinely willing to assist us. Our Fisheries Act is non-discriminatory. He will license any foreign fishing vessel from any nation prepared to pay the right price.Nuclear testing by France continues to be an issue of grave concern in the South Pacific region. I am therefore obliged to repeat the consistent and genuine position of Solomon Islands*  we are opposed to it. All the countries of the Forum are unanimous in their condemnation of this inhumane activity. It has been claimed that there is no danger involved in carrying out these tests. If that is so  why then does France not conduct them along its own Atlantic coastline?Super-Power rivalry is an issue of growing importance in the South Pacific region. He have been intrigued by and have observed with much interest certain developments in our region that reflect that rivalry  and we have come to the sad conclusion that the end result can only be the region's destabilization. For Solomon Islands  such rivalry is unwelcome to the extent that it projects a tinge of colonial domination. We do not wish to be recolonized or dominated. He have already determined our philosophy and have decided upon a system of Government that upholds the principles of democracy  and we will not depart from that.As regards human rights an.d individual freedoms  I wish to stress here that Solomon Islands has them clearly enshrined in its national Constitution. Not only do we uphold them  but we practice them with civility and humility.With regard to other regional conflicts  I wish to reemphasize our stand on the situations in South Africa  the Middle East  Afghanistan  Kampuchea and the Korean peninsula.The situation in southern Africa is still a grave cause for concern. Apartheid is the most evil form of human deprivation. As it has in the past  my Government strongly condemns apartheid and urges those States that support  in one way or another  the racist Government of South Africa  to disengage themselves  practically and realistically  from perpetuating the survival of the Pretoria regime. He believe that a concerted effort by the international community to apply economic sanctions would be effective in pursuing this objective. The success of such measures in the liberation of Zimbabwe is a good basis from which to work. We earnestly believe that the time is now right for positive action  for action that will ensure the establishment of freedom and democracy in South Africa.In pursuit of that noble aim  my Government stands firm in its policy of wishing to see apartheid dismantled so that fairness and justice may become the norms of life for all peoples in South Africa. Free and fair elections must be the sole determinant for bringing about majority government in that country.The fourteenth special session of the General Assembly that was held from 17to 20 September 1986 marked another in the long line of concerted efforts toliberate Namibia and its people from south Africa's neocolonialism andimperialism. My Government sincerely hopes that  given the clearly expressedconcern of the Assembly and the equally clear voices for freedom that trumpetedfrom around the globe  this liberating assemblage of nations  both large and small is now nearing the end of the tunnel and will begin to see the dawning light of independence for Namibia.It is appropriate that that special session was held this year  for 1986 marks the twentieth anniversary of the termination of South Africa's Mandate over Namibia by the United Nations General Assembly on 27 October 1966. But  will it take another two decades before the people of Namibia can exercise their inalienable  right to self-determination and independence  free from aggression  subversion and suppression by the apartheid regime in South Africa?The answer must surely be ""No"" - not because of the length of time  not because we are getting old and tired  not because South Africa's apartheid is on the verge of collapse. He say ""No"" simply because it is that people's inalienable right and must therefore be honored and respected. This is what the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples of 1960 in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) is all about; to enable all peoples of all colonial countries to exercise their inalienable rights to self-determination and independence.Although it was not possible for me to make a statement during the special session on Namibia  I can say now that we subscribe to the main thrust of the resolution that was adopted. Taking further advantage of this occasion  I should like to make explicitly clear my Government's position on Namibia. We fully support immediate independence  with territorial integrity intact  for Namibia. Work towards the achievement of that objective is the direct responsibility of the United Nations. In the struggle of Namibia to attain self-determination and national independence  the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) is the sole and authentic representative of Namibia's people. We do not recognize the so-called interim government in Namibia  which was imposed by South Africa. We strongly condemn South Africa's illegal and colonial occupation of Namibia  and we regard the Pretoria racist Government's acts of aggression  subversion and destabilization as serious threats to international peace and security. We continue to hold that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is the only acceptable basis for a peaceful settlement of the Namibian question  and we urge its immediate implementation without modification  qualification or precondition.The peace process in the Middle East  if pursued successfully  will be a cornerstone for international peace and security. Today  I express here the hope of my Government that the renewed efforts to continue dialog between the parties involved will eventually lead to an end of the conflict in this region. We also have the same desire to see an end to the Iran-Iraq conflict.Our position on the situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea remains unchanged  We have already condemned the occupation of Afghanistan by foreign forces. We still strongly condemn the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for this action and urge its Government to give effect to its platitudes about not interfering in the internal affairs of other States. Let freedom and democracy return to Afghanistan With respect to Kampuchea  Solomon Islands reaffirms its condemnation of Viet Nam for its illegal occupation of that country. In this respect  my Government welcomes the eight-point proposal put forward by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. This proposal holds out the best hope for a negotiated settlement. In our view  it is a genuine attempt which is capable of accommodating the divergences and differences that exist in this situation.The reunification of the two Koreas is a subject of interest not only to the Korean people but also to the Pacific region and the international community. But the pursuit of reunification should take place without outside interference. The decision to reunite must be left to the Korean people themselves. The starting point  however  is for this international body to recognize that there are two clearly distinguishable States: North Korea and South Korea  both of which are Observer States of this Organization and have individual membership in the various bodies and agencies of the United Nations family  it is my Government's firm view that  as two separate States at this juncture  they should both be admitted as Members of the United Nations until such time as reunification has been finally achieved  at which time their membership would naturally be merged into one. Their admission to this Organization would enhance the prospect of establishing durable peace on the peninsula and would lead to successful reunification.I now wish to turn briefly to the global economic scene and some important issues relating to development. For small developing States whose fragile economies are so vulnerable to outside influences the experience of the past 12 months has not been encouraging. Depressed commodity prices and increased protectionism in some industrialized countries are a burden. Even while we are struggling to earn revenues for basic services such as health and education  the developed industrialized countries are talking in terms of spending billions of dollars on the manufacture of war weapons  I feel there is a serious imbalance  for while some of us are concerned about the plight of our peoples lacking some of the basic necessities of life - food   shelter and clothing - the industrialized world is bent on piling up more and more armaments.My delegation wishes to associate itself with the universal condemnation of international terrorism. Recent incidents in Beirut and Paris clearly demonstrate the urgent need for the international community to combat this heinous and barbaric practice by those who can only be regarded as criminals and murderers. Another equally evil and satanic practice is drug abuse and illegal drug trafficking. My Government condemns those responsible  and pledges to do whatever it can within its limited means to help eradicate this disease in all its forms.So much has already been said in the past few weeks  and I am sure much more will follow  on the United Nations system itself. In particular  grave concern has been expressed regarding the funding and the management of the Organization.My Government shares many of these concerns and supports the general view that cost-effective measures should be sought and finally adopted to bring about efficiency and cost savings. In our view  the report of the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts on the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations is a good basis from which to start. Certain rumors have been heard to the effect that the role of the United Nations itself is in great jeopardy. While there may be grounds for such pessimism  Solomon Islands does not subscribe to that view. As a small nation Solomon Islands regards the United Nations as the only international body that can continue to hold all nations together. It holds out the only hope for the survival of humanity in an age whicit has been threatened more and more by man's own inventions of modern weaponry and technology. I feel the United Nations holds the human touch that should always remind us that  in the final analysis  this Organization was established to permit the pursuit of human happiness for all peoples."
"122",6251,"SLE",41,1986,"It is an honor for roe  on behalf of the delegation of Sierra Leone  to extend to the President our congratulations on his election to preside over the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-first session. Assured  as we are  of the commitment of his great country  Bangladesh  to the noble ideals of this Organization  and given his own personal qualities as a statesman and diplomat of distinction  we have every confidence that he will guide the deliberations at the forty-first session to a successful conclusion.We would also register our appreciation and gratitude to his distinguished predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies of Spain  who successfully presided over the historic and truly memorable fortieth session.As we commence the fifth decade of our Organization's existence we continue to face enduring threats to international peace and security. The continued accumulation of massive nuclear and conventional arsenals  the persistence of terrorism within States and across State frontiers  inter-State aggression with sophisticated weaponry and massive forces  and the continued polarization of the world into ideological and military blocs have consistently raised the specter of a dangerous world on the brink of catastrophe. Despite the endless speeches and the numerous resolutions of this Assembly  peace remains a dream and a faint hope to the peoples of Central America  parts of Africa  Kampuchea  Afghanistan and the Middle East. For many  parochial and selfish national interests remain the corner-stone of policy and international behavior contrary to the principles of our Organization  the pleas and supplications of concerned humanity and simple ethical rules of conduct.Perhaps nowhere else today are those ethical principals more violated  nowhere else the conscience of humanity more called into question and nowhere else urgent action more demanded than in South Africa. The tragedy of South Africa continues to be perpetuated with painful consistency. Never in the course of politicalhistory has a regime been so utterly callous and insensitive to the fundamental rights and needs of the majority of its citizens.In view of the sensitivity and importance of this issue and the increasing urgency with which the international community must now deal with South Africa  permit me to deal a little extensively with the subject.The evil character of the South African regime is vividly portrayed in the report of the Commonwealth Group of Eminent Persons on South Africa  which made the following observation about apartheid:■As a contrivance of social engineering  it is awesome in its cruelty. It is achieved and sustained only through force  creating human misery and deprivation and blighting the lives of millions.""While much of the world is in agreement about the abhorrence of that regime  some controversy still exists about how to deal with it. Because of South Africa's proven aversion to reason over several decades of negotiations with it  the great majority of the international community is now firmly convinced that one of the few remaining options for ending apartheid and the atrocities it embodies is the imposition of effective comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against that regime.It is regrettable  however  that after several years of intense efforts by the international community the struggle against apartheid is still in a state of ferment  not due so much to credible resistance by South Africa to international pressures as to the apparent existence of a conspiracy by a section of the international community which  for mostly cynical reasons  has directly or indirectly undermined those pressures.Those collaborators with apartheid have spawned dozens of reasons for their reluctance to fulfill their obligation under the United Nations Charter and as members of the human race. We have been told  for example  that the imposition of comprehensive sanctions against South Africa is immoral assuch sanctions impose hardships on the lives of ordinary people  in particular black people  and that in any case sanctions could not bring about the desired political changes in southern Africa as they have historically been proven to be ineffective in these circumstances. At other times we are told that South Africa has already embarked upon a process of significant political change and that sanctions could only scuttle that process.It would hardly have been worth the time and effort for me to attempt to rebut those fallacies had they been confined to the traditional fringes of society. In the circumstances it has to be pointed out that whatever adverse effects sanctions might have on the oppressed people of South Africa  such effects would pale into insignificance when compared to the immorality of apartheid. Therefore to choose for the South African people the immorality of apartheid over the so-called immorality of sanctions is not only logically absurd but morally indefensible. Predictably  the oppressed people of South Africa have shown their content for such faulty reasoning and hypocritical concern by overwhelmingly supporting the call for sanctions  the effects of which upon them could make very little difference to their already subhuman existence.The effects of sanctions on South Africa can be gauged from the paranoia with which the South African Government is reacting to the issue and the elaborate machinery it is now assembling to circumvent them. Recently South Africa's Manpower Minister  Pieter du Plessis  gave Archbishop Desmond Tutu what he called a friendly warning that the Archbishop's calls for sanctions against South Africa bordered on ""high treason"". Not too long ago the head of the South African Reserve Bank  Dr. Gerhard Kock  after reporting a one billion dollar capital outflow from South Africa in the first half of this year  explained that perceived threats of intensified economic sanctions and news of continued social unrest were the main factors behind the outflow.Those who try to justify apartheid by arguing that Africans in South Africa and Namibia are better off than their counterparts in other African countries succeed only in deluding themselves. The rest of us know that in Namibia  for instance  while the per capita income for whites is estimated at over $8 009  the average income for Africans  who constitute 92 per cent of the population  is only $188. A recent survey by the Carnegie Foundation revealed that the incidence of disease associated with malnutrition among rural blacks in South Africa is among the world's highest and that nearly half of the black population lives below the minimum subsistence level. In addition  the South African journalist Donald Woods  in a study for the Commonwealth secretariat  calculates that South African blacks are materially worse off than citizens in at least 12 other African countries. And all this is happening in one of the world's richest countries.We also know that in July this year  after a South African court overturned part of the emergency decree imposed by the regime. Prime Minister Botha simply issued an executive order annulling the Court's ruling  making nonsense of any argument that South Africa offers a vision of judicial liberty unparalleled on the continent.My delegation wishes to reiterate its conviction that the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa is now necessary. In doing so  I do not intend to underestimate the size of the resources required for such an undertaking in terms of fighting sanctions-breaking activities as well as ensuring that the front-line States are provided adequate assistance by the international community to enable them withstand South Africa's reprisals.Namibia presents one of the most glaring examples of South Africa's violation of international law and our Organization's inability to uphold its own legal prescriptions. Aside from this  Namibia's independence is further delayed by unjustifiably linking it with the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola. It must be clear to all by now that the presence of Cuban troops in Angola is entirely the sovereign decision of the Government of Angola  which is free to formulate and pursue its own independent foreign policy objectives and work out its own national destiny. The withdrawal of Cuban forces is a matter for the Governments of Angola and Cuba  and we believe that this process can only begin when Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  on Namibia  is implemented and the threat to the internal and external security of Angola is eliminated. Meanwhile  the struggle for Namibian emancipation from colonialism and illegal occupation will go on under the sole and authentic leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and the support of concerned nations.The question of Western Sahara and the continuing stalemate can only be brought to a final conclusion through negotiation. In the light of this  we wish to echo the call for the withdrawal of foreign troops and a referendum on the Territory  in order to give the people of Western Sahara the opportunity to work out their destiny. It is in this respect that we restate and reaffirm our support for General Assembly resolution 40/50  on Western Sahara  as offering the desired and appropriate process for a peaceful resolution of the problem.The impasse that now exists in the Middle East peace process is a consequence of the aggression against the Palestinian people and the denial of their right to a homeland. That situation can persist only at the cost of the continued suffering of the Palestinian people under occupation and mistreatment and the risk of another outbreak of hostilities in the region. We consider any efforts based on a policy of extracting unreasonable concessions from the Palestinian people to contain no prospects of yielding enduring stability. Similarly  the policy of substituting unrepresentative Palestinians for the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole authentic representative of the Palestinian people  as negotiating partners is short-sighted and succeeds only in further clouding the prospects for peace in the region.Along with the vast majority of the international community  we condemn the cruel Israeli practices in the occupied Palestinian territories and urge the occupying authorities to take an enlightened view of their need for security by recognizing that an oppressive and cruel neighbor never endears himself to anyone.My delegation continues to oppose the presence of foreign troops in Kampuchea and regrets that previous appeals by this Assembly in numerous resolutions for the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from that country have not been heeded.We pay a tribute to the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea for significantly furthering the peace process by presenting in March this year an eight-point peace plan for a political settlement of the Kampuchean problem. In reaffirming our solidarity with the people of Kampuchea in their struggle for self-determination  we urge that the other parties to the conflict participate in discussions cm the implementation of the eight-point peace plan  which has already won substantial support.The solution to many of today's world problems and the enhancement of peace and security cannot be achieved with passionate slogans  pious and self-righteous speeches and tiresome resolutions  many of which have remained unimplemented. The people of South Africa  Namibia  Western Sahara  Afghanistan  Palestine  Kampuchea and the Koreas  the representatives of the last of which should be sitting here with us  are sick and tired of these. They need action  and  as we enter the fifth decade of our Organization's existence  we can enhance its credibility by the decisive measures we bring to bear on the crises that threaten peace  security and socio-economic progress. But what we see in our time is that certain States  in pursuit of their separate interests  are not doing much to ensure the success of our Organization and further the progress of the rest of the human community.The problems of our Organization are further compounded by the fact that only a year after we reaffirmed our faith and continued support for it  the United Nations is facing a grave financial situation. The Secretary-General has reacted courageously and promptly to that crisis  a report on which was submitted  discussed and partially acted upon at the resumed session of the fortieth General Assembly in May this year. Such action appropriately sets the tone and the mode for the extensive and detailed discussion necessary for an accurate diagnosis and solution of the Organization's problems. My delegation acknowledges in an equally hopeful spirit  the report of the Group of 18 on the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations. The report requires careful study to ensure that the broadest possible consensus is reached on its reconsiderations.Over 12 years ago the Assembly  disturbed by the growing disparities between the rich and the poor  proclaimed a new international economic order. The hesitations and prevarications which have since attended its implementation have undermined the efforts of our institution to reduce the widening gap. Many developing countries  including Sierra Leone  remain particularly vulnerable to unpredictable external economic forces. Our era is one that requires sustained reflection  a frank and hottest analysis and the combined efforts of all the human and technological resources at our disposal if we are to provide a solution to the unprecedented economic crisis that still besets our nations.In spite of appreciable shifts in perception among the major industrialized countries  the socio-economic situation in Africa remains precarious and disturbing. The fact that many African Governments have revised their policies and reformulated strategies and programs should not invite complacency on the part of the international community. The present crisis is largely attributable to fundamental structural problems which can be rectified only by sustained  long-term  growth-oriented adjustment programs. This requires several years of coherent  sustained and well-co-ordinated action  appropriately initiated at the national level and receiving the ungrudging co-operation of the international community and particularly  the support of the major financial institutions. Indeed  the shortage of liquidity and inadequate financial resource flows to many developing countries have both contributed to disturbing levels of poverty and deprivation. We have no doubt that some of the traumatic incidents associated with famine and food shortages in Africa must be attributed essentially to the basic constraints of inadequate and ineffectual resource flows. For our part  my Government has adopted and is pursuing programs for rehabilitation and economic recovery  and in order to accelerate their implementation it has gone a long way  and has bent over backwards  to reach an accommodation and understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). That is not an easy process. It runs the risk of instability for any Government that attempts to operate within a framework which is unacceptable to the majority of its people. In accommodating IMF conditions  one can undermine democracy. In that connection  we believe that the major industrialized countries should have the vision to offer greater  more reliable  constant and effective assistance without very harsh conditions whose implementation can cause severe hardship. The special session on the critical economic situation in Africa  which convened here in the spring  identified some areas for priority action  and we believe that tha international community must support our efforts to achieve meaningful  effective and sustainable development.The funds required to support and implement the program of Action over the next five years are substantial  and Africa first and foremost  whit the international community in support  must renew its commitment to achieving economic recovery and development. In that connection  a positive and sympathetic approach by the international community to the persistent and pervasive question of external debt can have significant effects on prospects for future development.Some of our partners in development  by canceling substantial debts accruing as a result of our implementing programs for infrastructure investment  have shown the way to others. Debt relief  judiciously and appropriately applied  eases economic and financial constraints  offers the recipient some respite and  properly handled  improves the prospects for recovery and rehabilitation. The United Nations has over the years stood the test of time  in spite of difficulties which sometimes challenge its usefulness  without a shadow of doubt  it has become the only medium through which peace and security can be assured. Although the complexities of international relations today make the Organization's task  sometimes insurmountable  the successes achieved  with the determination  skill and perseverance of the Secretary-General  staff and Member States  have outweighed the frustrations and disappointments.No nation  no matter how small  can in splendid isolation be master of its fate  but equally  no nation  no matter how great  can compel all others to do its bidding nor convert them by vigorous persuasion to its own beliefs. All nations are interdependent in terms of politics  economics and strategy. The United Nations is a guarantor of that eternal truism.Once again the delegation of Sierra Leone solemnly renews its faith in the noble ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and its endeavors to pursue the objective of a peaceful  stable and progressive world."
"123",6297,"SLV",41,1986," I wish to convey to the President my warmest congratulations on having undertaken the highest office of the forty-first regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  and we wish the President every success in this endeavor  we are convinced that under his wise guidance the General Assembly will be able to find formulas of understanding which will undoubtedly contribute to a solution of the international problems we will be discussing here.Similarly  let me convey a special word of gratitude for the praiseworthy and arduous work of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose dedication to the cause of peace and international co-operation deserves the firm and unreserved support of all the Member States of the Organization.Today I bring to the Assembly a message from a heroic people who have learned  among many other things  how to listen to others  but who today call on those others in an appeal for understanding of their own problems.This is the odyssey of a people  of a Government and its leader  and of an army which at a given point in its history decided  with epic courage  to put behind it the dark night of dictatorship and oppression.El Salvador would like to tell its story once again and ask the world for its understanding  an understanding which could provide the strong encouragement  which it needs to press on with determination along the stony path towards full democracy and well-being of the community. Blood  tears and sorrow have been the path we were fated to travel in order to win our final freedom through pluralism and social justice. And the higher the price that has to be paid  the more determined must be our effort  and the more firmly entrenched the result of that effort.El Salvador  after six years of democratic revolution  is now irresistibly breaking through the barriers of misunderstanding and moving with a sure step towards the consolidation of the essential bases of a society with greater justice  equality  solidarity and participation.This process  which em incomprehensible fate has decreed must be so painful  requires us to make an anguished appeal for the full understanding of this august Assembly  which I am sure will never deny its recognition to the peoples who are prepared to sacrifice their lives for peace.El Salvador has changed. Even when Jose Napoleon Duarte first took over as President  we were aware of the great efforts and sacrifices that would be needed to develop a democracy in the particular conditions prevailing in El Salvador. Because of this  we set up a political framework that reflected the expectations of our people  so long frustrated.We were always aware of the tremendous difficulties involved in this project  because the strategy had to be pursued within an existing framework of radical social conflict that polarized the various forces and groups  because of the conditions of injustice and socio-economic marginalization involved in the structural crisis. Therefore  we drew up the general plan of government which was in fact a doctrinaire and pragmatic response to the problems of El Salvador  based on five main objectives that served as the starting point in securing the national unity we seeded to overcome the crisis. These goals are: humanization  pacification  democratization  participation and the recovery of the national economy. As far as democratization is concerned  the Government has in fact become the catalyst and generator of change by developing institutions that promote the stability and cohesion of our society. In that they represent new channels for the expression of the ideas  aspirations and demands of the different social groups. But democracy thus described is a cold concept  devoid of value  because any government could say that it is committed to undertaking a process of this nature and scope  without being able to list any specific achievements.Our case is different. We have opened up  without any reservation  without any false pretexts  the very heart of our country to hundreds of international observers during the four sets of elections which took place in 1982  1984 and 1985 with respect to these events. Those observers have in fact given unimpeachable testimony as to the legitimacy and integrity of those elections.A few days ago we realized one of the greatest hopes of our people; the establishment of a reliable  autonomous and definitive electoral process which will  in fact  ensure the democratic ideal. Our people can therefore be sure of being able in future to express their will freely at the polls and we are convinced that democracy will thus be strengthened as the electoral process is improved.As history has shown us repeatedly and dramatically  democracy must achieve its truest meaning  going beyond the political and embracing all the various aspects of national life. One cannot  for example  ignore the fact that without justice  without a new law in keeping with new circumstances  democracy cannot be achieved. For this reason we are carrying out a thorough judicial reform for which special committees based on the will of the majority are working hard on draft reforms of the national codes. One of these  the labour code  is now almost ready for promulgation. Responding to the present-day demands for justice and participation  it ascribes a proportional distEibution of profits between employers and workers  thus creating a climate of equity and understanding.Similarly  no effort would meet with support if it did not provide a material basis for the well-being of Salvadorian society: that is  the land and those who work it. Today  our farmers - those anonymous ones who shape our real hopes - can  by virtue of this labor code  form trade unions freely and enjoy their collective rights to the full. Indeed  the farmers trade union movement has always been essential for our historical design. A new democracy would have no meaning unless it drew on our past  and on the genesis of our conflict  that is  the obsolete former land regime  the eternal cause of misunderstanding and injustice in theWith legitimate pride I can say to the international community that we have been able to satisfy the expectations of our people and of history because theagrarian reform which was undertaken only six years ago  and which was one of the most deep-rooted in the history of America  has achieved its main objective. In the first two phases 40 per cent of the best land has been passed over to co-operatives and small landowners. This means that now more than 700 000 Salvadorians are enjoying a real redistribution of the agrarian wealth  with a complete restructuring of the tenancy system.But in order for this redistribution to be more effective and fair  based on a criterion of true participation  a co-operative solidarity fund has been established to ensure that all of the sector that has been reformed may participate  with the net gains  in the financing of any co-operatives that are not financially viable or may undertake special projects.It is impossible to imagine that a reform as comprehensive and innovative as this  in a system of imperfect structures  would not have great problems and inadequacies  but we are convinced that with the patience of our people  with the determination of our Government  and with the technical and economic co-operation of the international community  this noble and just project  which represents a key element in our new democratic revolution  will operate better day by day and will achieve its high goal. It is important to state that this support and assistance are particularly necessary because  in accordance with our Constitution  the third and last phase of this reform will be implemented next January. Under it  no individual can hold more than 250 hectares.El Salvador has changed. In El Salvador the democratization of credit has enabled thousands of workers in the city to gain free access to line of credit on the land. It is now possible to ensure that credit is not simply held in the hands of a few banking systems. We have thus been able to strengthen the new agrarian system by redistribution of credit.In the midst of a serious financial crisis  the result of this costly conflict  we are now valiantly undertaking economic reform. This involves the modernization of the static structures of our economy  making them more dynamic and in keeping with the new situation  in which the State plays an appropriate role with regard to the economic situation to protect the majority and to ensure the welfare of all the people of El Salvador.In this democratic concept of participation there must be very firm control of basic commodity prices  the maintenance of low-interest rates and credits for low-income housing  with a complementary law for the renting of housing. These are all different aspects which have been ensured at present. To this we must add that three successive salary increases have been given to public workers and thousands of small- and medium-term projects have been undertaken in the semi-urban areas  for the poorer sectors  the farmers and workers. The national plan for recovery in the economic and social sphere  uniting all of the Salvadorian peoples in a patriotic effort  will keep us united in the work of reconstruction. The magnitude of this effort on the part of the Government must be recognized  account being taken of the serious financial difficulties posed by its present structure.These reforms  together with the administrative and cultural reforms  are proof of the fact that El Salvador is fighting to consolidate a specific pattern of democratic revolution  as opposed to totalitarian Marxism and liberal individualism  which do not meet the demands of a community and a free society.In this same spirit of participation  in the economic sphere  we are also setting up a tax reform to ensure a better distribution of the tax burden on the stronger economic sectors. This has been achieved through indirect elimination of taxation and on the other hand by levying a tax on net capital and superfluous and luxury goods. This will ensure a fairer system in which all Salvadorians willshare  in accordance with their means  the costs of the present conflict. We are thus  little by little  creating a climate conducive to ensuring that the private business sector may contribute to the economic recovery.It is true that employers do play a very important role in the economic and social sphere. It is also true that all Salvadorians must contribute in making the sacrifices and efforts that are essential for social justice and to overcome this inhuman conflict in which we are involved.In this respect  we make an appeal to the private sector of El Salvador for them to set aside their doubts  reticence and prejudices and to heed the call of their country  to follow the course of development  knowing that their efforts will redound to the benefit of democracy.El Salvador has changed. It is  therefore  a matter of great sorrow to us that this revolution towards freedom  which we are experiencing daily with blood and pain  should be misunderstood and often criticized by certain Governments  like those of Cuba and Nicaragua. They have set themselves up as gratuitous detractors of our actions. They do not consider the fact that for decades the former has been keeping its people under the iron yoke of a one-party total and cruel dictatorship  while the other  unfortunately  is following the same path.It is sometimes difficult to understand how impossible it is for the international system to act with a greater sense of justice for all since no one can fail to see that these Governments have made themselves creditable oy having a ""special reporter"" on human rights  whereas these human rights are being blatantly and permanently violated.El Salvador has changed. We believe that we must have a system based on the will of the majority  a system that inspires and encourages true freedom for thehuman person  for without it there cannot be democracy. It is thus that my Government is determined to promote democracy  with full and unrestricted freedom of expression  a freedom lived and exercised daily by all the institutions in my country that enjoy this inalienable right.The Government of El Salvador  presided over by Mr. Jose Napoleon Duarte  is promoting respect tor and fulfillment of human rights. It is in this sensitive area that my country has made the greatest progress. It is important also to highlight the progress made in the military sector. Tremendous efforts have been made to make our army more technical and more professional. We now have an armed force which plays an important role in ensuring harmony and understanding among the people of El Salvador. It is important also to mention the specific efforts made in this area which have made it possible to punish all forms of abuse of authority or any other type of indiscriminate violence. Six hundred and thirty seven arrests have been made of members of the armed forces brought to trial for various offenses committed against the people.On the other hand  in the case of political assassinations  figures are clearly falling  if one bears in mind that in 1986 this represented only 2 per cent compared to the figures for 1980. Those figures cannot in the main be attributed either directly or presumably to any elements in the armed forces.On the contrary  the people of El Salvador have seen with sorrow and astonishment terrorist acts carried out by elements of the Revolutionary Democratic Front Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation  which sometimes included the destruction of telephone exchanges  machine-gun attacks on public transport  the burning of coffee stocks  the massive destruction of power pylons and  above all  the inhuman placing of mines designed to mutilate their victims' lower limbs  particularly among humble peasants working the land  who unfortunately are those most often hit by this form of violence  which has also often killed their children.This shows the degree of despair of the guerilla network and also explains the many desertions from the ranks of the guerilla movement and its loss of all popular and international support  and explains why it is heading for a historic defeat.We hope that the Special Rapporteur  in his next report on human rights  will reflect the tremendous increase in the number of desertions from the guerilla movement  the deserters having joined the democratic process. Together with the numbers captured  they are received and well treated in all phases of rehabilitation  which clearly shows that these groups are rapidly crumbling; they are assured at all times of full respect for their fundamental rights by the armed forces.However  we do not ignore the fact that there are mistakes and problems but we have shown that we are determined to overcame them and to ensure that this conflict which has been imposed upon our people will be fully humanized.El Salvador has changed. My Government views with concern the attitude adopted with regard to the situation in respect of human rights in El Salvador  particularly by certain international governmental or non-governmental bodies  which are induced by certain Governments or groups which seem constantly to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic institutions  thus favoring the strategic policy of the rebel groups in my country. My country has spared no effort to achieve peace and justice and therefore it would welcome more equitable treatment by this body with regard to the progress achieved in my country with regard to human rights and fundamental liberties. We therefore hope that a more understanding attitude will be adopted  in keeping with the efforts we are undertaking at present. I would even say  with all due respect  that my country has considered that in view of the sincere measures adopted in this area the continuing presence of the Special Rapporteur is in fact a heavy burden for our country and it would be fairer if his mandate were not renewed.El Salvador has changed. He believe that there can be no peace without democracy and no social justice without peace. The peace-making process must provide the necessary room for political freedom in which all sectors may participate in the business of the State and society without recourse to violence so as to allow differences to be overcome in the context of a frank democratic dialog. My Government believes that peace does not simply mean reaching an agreement to settle a dispute. Peace- is not simply the absence of armed conflict. It has a deeper meaning. Peace means a guarantee of security for man fully to achieve his dignity autd enjoy eternal values. Peace means respect for and recognition of the rights of others as an essential requisite in order to unite our efforts to overcome problems and challenges in a constructive way.In this Assembly the President of the Republic  Mr. Jose Napoleon Duarte  two years ago offered the rebels a peace proposal based on a frank and rational dialog which would ensure the stability of the democratic process by including those groups into the social process within the framework of our Constitution  which clearly provides for democracy and political pluralism on the broadest basis. That initiative  which was set out in a frankly democratic way  was clearly demonstrated in the two rounds of talks  held in La Palma and Ayagualo in October and November 1984. However  those meetings opened our eyes to the fact that for the rebel groups constitutional dialog was a tactic made use of for purely propagandists purposes aimed at frustrating the expectations of peace and democracy of the people of El Salvador. They merely pretended to seek a political solution to the conflict.During his official visit in May this year to the Contadora Support Group countries  namely Argentina  Brazil  Peru and Uruguay  he offered amnesty and safety to the rebels in exchange for a clear-cut public demonstration of their willingness to renounce violence and war as a means of achieving power. Despite the rigid attitude of the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation-Revolutionary Democratic Front  my Government has supported and will continue to support the process of dialog  because it forms part of the basic concept of order  society and life from which we draw inspiration as a democratic Christian nation. Not only has this been nationally and internationally accepted as a viable process but  furthermore  a great number of members of the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation-Revolutionary Democratic Front have of their own free will reincorporated themselves into a society thus showing that they reject violence and have adopted the principles and values of western democracy.In his presidential message to the nation on 1 June this year  President Duarte proposed a third round of talks which would show this unshakable political will on the part of the Government to find a democratic solution to the conflict on the basis of that frank understanding and sense of responsibility which has characterized our President. He has thus fulfilled the commitment he made in this Assembly Hall. However  those who took up arms have in fact adopted an intransigent position by demanding the withdrawal of the army to an area of three hundred square kilometers. They wanted to give the impression that the zone was under their control  which would enable them  at the international level  to demand recognition  but this was  of course  totally illusory. Seeing their pretensions frustrated  they simply canceled the meeting in spite of the guarantees and safeguards which the Government had offered them  as on previous occasions.This showed the historical illegitimacy of the Revolutionary Democratic Front - Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation - and once again demonstrated the undeniable legitimacy of the Government of El Salvador  which has brought about an unprecedented increase in its ability internationally to act both passively and actively  precisely because of the support of its people and the firm  sincere  modest and honest way in which President Duarte has set out the terms and aims of his political program  the Government's program and tine national thesis of dialog.My Government remains firmly determined to exhaust every possibility of dialog as the only way to ensure peace on our national soil. That position which is the result of the national consensus  can count on the full support of obedient  unquestioning armed forces  as was clearly recognized in the message to the nation of the Military High Command on 19 September.As a member of the international community  El Salvador has to deal with a heterogeneous structure characterized by the existence of opposition and dissent in an atmosphere of ideological  political  economic and social confrontation in which the variables of the correlation of forces and world domination become the factors that determine international relations.This is because the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  the equality of sovereignty of those States  renunciation of the use or threat of force and co-operation in the development of all peoples constitute today more than ever before the fundamental principles of El Salvador's foreign policy  which is rooted in good faith and respect for and compliance with treaties.But unless complemented by the promotion and defense of democracy  respect for human rights and identification of the specific elements of our internal policy  those principles would be of no value at all to El Salvador's present and futuregenerations. It is only logical therefore that El Salvador's foreign policy should reflect the principles  purposes  and requirements of our internal policy.This enables us to define and establish our strategy on the basis of three fundamental aspects: legitimacy  by virtue of the origin of the Government and the processes it has developed to defend and consolidate it; neutrality  because we do not intervene in the affairs of other sovereign States and we respect the self-determination of peoples; and democracy  because we associate ourselves with and support  in full solidarity authentic democracies that are free  pluralistic  participatory and based on Western Christian concepts.Within that very clear-cut framework the aims and means indispensable for achieving peace stand out clearly and are seen in their true dimensions both regionally and internationally  and are implicit in our foreign policy.Thus our profound democratic  pacifist vocation and the zeal we have always shown to ensure respect for and promote the fundamental rights and freedoms of all peoples determines our vigorous condemnation of the South African regime for its continuing inhuman  segregationist practice of apartheid and its evil efforts to extend it to other  neighboring States.We recommend and demand that honest and sincere dialog and negotiations must be initiated and pursued exhaustively as the best way of finding solutions to the problems of the Middle East  Lebanon and Korea. In this regard my Government recognizes that the formula suggested by South Korea for the reunification of Korea contains positive and useful bases for the gradual achievement of that goal.As for the regional aspects of our foreign policy  my Government considers that although it is true that the Central American crisis stems from a system of obsolete structures that no longer meet the people's need and expectation of political participation and development  the cold climate of East-West confrontation has also had an impact on its development.No one can doubt that the lack of appropriate mechanisms for the solution of regional problems has also contributed to the establishment of a situation of increasing failure to respect the principles and norms of international law.We therefore believe that there is a political  diplomatic  security and legal vacuum in Central America  and that it must be filled in order to ensure the adoption of measures and procedures capable of preventing internal and external destabilizing action against our democracies.Accordingly  the Government of El Salvador has maintained a position of total and determined support for the work of the Contadora Group  since we believe that that is the best possible way to fill the vacuum  and strengthen the principles that can lead to comprehensive  simultaneous  regional  multilateral and verifiable agreements that will undoubtedly bring about the re-establishment of peace  security  democracy and continuing development.From the beginning of the Contadora initiative my Government made clear its firm political desire for a peaceful solution to the regional crisis and to subscribe to its willingness to the Contadora Act. My Government has declared internationally that the Act is a unique  definitive  irreplaceable and guaranteed document. It is untrue because it alone can ensure peace  pluralist democracy  security and economic and social development. It is definitive because it results from an overall Latin American effort within a process of serious negotiation and was approved by consensus. It is irreplaceable because it is historically legitimate and its mechanisms are practical and sure. And it is guaranteed because of its credibility and the universal support it enjoys.However  the final version of the Contadora Act on Peace and Co-operation in Central America  which was presented to our Government on 7 June last  does not cover the conditions or recruitments agreed upon for its adoption and ratification in accordance with the commitment entered into by the five countries by virtue of the Document of Objectives of September 1983  which stated  inter alia:""To stop the arms race in all its forms and begin negotiations for the control and reduction of current stocks of weapons and on the number of armed troops."" (S/16041  p. 5)He must not forget that in view of the seriousness of the Central American situation  all agreements and commitments altered into must be fulfilled  particularly those governing political aspects  because that is the fundamental condition of the success of the Contadora initiative. I must also reiterate the need to guarantee the efficiency of the mechanisms of implementation and follow-up concerning verification and control of the political commitments in the Document of Objectives.Finally  faithful to its democratic  peace-loving vocation. El Salvador appeals to the Contadora Group to redouble its efforts to persuade Nicaragua to abide by the consensus formula and the understanding to be adopted in the region. It will not be possible to continue this action if Nicaragua fails to demonstrate the clear political will and readiness to enter into  respect and comply with the commitments assumed under the Contadora Act.For our part  we have given the clearest proof of good faith and our undeniable wish for the internationalization of the dialog and democracy in the region  as an alternative to the internationalization of the conflict. El Salvador has presented to the international community the ""Contadora Doctrine""  which sets out the noble aspiration of the Central American countries to keep the dark specter of dictatorship out of the region for ever. Thus we clearly show the legitimate and independent nature of El Salvador's foreign policy and our enduring faith in multilateral dialog.El Salvador has changed. Therefore  with all the confidence that my Government commands  I call upon Nicaragua to change its incongruous attitude which will disrupt the regional dialog and negotiations initiated by Contadora and Esguipulas by actions designed to resolve the regional conflict bilaterally  but which could never lead to a negotiated  simultaneous  multilateral  verifiable solution such as has been proposed by the Contadora Group. Similarly  I must urge the Nicaraguan Government to show a clear indication of good will at the regional level  ceasing to provide  in flagrant violation of international law  a permanent sanctuary for those who wish to bring about -subversion in El Salvador and internationally.The deterioration in the subregional situation makes it imperative that the Central American countries create regional institutions  and revitalize existing ones  to complement the work of the Contadora Group and allow us  the people of Central America  to find consensus solutions to our own problems  through a realistic recognition of existing factors tending towards unity or divergence.In that spirit. El Salvador is contributing actively to the setting up a Central American parliament  conceived of as a deliberating forum where it will be possible to discuss and draw up agreements on the problems facing us  one which could eventually serve as a mechanism to follow up  verify and control any agreement that the Central American countries may enter into.Nobody can deny that we have given a clear indication of the political will to remove the Central American problem from the East-West confrontation  since El Salvador was the first to ratify the treaty of co-operation between the European Economic Community and the Central American countries  because we believe that improving the interregional dialog will contribute greatly to removing the extremes of world interests in the area.As a well-known South American leader has said ""The success of the blossoming Latin American democracy depends on its capacity to resolve the great economic and social problems of our time."" My Government is aware that the internal structural imbalances of the developing countries are brought about largely by the persistence of unjust international economic relations. In addition to the high cost of servicing the external debt  our countries are increasingly dependent on world centers. That dependence in turn makes a significant contribution to the imbalance in our economies  reflected in a growing socio-political instability  which besides worsening the quality of life of our peoples attacks the foundations of our democratic processes.Many of our countries have now carried out the greatest economic readjustment possible. That has meant a high cost for us in social terms  because it has lowered productivity levels and created a fiscal imbalance between income and expenditure  making it very difficult to stabilize and revive the economy.In that situation it is essential to increase North-South co-operation. It must be based on justice and characterized by greater flexibility in the developed economies  which should support the structural changes in our countries  creating conditions of political  economic and social stability  and not the reverse.In his address to the Assembly a short time ago  the President of Costa Ricasaid:""Yesterday  they {the international banks] cared little that their money maintained the rule of despots. Today  they are not concerned with the suffering of those who pay in liberty."" (A/41/PV.9  p. 9-10) My Government urgently appeals to the Governments of the industrialized countries to understand that the worsening of the economic crisis in the poorer countries is contrary to their own interests  because it deprives vast sectors of mankind of the possibility of sovereignty and self-determination  leading them to feel utter desperation and bringing about a gradual split in the credibility of the democratic system as the ideal way of life  endangering its historic justification and  on the contrary  favoring other political systems already rejected by our peoples.Finally  we must not forget that  as His Holiness Pope Paul VI said.Government of El Salvador fully shares the concern cf the international community over the increase in terrorist acts  which are proliferating in various parts of the world and every day claim more innocent victims.The destruction of public property and the economic infrastructure  indiscriminate massacres  the taking of hostages and the placing of bomos in public places are characteristic of the behaviour of the terrorist groups that operate in my country. Having recognized the impossibility of gaining a political or military victory  they have had recourse to such acts to show  both internally and to the world at large  an apparent capacity for action  and at the same time to demoralizeMy Government repeats its readiness to commit itself completely to join in international measures to fight such a scourge  for no ideological or political cause can make it acceptable  understandable or justifiable that mankind should be threatened by such irrational behavior adopted by inhuman organizations that daily distance themselves further from civilization.It would be unfair to the historic perseverance of two brother peoples  which are striving together to attain common goals  if I did not stress today before the international community  as evidence of the peaceful will and vocation of our Governments  the complete fulfillment of the peace treaty between the Republics of El Salvador and Honduras  signed on 30 October 1980 in Lima  by which we agreed to put an end to the differences that had once separated us. On the basis of that treaty we have agreed to submit jointly for consideration by the International Court of Justice our border dispute - relating to land  islands and sea - as an example of our conviction that international differences and tensions must be overcome through adherence to the recognition of the principles of international The conversations and negotiations held to bring about that agreement  which was registered at the Organization yesterday  were held in a climate of friendship and mutual understanding  which contributed to a strengthening of the links of co-operation between El Salvador and Honduras.My country reaffirms its resolve to abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice on the border dispute  because we are convinced that law and justice will prevail in the decision of the highest international judicial body.Our Governments have also  with the co-operation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the support of the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration  drawn up a program to create the right conditions and the necessary trust for the repatriation of the Salvadorian refugees in Honduras to take place voluntarily  in a gradual  planned manner  allowing their resettlement in their various places of origin. That is an effort being made on the basis of the highly humanitarian approach that my Government has adopted towards the conflict that we are having to live with.El Salvador believes that the values of democracy and liberty are threatened by the accelerating arms race from which the world is suffering. It is impossible for the Governments of Central America to shoulder their historic responsibilities for the economic and social development of their peoples if they have to use their scarce resources to acquire large quantities of armaments for purely defensive reasons. Therefore  the Sandinista Government should renounce its concept of national security as involving a people in arms and the export of revolution  and should  on the contrary  accept  as we accept for ourselves  the establishment of limits on its present arsenal  which will make possible a balance between the forces in the region  as we have proposed in the Contadora Group.I wish now to refer to the crisis that is hampering the United Nations in its attempt to achieve the purposes behind its creation and to abide by its principles. Hy Government does not believe that the crisis is purely financial; it has deeper implications  to do with confidence in the Organization's ability to contribute to resolving the most pressing problems of our time. Therefore we are prepared to give our support to any initiatives which would lead to the restructuring of the Organization so as to enable it once again to carry out its functions effectively and once again be deserving of the confidence and trust placed in it by Member States.He should like to reiterate our appreciation for the work carried out by the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and we would certainly give our strong support to his re-election if that is his wish.There has been a change in El Salvador  and this brings me to make an urgent appeal to the international community  and particularly to all democratic countries of the world  to close ranks in the defense of the pluralistic and participatory democracy that is now being consolidated at the cost of great sacrifices in El Salvador and  through technical and financial co-operation  to protect it from the threat hanging over it owing to the lack of resources essential to ensure the economic  social and cultural well-being to which everyone living in a democracy aspires.We believe that one should not speak before thinking and that what one promises one should do. President Duarte and his Government are carrying out their promises; our Government knows how to govern. Hence we are sure that  after a long dark night of hatred and rancor  soon the dawn will break and all Salvadorians will proudly join in singing these lines of our national anthem that remind us that ""Peace in supreme happiness has always been El Salvador's noble dream; its achievement our constant goal; its preservation our greatest glory."""
"124",6369,"SOM",41,1986,"On behalf of «y delegation and on my own behalf I extend Ambassador Choudhury warm congratulations on his election as President of the forty-fir st session of the General Assembly. Our deliberations will undoubtedly profit from the learning  wisdom and diplomatic skills which he brings to his high office. I take this opportunity to express ny Government's gratification at the strong ties of friendship which link our two countries.I also wish to express our deep appreciation for the skillful guidance provided by Ambassador de Pinies of Spain during the fortieth session. His well-known diplomatic experience and statesmanship made a valuable contribution to a historic occasion.The consensus which emerged from the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations was that the world Organization  with all its faults  still represented mankind's best hope for peace and progress. That consensus  I believe  envisaged two lines of action: it called for the reform of those shortcoming typical of any 40-year-old bureaucracy  and it called for the strengthening of the central role of the United Nations in the system of collective security established by the Charter.The first line of action has been set in motion as a result of the efforts of the Group of high-level intergovernmental experts set up to review the administrative and financial functioning of the world body  My Government welcomes the recommendations of the Group as a valuable starting point for the process ofreform  and we believe that they should receive careful consideration. Where sensitive financial and budgetary issues are concerned  I trust that these can be addressed in a spirit of goodwill and with a consistent application of the relevant principles of the Charter  bearing in mind also the specific responsibilities ofthe Secretary-General.Unfortunately  the constructive response that has been made to the internal needs of the world Organization has not yet been Batched by efforts to strengthen its authority as it seeks to resolve problems which endanger world peace and security.Many of the political issues which trouble our times have their origin in the violation of two fundamental principles of the united Nations Charter - namely  the right of peoples to self-determination and independence  and respect for the humanrights of individuals.It is indeed tragic that many States are prepared to uphold Charter principles in situations where their countries are not directly involved  but ignore those same principles when they find it expedient to do so. There needs to be a renewed understanding of the fact that membership of the world Organization entails a sincere commitment to the rule of international law as established by the United Nations Charter and to the promotion of human dignity  on the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The United Nations has consistently promoted just and reasonable solutions  based on the principles of the Charter  in order to establish conditions of peace in numerous conflict areas of the world. Regrettably  these solutions remain implemented  and in consequence tension and conflict continue to take a heavy toll in human lives and constitute a setback to the search for stability and progress. International attention is today rightly focused on the critical situation in southern Africa  but more than 20 years ago the General Assembly called for comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions in order to deter South Africa's white minority from imposing its criminal apartheid plan on the black majority. We are now witnessing the inevitable confrontation between the oppressed majority  determined to regain its basic human rights at any cost  and the racist minority  prepared to use its oppressive police and military forces with the utmost brutality in order to retain its privileged position.Without doubt  violence and bloodshed will continue to escalate unless the Pretoria regime is pressured into abolishing apartheid  releasing imprisoned leaders such as Nelson Mandela and taking steps to establish a truly just and democratic society.My Government joins in the call for the imposition of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa  including an oil embargo - a call which is supported by a rising tide of public opinion around the world. We heartily welcome the growing recognition that this measure is the only peaceful and effective means available to prevent a protracted and bloody racial conflict in southern Africa.The demand for sanctions against South Africa is made even more urgent by the Pretoria regime's intransigence over Namibia's independence. In no other issue before the United Nations is the authority of the world body so clearly defined and at the same time so deeply compromised as in the case of Namibia. The importance of this question is attested to by the recently concluded special session of the General Assembly  the third on Namibia  which called once again for action under Chapter VII of the Charter. The special session could hardly have done otherwise in view of South Africa's continued illegal occupation of Namibia  its obstructive tactics against the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) andits policies of occupation  terrorist aggression  subversion and economic pressuredirected against front-line States.The Security Council has issued a great many ultimatums in the context of South Africa's gross violations of international law and its breaches of regional and international peace and security. I hope that the General Assembly will call upon the Council in a strong and unified voice to enforce those ultimatums.Another problem of international concern is the situation in the Horn of Africa. It is unfortunate that protracted conflict in the area has given rise to large-scale human suffering  massive destruction of property and huge refugee influxes. It is essential that concerted action be taken to remove the sources of tension and conflict and to establish a solid foundation for peace and stability in the region. To this end  it is imperative that confidence-building measures first be undertaken to create a climate conducive to meaningful negotiations on fundamental issues  based on respect for the human rights of the peoples of the area.The Middle East is among the world's most troubled areas  in spite of the fact that the principles which must govern a just and lasting settlement have been widely acknowledged. Peace in the area will continue to be elusive unless all those concerned exert the political will to bring about a comprehensive settlement.My Government fully supports the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council which call for the total withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  and the restoration of Palestinian rights in particular the right to statehood in Palestine.We believe that the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East would be a major step towards the achievement of a just and lastingpeace. Ho be effective the Conference would require the full participation cm a basis of equality of the representative of the Palestinian people  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PI0).It must be recognized that time is not on the side of peace in the Middle-East. Every effort must be made to ensure that a new generation will not again be handed a legacy of hatred and despair.The grave situation in Afghanistan and the attempt to suppress the freedom struggle of a courageous people continue to be a matter of major international concern. My Government strongly supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring about a political settlement based on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan  respect for its sovereignly and non-aligned status and the return of the Afghan refugees in safety and with honor.The proliferation of areas of conflict is clearly related to the low level of respect apparent on the international scene for principles of international law such as the peaceful settlement of disputes  non-interference in the affairs of States and the non-use of force in international relations. In this context  ray Government deeply regrets the escalation of the war between Iran and Iraq  which has resulted in great loss of life and destruction of the resources of both countries and has also endangered world peace and security. We join in the universal call for a sincere response to all efforts at mediation to achieve an immediate cease-fire and to promote a peaceful settlement of this tragic conflict.We also regret that the people of Kampuchea are still unable to determine their own future free from outside interference. The world community must continue to support regional and international efforts to establish independence  neutrality and peace for all the countries of South-East Asia.The world can ill afford the development in Central America of a new area of tension and conflict. The peace initiatives of the Contadora Group provide a valuable opportunity for settling problems through dialog and negotiation. That opportunity should not be lost.In a similar vein  we also join other States in supporting the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to find a peaceful solution to the long-standing question of Cyprus. If the mistakes and inequities of the past are to be avoided and a peaceful and harmonious future achieved for the two communities of Cyprus  there must be agreement on constitutional arrangements which would give equal rights to all the citizens of that State and provide the necessary protection and guarantees of those rights. It is our hope that the parties concerned will reach an understanding leading to an early and amicable settlement of the problem.Another regional concern of my Government is the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We hope that the Indian Ocean and hinterland States  the permanent members of the Security Council and the major maritime users will co-operate in efforts to convene the long-delayed Conference on the Indian Ocean before 1988. In our view  the convening of the Conference remains an essential step towards the attainment of the goals of the Indian Ocean Declaration.The critical economic situation on our continent continues to be foremost among the concerns of African States  even though the worst aspects of the crisis have been relieved.African Governments and peoples are deeply grateful for the generous response of the international community to the plight of millions made destitute by a combination of natural and man-made disasters. Innumerable lives have been saved and hundreds of thousands given hope for the future as a result of an extraordinary exercise of good will and co-operation by the United Nations and its agencies  governmental and charitable organizations and concerned groups and individuals.However  the task of shoring up our infrastructures and economies against future onslaughts by natural and other disasters must now be undertaken. That task demands the strong resolve of African States to rectify past mistakes in development planning and to shoulder the major responsibility for their economic growth. It also demands sustained flows of development assistance to provide an essential boost to rehabilitation efforts.Africa's priority program for economic recovery gives a clear indication of the determination of African States to take the steps necessary for recovery and steady growth. I hope that the adoption  by the General Assembly at the thirteenth special session  of the United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  indicates a new and constructive spirit of partnership between developed and developing countries in the task of Africa's rehabilitation.Each of Africa's most affected countries has its particular challenge in addition to the familiar constraints of underdevelopment. In Somalia we are doing all we can to combat drought and desertification both at the national and regional levels. It is for this reason that we contributed to the establishment of the Inter-governmental Authority for Drought and Development in East Africa.Somalia is of course affected on a catastrophic scale by the problem of massive refugee flows. International assistance ensures the survival of the refugees  but their continued presence in our country for almost a decade  of late by a new influx  has placed an intolerable burden on our overstretched resources and over-used environment.We appeal to donor countries to give renewed attention to the commitments made at the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa with regard to emergency assistance  medium-term needs and the search for durable solutions.Africa's plans for recovery and development  and indeed the development plans of all the developing countries  depend ultimately for their success on the reform of the imbalances in the world economic system and the creation of a world economic climate FavorFable to development.The debt burdens imposed by imported inflation are without doubt the most crippling of the many constraints which impede the development process. The call of the Organization of African Unity for an international conference on Africa's external indebtedness underlines the disastrous proportions of this problem. Clearly the gains of the thirteenth special session will be nullified unless creative solutions to the debt problem can be formulated.Narrowing the economic gap between developed and developing countries used to be an established goal of the United Nations but it is a goal that seems to be receding from sight. The abandonment of that goal would endanger the survival of millions of people in the developing world? it would have an adverse effect on world economic growth and it would be inimical to world peace and security. The resumption of vigorous efforts to narrow the gap between rich and poor countries would be in the best interests of all the members of the world community.Whatever the particular economic  political or social concerns of Member States may be  they all live under the threat of global disaster posed by the nuclear confrontation of the super-Powers. Unfortunately  the nuclear dilemma does not involve the security and status of the nuclear Powers alone: it involves the survival of civilization  of mankind and possibly of our planet. My Government hopes that the two super-Powers are at last prepared to talk to each other at the highest level and to make serious commitments to nuclear disarmament  to the prohibition of new weapons of mass destruction and to the preservation of outer space for peaceful purposes.In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm my Government's belief in the enduring validity of the principles and purposes of the United Nations We share the concern of many States over the emergence of a tendency to downgrade the importance of the world body and even to undermine its authority and effectiveness.Nevertheless  it has been demonstrated repeatedly  in both political and economic spheres  that even the critics of the United Nations are obliged to turn to it when other alternatives fail. If progress towards the resolution of political problems is often slow  the fault usually lies with a lack of political will to take advantage of United Nations peace-keeping and peace-making efforts. We would certainly have to consider the United Nations an indispensable instrument of progress and peace if we only took into account its remarkable achievements in the economic  social and humanitarian fields.In our complex world  limitless possibilities for the betterment of mankind exist side by side with dangerous regional and international tensions and with the threat of nuclear catastrophe. My Government will continue to do all it can to support the United Nations as it responds appropriately to the challenging problems of our times."
"125",6406,"STP",41,1986,"On behalf of the Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  I should like to express our best wishes for the success of the work of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. We bring with us a message of confidence in the United Nations  and the conviction that  today as in 1945  the Organization is the most complete expression of the hope of all peoples for a better world.""The United Nations for a better world"" was indeed the apposite theme chosen by the Assembly to mark the fortieth anniversary commemoration. Like all other anniversaries  that commemoration was a special occasion. By the high level of the delegations present and by their reaffirmation of their adherence to the Charter  irrefutable endorsement was provided for a mission and measures for which there has been no viable substitute or logical alternative in the turbulent world of the community of nations  which we represent here.Along with reaffirming its ideals  the General Assembly has also taken note of criticism by Member countries with regard to deficiencies in the modus operandi of the Organization. Although reaffirmation of adherence to the purposes andprinciples of the Charter and criticism of the united Nations are equally important for the life of the Organization  they carry different weight with us.Reaffirmation of the Organization's purposes and principles constitutes the fundamental  and most relevant  element of the equation  because renewed adherence to the ideals of the United Nations justifies and gives constructive meaning to the criticism. The criticism itself constitutes  and should be understood as  a commitment to the constant improvement of the Organization. In our view  the criticism should be understood and accepted as the right of each one of us  the Members of the Organization  as interested parties  because the United Nations expresses the will and collective action of its Member countries: any criticism is  after all  self-criticism.The General Assembly's adoption of resolution 40/237  by which it created the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations  constituted  in our opinion  the right step towards confronting the serious problems which the present financial crisis represents.We agree with those who urge us to face the fundamental causes of the crisis and draw attention to the absence of decisive political will as the essential problem. Nevertheless  recognition of such a need should not prevent us from facing the problem in its most>acute manifestations. The financial crisis is here and we need to deal with it now.A careful reading of the report submitted by the high-level Group of Experts is an unquestionable confirmation of our assertion. Beyond interests and intentions whose motivations we question  beyond hard-to-conceal measures which seek to subvert the fundamental principles of the Charter  beyond proposals whose efficacy we question as a viable alternative to the present situation  is the unquestionable fact that adjustments  reforms in methods and institutions  elimination of some practices and.procedures are all required.To maintain our status quo or limit the range and efficacy of the numerous recommendations included in the report in the name of questionable interests  would be  in our modest opinion  to fall short of our collective responsibility; it would be to put at risk our determination to reform the United Nations into an operative instrument for resolving the problems of our time.The measure of our success cannot be determined merely by the majorities we attain in the adoption of various resolutions or declarations  but rather by the impact and the actions such resolutions may have on the events which occur beyond the conference rooms of the United Nations.Thus  the necessary point of departure and the reference point for our deliberations should be the analysis of the effects that such decisions will have on those who will-sake their implementation possible - that is  the Member States and international public opinion We believe  for' example  that resolution 1514 (XV) exerted the historic influence that everyone is familiar with  not only because it corresponded to an aspiration shared by the great majority of world public opinion but also because there was a political will for action to put an end to colonialism.This relationship between our decisions and objective reality is  in our view  indispensable.The Assembly will recognize with us  however  that many of the resolutions we adopt here do not respect this relationship - hence they fail to be implemented.The fortieth session adopted  for example  some 353 resolutions covering areas as diverse as outer space and the sea-bed. I wonder how many countries were able to analyze those resolutions and the reference documents  let alone to begin the incrementation process of such measures.Talleyrand once said that everything that is excessive soon becomes meaningless. We need to ask ourselves the question whether such a great number of resolutions attains the goals to which we aspire. The responsibility for the increase in perennial questions in successive agendas of the United Nations is often attributed  implicitly if not explicitly  to the Member States which joined the Organization as a result of the decolonization process.We will say on this point that such a situation results from the legitimate exercise of the rights of each country. Secondly  it is important to keep in mind that as participants in a system of international relations characterized until our independence by relationships of dominance and injustice  it is legitimate for us to use the machinery provided in the Charter for the realization of those objectives which the Charter itself calls for.Our initiatives towards the process of decolonization  the establishment of a more just international economic order  and the progressive development of international law  to cite a few examples  all move in this direction.If we often repeat ourselves  and if many resolutions are no more than declarations of intent  this does not arise from the deliberate intention to act in this way  but rather from the lack of political will on the part of our partners in assuming their responsibilities under the Charter.We will refer to the question of Namibia as an example. After more than a decade of deliberations and decisions  it was to be expected that the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) would constitute the final stage in the solution to the Namibian question. To whom should we attribute the responsibility for the resolution  conferences and special sessions which took place after 1978? To the Member States which use every means to impose respect for the decisions of the United Nations or to those which are not in conformity with the duties and rights pledged in the Charter and the international community?Recognized as it is today that the arms race  especially in the nuclear sphere  puts the very existence of humanity in danger  in addition to diverting important human and financial resources so necessary to resolving present world problems  to whom should we attribute the responsibility for the deluge of resolutions adopted every year in the Assembly?On this subject  I should like to submit the following for the consideration of the majority that in the Assembly has made the adoption of such resolutions possible.The tenth special session  devoted to disarmament  adopted by consensus a Final Document containing a Declaration and Program of Action which established the basis of international disarmament aimed at general and complete disarmament under effective international control. While recognizing the difficulties and complexities of the negotiations and the legitimate concerns of the principal actors in this process  in truth the arms race continues on its course. To express our frustration arising .from our continued concern  we need at most two resolutions^ one to express our frustration  and the second to renew our appeal to the super-Powers.Not being participants in the arms race  let us not be participants in a ""resolution race"". Let us channel the limited resources of our Organization towards more productive aims  such as support for non-governmental organizations  which perform an active role in the mobilization of world public opinion  or support for research institutions in the disarmament area.We deliberately direct the attention of representatives to the problems confronting our Organization. We have reached this point for two reasons.The first rests on the importance and nature we think the general debate should assume in the context of our yearly meetings. We understand the statements made here  not as aids in themselves  but rather as a process of intercommunication meant to find the comprehension and understanding necessary to search for consensus and oriented towards common action.The second reason is based on the idea  accepted in diplomatic tradition  according to which countries have no permanent friends but rather permanent interests. It is the permanent interest of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe that the United Nations may effectively reach the objectives assigned to it by the Charter.A small island country whose greatest ambition is the attainment of the well-being and social progress of its. population and whose only aspiration is to share in the common destiny of the human race  we do not want to be part of  much less an instrument of  the policies of confrontation between politico-military blocs. He will not compromise our sovereignty or our dignity in dealings of any kind. We do not take part in ideological crusades of any nature whatsoever.We regard as the common heritage of the human race the scientific and social discoveries and advances under the various economic systems of our planet  and we claim the right freely and independently to adopt the various contributions of existing systems which are most in accordance with our reality and most conducive to the fulfillment of our aspirations.Geographically isolated  conditioned by a deliberate cultural isolation  condemned by the colonial system to a regime of mono-culture  we seek  in our privileged and historic relationship with the African Portuguese-speaking countries and the countries of the subregion of central Africa  the contours of our identity and the complementarities necessary to our development. Like other countries of the world  we desire open and advantageous collaboration which will provide us with the contributions necessary for the optimization of our resources and our potential. In any event  we are guided in our relations by strict respect for the Charter and the norms of international law which it legitimizes and inspires. This is the contribution which we think we can make towards the attainment of the objectives of the Charter  beyond our modest participation in those actions and activities which the Charter makes possible.We will not refer here to our serious concern over the conflicts in Western Sahara  East Timor  Afghanistan  Kampuchea  the Middle East  the Korean Peninsula  Cyprus and Central America. This is necessary because of constraints of time andbecause the analysis of such situations has already been made and the possible solutions have already been formulated. The only thing lacking is the political will to implement them. Furthermore  our positions will be shown in the voting process that will take place during the session. Nevertheless  I hope I may be permitted to refer in particular and briefly to the situation in southern Africa.An unprecedented consensus among the international community has been noted on this subject. After much hesitation  attempts at evasion aid dubious compromises on the part of certain members of the international community  today no one questions the need for mandatory sanctions against the racist South African regime or the fact that they are the last peaceful means available to compel the South African Government to dismantle the apartheid system  put an end to its illegal occupation of Namibia and terminate its direct or indirect attacks on the People's Republics of Angola and Mozambique  as well as on the other front-line States. We agree that the sanctions will  in some cases  have devastating effects on the region and on South Africa's own population. However  far from constituting a justification for the failure to apply sanctions  this should encourage the international community to take a more comprehensive  effective position. The responsibility does not end with the imposition of sanctions; quite the contrary. To ensure effectiveness  it is essential that measures of support for the neighboring countries be adopted simultaneously.In the name of the international community  whose ideals have been attacked  the front-line States  in a demonstration of courage and true internationalism  will accept the burden of the consequences which the effects of the sanctions and the economic might of South Africa will for their economies  already weakened by the economic crisis affecting the African continent.It is the duty of both developed and developing countries to transform our verbal solidarity into actions of concrete  co-ordinated and universal support.The Marshall Plan represented for Europe a response to Nazi devastation  and the countries of southern Africa need similar determined commitment by the international community. Only in this way will sanctions be an effective response and not just a fortuitous and inevitable political expedient.Civilized coexistence among nations presupposes that force will give way to agreements and negotiations and that relations among nations will be in accordance with the imperatives of the international legal order. If  historically  the use of force has been a means of resolving differences  controlling aggressive impulses or ensuring the victory of true ideals  the birth of the United Nations was intended to establish a new historic period characterized by rejection of the use of force as an instrument in carrying out certain policies. Even admission of the principle of the use of force in response to aggression was conditioned by and subordinated to the failure of all the peaceful measures outlined in the Charter.The structure built on the objective principles and Articles of the Charter signed in 1945 and the resulting development of international law which it inspired and enhanced were intended to initiate and project human coexistence free of the stigmas of war  whose devastating effects were experienced during the last world conflict and are being felt even today in several regions of the world.Do we forget nothing and learn nothing? Today let us affirm that indeed we forget nothing  but we learn what is essential. We shall not forget Woodrow Wilson's declaration. He said:""No nation should try to extend its power over any other nation or people  but  rather  every people should be free to determine its own destiny  its own way of development  without restraints  free from threat or fear  the small nations as much as the great and powerful ones.""We shall always bear in mind the essential idea expressed by John F. Kennedy before this Assembly in 1961:""Mankind must put an end to war  or war will put an end to mankind.* (A/PV.1013  para. 40)"
"126",6438,"SUR",41,1986," Allow me to extend to you. Sir  on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Suriname  our warm congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-first session. Your diplomatic skill and experience will undoubtedly contribute to a successful session.I am pleased also to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a much deserved tribute to His Excellency Mr. Jaime de Pinies of Spain  who so ably presided over the General Assembly at its fortieth session.I take this opportunity also to express the appreciation of my Government to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cue liar  for his untiring efforts in the interest of world peace  security aid international co-operation.Approximately a year ago  we  the Member States of the United Nations  commemorated the fortieth anniversary of this world Organization. The anniversary provided us with an opportunity to review the Organization's performance over the past four decades and to rededicate ourselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter. We for our part re-committed ourselves on that occasion to endorsing any constructive proposal aimed at restructuring and streamlining the United Nations to bring the Organization more into line with current world realities in order to improve its effectiveness in the interest of peace and security.My main reason for addressing the Assembly again this year is that since the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations last year  important developments have taken place in my country. From the start of our revolution  in February 1980  the representatives of my country  myself included  have tried painstakingly to keep the Assembly abreast of developments in Sur inane.We consider it appropriate before discussing those national developments to focus our attention on some international issues  both global and regional  since many of those issues have a direct bearing on our national political  economic  social and military situation. The representatives of Suriname have spoken on those issues on several occasions in this Assembly. Allow me to summarize our viewpoint on those problems as briefly as possible.The unabated arms race continues to poison and pervade the whole international community. It prolongs and even widens the gap between the rich and the poorer nations  as it leads the former to spend much more on arms than on development aid. Furthermore  the arms race wreaks havoc on the life of developing countries  since it induces them from time to time to engage in hostilities against their brother States. This ever growing madness must therefore be brought to an end.We firmly believe that the promotion of international peace and security requires continuing action by States aimed at the prevention of war  the removal of various threats to peace including the nuclear threat  respect for the principle of non-use of force  disarmament  development  the elimination of racial discrimination and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.Consequently  the Government of Suriname has on many occasions expressed its grave concern at the continuing escalation of the arms race  in particular the race in nuclear weapon and other weapons of mass destruction. We sincerely hope that the forthcoming summit conference between President Reagan andGeneral Secretary Gorbachev will generate progress in the disarmament negotiations.In our opinion  the early convening of an international conference on disarmament and development is of great importance. In this connection  I might point out that we in Suriname commemorated the United Nations International Year of Peace in a fitting manner. Amongst the activities undertaken by our Government I should like to mention only the holding of a competition for our students on the meaning of the International Year of Peace.Another disquieting issue of the 1980s is the systematic weakening of multilateral oo-operation. Some of the countries which in the past initiated and provided substantial support for multilateral efforts for creating an open  democratic and equitable world order now seem to be having second thoughts and even question the validity of the United Nations system. A retreat from our multilateral system at a time when actual developments  both in relation to world peace and to the world economy  seem to demand its strengthening is regrettable.My Government expresses its deep concern at the stresses and strains which face multilateral co-operation and the danger of drifting away from order  stability  predictability and rules  and towards arbitrariness  uncertainty and the exercise of raw power. This poses a great threat to the weaker members of the international community. It is our conviction that nothing could be more valuable for wot Id peace than a firm re-commitment of Member States to the obligations under the Charter  and to its principles and purposes.For these reasons my Government welcomes the report of the united Nations High-Level Ex per ts Group of 18 which will be dealt with during this session.We still believe that coexistence between States should be based on the principles of non-intervention and no-interference in the affairs of other States. A violation of those principles  be it active or passive  inexorably leads to the disturbance of friendly relations between nations. The use of economic coercive measures against a State  if not ratified by the world Organization or a regional legal system  is considered illegal interference in the internal affairs of that State.For those reasons  we have voiced our protest on many occasions against the unilateral suspension by the Kingdom of the Netherlands of the international Treaty on Development Co-operation concluded between our countries. We hope that the Government of the Netherlands will change its position on this matter in the near future  as this constitutes a serious obstacle for guiding our bilateral relations bade to normalcy.Before turning to some specific country issues  I feel the necessity to mention briefly a worldwide scourge. The problem of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and drug addiction is assuming world proportions and we share the growing concern of nations over this question. The serious and damaging impact on our societies deserves the special attention of the international community. Suriname is a party to various conventions dealing with the problems of drug trafficking. A special Narcotic Drugs Council was recently instituted in order to deal with this natter. Our authorities co-operate with their colleagues from other countries who are charged with combating illicit drug activities.During the Eighth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Harare we restated our position on the issues of Namibia and apartheid. The Government of Suriname has consistently stated its position on the question of Namibia by codetermine the dilatory tactics of the Government of South Africa on that issue.Once again my Government wishes to pledge its solidarity with those countries and organizations  in particular the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and the African National Congress (ANC)  which are continuing their valiant struggle to achieve freedom for the Namibian and South African peoples.The reign of terror waged by the Pretoria regime has led to turmoil and more bloodshed in southern Africa. We  the Members of the United Nations  cannot sit idly by while this tragedy is deepening day by day. As a Member of this Organization  we are obliged to do whatever is possible to put an end to that terror and to force the Pretoria regime to change its cruel attitude towards the peoples of South Africa and Namibia.We also express the hope that in the Korean question reason will prevail over distrust and conflicting ideologies and that the Korean Peninsula may be reunified through negotiations between the parties concerned.Our positions on the Middle East problem and the war between Iraq and Iran are well known. We call upon all the parties concerned to spare no efforts aimed at finding a rapid and peaceful solution to those questions  because they gravely endanger world peace and security.It would be a shortcoming not to mention in this context the debt issue specifically  it being one of the most acute problems of our time. We disagree with those who would like to limit the discussion of that problem to the international financial institutions in Washington. We believe that the United Nations is still the most viable forum to deal with this matter and that our world Organization can play a role of vital importance in this field. For that reason my delegation fully endorses the decision of the developing countries  through the Group of 77  to include an item on this issue in the Assembly's agenda.On several occasions we have expressed the hope that the Contadora process would bring an end to the suffering of the peoples of Central America. While  some of us now seem to question the possibility of reaching a regional agreement through the Contadora process  we in Suriname still believe that Contadora presents the best opportunity to achieve a comprehensive peaceful solution. We therefore urge the international community not to despair and lose hope  but to continue to endorse and support that praiseworthy initiative.I would be remiss if I did not briefly focus the attention of the members of the General Assembly on the question of the demilitarization of the Caribbean region.The Caribbean region  as representatives know  is mainly composed of small States which are highly vulnerable to economic and military threats. Bearing in mind that those States are an integral part of our. international political system  there can be no doubt that they are entitled to protection by the world community against those economic and military threats.Recent studies have made us aware of the growing danger that those States may be victimized by well-financed terrorist groups belonging to a growing sinister international underworld. Though this may sound like a bad novel  there are strong indications - and  indeed  sufficient proof - of the existence of such terrorist groups bait on overpowering such small and vulnerable States in order to find a safe haven for large amounts of money acquired by illegal means in other countries.I should now like to explain the principal reason for my returning to address the Assembly. As I said at the outset  developments of major political importance have taken place in my country. We thought it appropriate to inform the members of our world Organization about those developments  since we are well aware of tht efforts made by others to distort world opinion with regard to our country. Those efforts are aimed mainly at establishing the image that Suriname is governed by a military dictatorship wielding its power indiscriminately  without regard for the rule of law and without respect for the fundamental rights o£ man. Some of our adversaries  moreover  have tried to link us to certain Power centers  notwithstanding our sincere adherence to the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement.The continuous flow of false and mendacious information has undoubtedly had some negative effect  particularly since we are a small country which lades adequate means and manpower to counter that malicious publicity. But we ate fortunate in being able to note that Suriname and its Government have many friends and that the overwhelming majority of observers of our national scene have maintained excellent relations with us. We are grateful to those that continue toappreciate us as we really are. We are also most grateful to our many friends who recognize that we are a country in which the military and civilians are working together to establish a real democracy based on the freedom of our citizens and the respect for the rule of law  in particular regarding the fundamental freedoms of man.We are well aware that our adversaries continue to question our good intentions and seem to be blind to the fact that we are not a military dictatorship  but are governed by law and respect for the fundamental rights of man. However  the military in the Republic of Suriname has succeeded in establishing a sincere partnership. These are the simple facts  and we in Suriname submit them to the judgment of the international community.As I said earlier  our representatives have in the past regularly informed the Assembly on developments in Suriname. One of the main things that has taken place since I last addressed this body is undoubtedly the conclusion of an agreement with the major political parties. The agreement is based on the four renovations pledged to the people of the Republic of Suriname what we started our revolution in February 1980. At that time  we committed ourselves to renewing the socio-economic  social  political and administrative  and educational order of our society. That agreement  signed by me in my capacity as Leader of the Revolutionary Movement and Chief of the Armed Forces on the one hand and the leaders of those political parties on the other  provides also foe the preparation of a draft constitution.That draft constitution will outline the authority of the main organs of State as well as the fundamental human rights of our citizens. The draft constitution must be completed by our National Assembly before 1. April next year and subsequently submitted to our citizens through a referendumI should like to point out that the political parties are now participating in both the supreme Policy Council and the Council of Ministers. There can therefore be no doubt that the representatives of those political parties  who  together with the representatives of the labor movement  the business community and the revolutionary movement  constitute the two Councils  are fully involved in the process aimed at establishing a real democracy in Suriname.I should also like to emphasize that a main task of the new Council of Ministers is to see to it that the pledges we made to our people to establish a real democracy will be duly and faithfully implemented. We in Suriname believe that this process will proceed according to plan. However  as a pragmatic person  I should like to inform the Assembly that our adversaries will spare no effort to disturb and undermine that process.In recent years those adversaries have  for example  consistently tried to send mercenaries to our country with the intention of causing chaos  disruption and death. As recently as July of this year a heavily armed group of mercenaries  which had most probably been organized by persons residing in the Netherlands  was arrested by the police authorities in the United States of America. These mercenaries  for the most part  common criminals  are now on trial by that country's judicial authorities. Terrorist groups  generally established in the Netherlands  are now supporting a group of bandits engaged in terrorist activities in the eastern part of our country.When I speak of terrorism I mean those acts condemned by clear and specific resolutions adopted by the Assembly. The Government of the Republic of Suriname has requested the Government of the Netherlands to take a more active stand against those terrorist groups  particularly since those terrorists are largely recruited and financed in the territory of that country. I can assure the Assembly that our Government will overcome these troublesome events  and in this context I should like to express our sincere gratitude to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which  at its recent summit conference in Harare  vigorously condemned those terrorist activities.I should like to quote from the final document of that conference:""The Heads of State or Government reiterated their support for and solidarity with the people and the Government of the Republic of Suriname in their efforts aimed at preserving their independence and sovereignty. They welcomed the latest developments in Suriname with regard to the process of democratization through national dialog which resulted in the formation of an interim Government based on the widest representation ever brought together in the country's history.""The Heads of State or Government observed that foreign interventionist circles aided by contracted foreign mercenaries and local criminal elements were putting dangerous obstacles in Suriname's way through counterrevolutionary activities and that mercenary activities had taken place in the eastern border area  resulting in the loss of life of Surinamese civilians and soldiers. They condemned these acts and appealed to the Governments concerned to take all steps to avoid their territory being used for the activities of mercenary groups which hindered development  stability and peace in the country and which promoted unrest in the region.""The Heads of State or Government also expressed their deep concern at measures taken and continuing attempts by certain Governments to exert pressures which had an adverse effect on the political  economic and social development of Suriname.""They urged them to stop these measures and expressed the hope that the Governments concerned would engage in a frank  fair and meaningful dialogwithout coercion or any other form of interference in order to arrive at a solution on the basis of mutual respect end in the interest and well-being of the people of Suriname.""The policy of the integration of Suriname into our own Latin American and Caribbean region is one of the leading principles of our Government. We are therefore intensifying our relationship with the fraternal nations in the region  particularly with neighboring countries  as we are determined to fortify our links with the Latin American economic system as well as with the regional Caribbean system  CARICOM.The guiding principle of our revolution in 1980 was  and continues to be  the establishment of one nation from the various ethnic groups in Suriname - a truly independent nation that would be able to chart its course and determine its own destiny. In trying to realize that objective of a new and unified nation  we have suffered many set-backs  but we have weathered the stores that have faced us.During those difficult times  we had to deal with adversaries  but we also met many friends on the path. I should like to thank those friends who supported our Government and people and who continue to show them friendship.In conclusion  I should like to assure the Assembly that on our way to a real and true democracy and on the path leading to a new and viable nationc we will continue to abide by the principles on which our Organization is based.The PRESIDENT-. On behalf of the General Assembly  I wish to thank the Head of Government of the Republic of Suriname for the important statement that he has just made."
"127",6532,"SWE",41,1986,"In Sweden last week we honored the memory of Dag Hammarskjold  who  25 years ago  gave his life in the service of the United nations. Those manifestations were a tribute to an extraordinary life-work as well as an expression of the Swedish people's support for the United Nations. Olof Palae strongly emphasized this support at the fortieth anniversary session of the General Assembly last autumn. He said:°We are all aware of the problems of the Organization and can look back at both failures and successes. But the experience of 40 years has not weakened our dedication to the purposes and principles la id down in the Charter. And  More important  we look at our world today and remain convinced that the United Nations is only at the beginning of its history."" (A/40/PV. 43  p. 64) Olof Palme was right. The United Nations is an indispensable forum for co-operation between States in an increasingly interdependent world. We  the Members of the United Nations  have pledged ourselves to observe a certain code of conduct. We have at our disposal well-tried negotiating machinery and an invaluable meeting place. Only if we make the right use of these assets and live up to our commitments under the United Nations Charter can we hope to create a more peaceful and just world.We shall shortly commence consideration of how the United Nations is to overcome the current crisis  which threatens its very existence. The solutions cannot be primarily technical; ultimately  they must be based cm stronger political support for the world Organization and its purposes. Nothing would strengthen the credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations more than concrete progress in the many burning and unresolved questions on the agenda.Every day we receive new reports on the ever increasing brutal violence in South Africa. Since the imposition of the state of emergency on 16 June thousands of people have been imprisoned  many of them children and young people. Hundreds have been killed. South Africa continues its military attacks against the neighboring States and its support to armed groups in some of these countries. South Africa also disrupts the supply of goods to the front-line States and is threatening to impose other coercive economic measures. Namibia is still occupied and its people denied their independence.For decades we have appealed to the South African Government to make fundamental changes in its policy; always in vain. South Africa claims to be a democratic society  but a democratic society cannot be built on a system of racial discrimination. South Africa claims to be a civilized society  but in a civilized society people's homes are not razed to the ground. South Africa claims to be a society with Christian values  but in such a society children are not shot in the back by the police and security forces.The Swedish Government considers that the situation in southern Africa constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. Time is now rapidly running out for the peaceful abolition of the apartheid system. It is high time that the United Nations Security Council took the necessary action. The Security Council must make the South African Government realize that change is now necessary. Apartheid must be abolished and replaced by a democratic society with universal suffrage.What is required is effective sanctions.- with	content; scope and supportas to lead to positive and rapid change in South Africa. Such a decision by the Security Council will give a clear signal that the international community is now prepared to proceed to concrete action. The permanent members of the Security Council now have a historic opportunity finally to take a decisive step forward.Sanctions against South Africa will  regrettably  negatively affect its neighboring States. They are already in a distressing economic situation  but they are prepared to accept further sacrifices in order to get rid of the abhorrent apartheid system once and for all. All who have con denned apartheid in words have a moral obligation to assist those countries in their precarious situation. The United Nations has an important role to play in that regard.A decision on sanctions must  therefore  be followed up by a plan csf assistance to the front-line States. The Nordic countries are prepared to work for sued) a plan  in close co-operation with the countries concerned.Sweden has for many years given considerable assistance to the front-line States and the liberation movements  and decisions on additional support can be taken at short notice.In the Middle East the United Nations has a special responsibility to seek to achieve peace. A dangerous deadlock prevails today in the peace efforts. Sweden welcomes different attempts to break that deadlock. The aim should be to bring about direct peace negotiations - if possible  within the framework of an international conference. All parties to the conflict must be given the opportunity to participate. It is important that the Palestinians be represented in such negotiations by those who have their support. In Sweden's view  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) enjoys such support.Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 333 (1973) should be the basis fora negotiated settlement. Israel must leave the territories occupied in 1967. The Arab parties to the conflict must recognize Israel's right to exist within secure borders. The Palestinian people must at last achieve self-determination. They have the right  if they wish  to form a State of their own on the West Bank and in the Gaza strip.An overwhelming majority of Member States has repeatedly condemned the Soviet Union's armed intervention in Afghanistan  which constitutes a serious violation of international law. The Soviet troops must be withdrawn. Gross violations of human rights are committed daily. Four million people - almost a third of Afghanistan's population - have been forced to leave their homes and take refuge in neighboring countries. The Swedish Government supports the Secretary-General's efforts to seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict  which must be based on the right of the Afghan people to self-determination.The war between Iran and Iraq is now in its seventh year. It has led to immense losses cf human life on both sides. The Swedish Government views with concern the renewed use of chemical weapons and the increased number of attacks on international shipping in the area and on civilian population centers. Every effort must be made to bring an end to the suffering and to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict.The Kampuchea conflict is still unresolved. The state of war and Vietnam's occupation are causing much human suffering and creating new needs for humanitarian assistance  both inside Kampuchea and outside its borders. The people cf Kampuchea must be given the opportunity to determine their own future. That requires that the Vietnamese troops be withdrawn and that the parties to the conflict reach a negotiated settlement which will lead to peace in the area.The conflicts in Central America have their roots in economic  social and political injustices over many years. Military assistance to and within the region must cease  regardless of its origin. The efforts of the Contadora Group to reach a negotiated settlement merit every support. A resolution of the conflicts must be based cm respect for the principles of international law  such as sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United States assistance to the armed groups waging war against the lawful Government in Nicaragua has been declared a violation of international law by  among others  the International Court of Justice  and it is obstructing the efforts to bring about peace.As regards regional conflicts  it is important that the Security Council make use of the powers vested in it in the Charter. There is considerable room for expanding the role of the United Nations. The increased involvement of the Secretary-General in the efforts to resolve several difficult conflicts is indeed a promising development. The Security Council should intensify its co-operation with the Secretary-General in those efforts.More than 50 000 Swedes have to date served in the United Nations peace-keeping operations. Those missions are an important part of the work of the United Nations. The latest report of the Secretary-General and the recent Security Council debate have demonstrated that one of those operations - the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) - finds itself in a particularly precarious and critical situation. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General  and welcome the fact that those difficult issues are now the subject of thorough consideration  not least in view of our recent decision to increase Swedish participation in the Force.Sweden attaches great importance to the observances of certain fundamental principles as regards the peace-keeping operations. There must exist realistic possibilities of carrying out the tasks in accordance with the mandate. The operations should be carried out in co-operation with the parties most directly concerned  they must be of a temporary nature and contribute to resolving the conflicts.Furthermore  I stress especially the need for the support of the Security Council and a reasonable sharing of the expenses.The Swedish Cover meant  as the host country  welcomes the successful outcome of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Earope. The agreement which was reached is a step forward in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe process  which is so important for Europe. It aims at increasing confidence and thereby reducing the risks of war in Europe. The agreement is also an expression of an improved international climate. It means that the 35 Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe countries can initiate their work in Vienna in a positive atmosphere and proceed in their efforts to increase security and improve co-operation in Europe. I am convinced that it will also be an inspiration for increased efforts to reach agreement in other important negotiations. This is the occasion to reverse developments and achieve concrete agreements on arms limitation and disarmament. The opportunity must not be lost.Almost a year ago President Reagan and General-Secretary Gorbachev stated that a nuclear war could not be won and must never be fought.The arms negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union have not yet led to any visible results. On the contrary  the build-up of their strategic nuclear arsenals continues. Existing treaties are in danger.The Government of Sweden nevertheless hopes that the realization by those two leaders of the impossibility of nuclear war will soon lead to radical reductions in the nuclear arsenals of both States and to the prevention of an arms race in outer space. At a future summit meeting the two leaders must show that they are serious in their declarations.Nuclear disarmament is not the concern of the nuclear Powers alone. A nuclear war would affect everyone. The security of the non-nuclear States too is at stake. Therefore they have a right to make their voices heard on these issues  which are vital to them. Disarmament activities within the United Nations are thus of the utmost importance.The right of participation of non-nuclear-weapon States is one of the leading ideas behind the five-continent peace initiative. In the Mexico Declaration of last month  the six Reads of State or Government who stand behind this initiative addressed an appeal to the leaders of the two nuclear Powers to agree on a mutual moratorium on nuclear explosions. The Declaration contains a concrete offer of assistance in providing adequate verification arrangements. Political  not technical  problems are obstructing progress. The Swedish Government urges the United States and the Soviet Union to start negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty as soon as possible.The arms race is not only a threat to the survival of human civilization. Both nuclear and conventional armaments are also an immense waste of scarce human and material resources. Those resources should instead be used for economic and social development in a world in which hundreds of millions live in starvation and malnutrition. Halting the arms race is also a question of solidarity with the peoples of the third world.Twenty years ago the General Assembly adopted the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The ideals and the concept of human rights that form the basis of the two human rights Covenants have made it possible to uphold and defend human rights and to condemn their violation. We must not fail those ideals.International terrorism has claimed the lives of many innocent people. All States must shoulder their res pons ib ility in the fight against terrorism. International co-operation in this struggle should be intensified  not least within the United Nations and its various organs. Within the framework of international law and by the use of peaceful means  the struggle against terrorism must be vigorously pursued.Also  efforts to combat the serious drug problem must be strengthened. Sweden welcomes and will actively participate in next year's United Nations conference on that important question.It is disturbing that no decisive progress has been made in recent years within the framework of the North-South dialog. Parallel with the developing countries' own efforts  the developing and industrial countries must together tackle serious economic problems.Next year the seventh session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will provide an opportunity to achieve concrete progress on substantive issues of importance in North-South relations. Sweden considers it essential that the new trade negotiations within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) should give the developing countries improved access to the markets of the industrial countries. That would also contribute to a solution of debt problems.The special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa was successful. We welcome the demonstration by the African countries that they are prepared to undertake necessary changes in their development policies. The Program of action adopted at the special session new remains to be implemented. All donor countries must  in different ways  assist the crisis-stricken countries. Sweden at present allocates more than 60 per cent of its bilateral development assistance  or $420 million  to sub-Saharan Africa. Sweden is also prepared to continue to participate in internationally co-ordinated action to relieve the debt burden of the African countries  and has set aside funds for that purpose.Development assistance through various United Nations agencies is of great importance for many people in their daily lives. This applies  for example  to education  to health care and to food. The activities of the United Nations Children's Fund  which is celebrating its fortieth anniversary  demonstrate that multilateral co-operation can both save lives and contribute to long-term development.Sweden will continue to give substantial contributions to the multilateral development assistance organizations  such as the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)  the United Nations Children's Fund (UN ICE F)   the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). However  if results ""are to be achieved it is necessary that all industrial countries  not least the largest ones  support those organizations in line with their economic capabilities. We must not weaken the agencies fee co-operation  agencies we have built up over the years. On the contrary  they must be strengthened.Environmental degradation is a threat to the future survival of humanity. Short-term gains have been obtained by countries at the expense of their natural resources and those of other countries  and through the degradation of mankind's common heritage of air  water and soil. To remedy environmental problems  active international co-operation is required  based on real solidarity among the nations of the world.In this connection the question of nuclear safety is of great concern to the international community. We note with satisfaction the speedy conclusion  after the Chernobyl catastrophe  of negotiations on two draft conventions within the International Atomic Energy Agency (LaEA).Next year the report of the Wbrld Commission on Environment and Development will be submitted to the General Assembly. It will give Member States the opportunity to re-examine the direction of long-term international environmental co-operation.Last year we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  world leaders expressed their support for the world Organization and its activities. There is a great discrepancy between those expressions of solidarity with the United Nations and the fact that the Organization now finds itself in an acute financial crisis. How is it that some Member States express their support for the activities of the United Nations while  at the same time  in violation of existing obligations  refuse to pay for them fully and loyally? How is it that so many Member States are in arrears with their assessed contributions?The amounts in question are modest. They cannot reasonably be a great financial burden to any country. The reason for this is rather short-term political considerations and a lack of solidarity with the United Nations.We all have a self-interest in safeguarding the United Nations and upholding respect for its Charter. This must apply also to the principle  embodied in Article 17 of the Charter  of collective responsibility for the expenses of the Organization  it should be taken for granted that all Member states fully live up to this clear-cut obligation.We must now find solutions that ensure a sound financial basis for the United Nations. At the same time  it must be possible for the United Nations to adapt to changed circumstances and conditions through reforms. The Member States must be able to feel fully confident that the United Nations is using its resources in an effective way.No one denies that there is room for reforms within the United Nations and in its activities. The high-level Group to review the administrative and financial functioning of the Organization has submitted a set of recommendations for changes and improvements. These recommendations constitute a good basis for work on reforms.As chief administrative officer  the Secretary-General bears the main responsibility for the efficient use of the United Nations resources. The critical situation demands that rationalization and savings be implemented with determination. At the same time  efficient Secretariat management and planning require a stable financial basis.The present scale of assessments makes the United Nations too vulnerable and dependent on individual large contributers. When a major contributor  drastically and in violation of existing obligations  cuts its contributions - in the way that is now about to take place - the basis for the work of the entire Organization is undermined. If assessments were distributed more evenly among all Members  we would be able to reduce this vulnerability in the future. We would also emphasize more clearly that the United Nations is an organization for all States.Developments have confirmed our conviction that such a reform should eventually be implemented and included in a comprehensive solution of the problems facing the United Nations.This autumn's session will put us to the test. If our efforts are crowned with success  we shall be able to give a reassuring answer to some of the questions that are troubling people all over the world and filling them with dread of thefuture.In Sweden we are delighted to see that interest in and concern for international affairs is growing strongly  not least among the young. Children and young people pose very straight and therefore the most urgent questions. I shall quote two of many questions that a group of 10-year-olds in a school in the north of Sweden asked me last week to forward to the United Nations and its Members. These children were working on practical peace and development projects.The first question was-. ""Why do so many children die of starvation in developing countries when at the same time so much money is wasted on weapons?"". Certainly  their question and alarm are justified. Every minute  around the clock  year in and year out  30 children die for lack of food and vaccines. And every minute  around the clock  year in and year out  between one and two million dollars are spent for military purposes. Forty thousand infants in the developingcountries die every day unnecessarily.The second question put by the children was: ""What is the United Nationsdoing to help the children and young people who are persecuted  imprisoned and killed in South Africa?"". That is a question that worries young Swedes today and rouses them to indignation. I assume that the United Nations will already be able to give a concrete and positive answer to it this autumn.To quote Olof Palme yet again: ""Apartheid shall be relegated to the placewhere it belongs - the dustbin of history""."
"128",6570,"SWZ",41,1986,"Mr. President  first and foremost allow me to convey fraternal greetings from His Majesty King Mswati III to you and to all the Members of the United Nations. Further allow me to convey my delegation's warmest congratulations to you on your well-deserved election to the presidency of this forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. we are indeed delighted with your election to the helm of this august Assembly  for we feel deeply convinced that  with your wide experience and prudent leadership  this Assembly will be eminently equipped to tackle effectively the many pressing problems facing mankind in the present decade.Swaziland's delegation brings special thanks for the remarkable role played by the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Perez de Cuellar  in having brought to the attention of the Security Council matters which in his opinion threaten international peace and security.Today we live in an unstable world  a world threatened by all kinds of conflicts  be they inter-State or global. It is therefore incumbent on us as Member States of the United Nations to uphold our Charter aid interpret its provisions with the utmost care.Peace and security seem to be elusive nowadays. Many nations tend to be indifferent to resolutions of the General Assembly aid the Security Council. Should such a trend persist  Armageddon will soon befall the world  and peaceful economic development and good-neighborliness will be things of the past.The world is in dire need of complete disarmament. The accumulation of weapons of mass destruction by nations large and small threatens humanity's very existence. While many people worry more about a nuclear holocaust of some sort  let us remember that many of the wars fought in the past resulted  and those being fought today are resulting  in the loss of millions of lives through the use of conventional weapons.We have over the years witnessed gross violations of the Charter. Such violations run counter to civilized conduct and are a direct cause of tensions around the world. My delegation hopes that those nations that have succumbed to the temptation to disregard the Charter will desist  for the sake of peace and security.My delegation is concerned  further  about the prevailing State terrorism and related actions by Member States aimed at undermining the socio-political system in sovereign States. Such acts have been  and still are  a tremendous threat to international peace and security. Therefore  my delegation appeals to all Member States to refrain from  and to combat  international terrorism and similar actions aimed at destabilizing and overthrowing other Governments.Respect for human rights is of crucial importance to the world. It is sad that we still hear of torture  disappearances and wan ton killing in some parts of the world. The international community has a duty to encourage respect for human rights. Racism  racial discrimination  apartheid  exploitation of child labor and the like are all violations of human rights and must be condemned and discouraged.The elements of instability in the world economy can be resolved only by the maintenance of a rapid tempo of recovery by the developing countries  based on the flexibility of the developed countries.The world-wide recession has had a serious impact on Swaziland's economy. Our economic and financial performance has deteriorated and inflation rates have aver aged around 15 per cent  while interest rates have declined significantly  unemployment is on the increase  as the production and manufacturing sector continues to stagnate. The 50 per cent drop in the value of our currency has doubled our debt-servicing burden.I wish to reaffirm ray Government's policy  which is dictated by pragmatism rather than political and ideological realism. The Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland  however  remains committed to the principles enshrined in the Charter  particularly those principles concerning the self-determination and independence of peoples under colonial rule or any other form of oppression. The Kingdom of Swaziland reiterates its commitment to the settlement of disputes by peaceful negotiation and the non-use of force. It is my Government's objective to uplift the economic and social welfare of mankind in unity  freedom and love for one another. We are convinced that if such an atmosphere prevails future generations will enjoy the fruits of peace  unity and stability.Swaziland  as a peace-loving country  is greatly perturbed by the current situation in world politics. The situation in the Middle East continues to plague the deliberations of the international community.M/ delegation is very much aware of the situation in Lebanon. Therefore  we commend the Lebanese people for their untiring efforts to pursue their socio-economic and political development. My delegation remains firmly convinced that peace in Lebanon can be effected only by the complete withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory. Only then will the Lebanese be in control of their destiny.The ongoing war in the Persian Gulf is also a matter of great concern to the international community. My delegation humbly urges all the parties concerned to exercise moral restraint and resolve their differences by peaceful means.On the question of world peace and security  it is important to refer to the sensitive political situation that continues to divide North and South Korea. The reunification of Korea is a matter to be decided by the Koreans themselves in direct inter-Korean negotiations. It remains for the United Nations to continue to encourage the resumption of those talks without pre-conditions or external interference.In South-East Asia the protracted occupation of Kampuchea by foreign forces continues to deprive the people of Kampuchea of their right to self-determination. The present activities of the invasion force have compelled many thousands of people to flee their homeland into neighboring Thailand. That in itself has aggravated the refugee problem and is a big burden on Thailand's economy. The Kampuchea problem poses a grave threat to regional peace and security.With regard to the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan  my delegation fully supports the decision of the General Assembly calling for their withdrawal. We hope that such a withdrawal will constitute the essential first step towards tine normalization of the situation. My delegation wishes to thank and congratulate the Secretary-General and all concerned for their relentless efforts in seeking a peaceful solution to the Namibian question. My delegation believes that the Namibian question should be settled on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).On the question of apartheid  my Government and the people of Swaziland abhor apartheid and believe that it must be dismantled. Swaziland is unswervingly committed to the principles of non-racial democracy  non-alignment and complete respect for human dignity  justice and peaceful coexistence with all.My delegation is gravely concerned at the large number of refugees in Africa  and is also cognizant of the economic and social burden imposed on African countries of asylum  whose weak economies suffer the negative effects of the situation. Swaziland falls in that category. My delegation welcomed the holding in 1984 of the Second International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  the objective of which was to find lasting solutions to this problems of refugees. My delegation urges the international community  the United Nations and its specialized agencies to provide the necessary co-operation in implementing projects approved by the Conference. Swaziland urges all countries and international organizations to assist in the relief and rehabilitation of refugees now in large numbers in this small Kingdom. My delegation also relies on the support measures adopted by the Assembly of Beads of State or Government of the Organization of African unity with a view to granting financial and material assistance to the southern African States. Therefore my delegation will appreciate prompt action by all States  international organizations  the United Nations and its agencies.Finally  I wish to reaffirm Swaziland's trust and faith in the United Nations. The united Nations remains the only appropriate international forum for finding solutions to the major world problems of today. Therefore it is incumbent upon all of us as States Member s to renew our commitment to the purposes and principles of the united Nations."
"129",6645,"SYR",41,1986,"On behalf of the delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic and on my own behalf  I am pleased at the outset of this statement to extend to Ambassador Choudhury our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. His election to this distinguished post is a source of deep satisfaction to us  since he represents a friendly country with which Syria has ancient  historical ties. Moreover  both our countries are members of the Conference of the Islamic Organization and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We are confident that his diplomatic experience and political skills will contribute to the success of our work and place the General Assembly on the road to the attainment of its goals.We also take this opportunity to express our appreciation to Mr. Jaime de Pinies  whose efficiency and wisdom contributed greatly to the success of the fortieth session of the General Assembly.I am also duty bound to express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the strenuous efforts he has been making to enhance the role of the United Nations and to reaffirm adherence to its Charter and principles in the conduct of international relations - and all this for the benefit of mankind and the cause of freedom and world peace. We are very happy that he has resumed his duties following his recovery  and we wish him the best of health.This time last year we in this Hall witnessed an important event - not merely the commemoration of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  but also the exceptional opportunity afforded to leaders and representatives of the Governments of the entire world to review the achievements of our international Organization and to assess its failures since its inception.It also afforded an opportunity to analyze and discuss the aspirations and concerns of the countries of the world with regard to the major issues and crises which the Organization has so far been unable to solve.Summarizing our general impressions of that important event  we could conclude that no representative of any country of the world  large or small  strong or weak  was able to paint a reassuring or optimistic picture of mankind's future in the shadow of an escalating nuclear-arms race on earth. And what would the situation be if such a race were to spread beyond the earth and spill over into outer space? Furthermore  none of the representatives of the countries of the world  rich or poor  advanced or developing  was able to speak with confidence about the future of their countries' national economies  as a result of the continuing crises in  and unpredictable fluctuations of  the world economy.It was abundantly clear that the countries of the world had two major motives in commemorating the fortieth anniversary: The first was the fact that 40 years had passed since the end of the Second World War without a third world war. The second was that the United Nations has continued to exist  as the only international organization to which the countries of the world may resort in order to lodge their complaints and solve their problems.Although we in no way belittle the great significance of those two international achievements  it still should not be forgotten that the number of victims of wars and acts of aggression backed by world imperialism during the past 40 years - beginning with the Korean war and continuing through Viet Nam  the Middle East  Africa and Latin America - has not been fewer than the number of those who fell in the Second World War. Moreover  we should not disregard the fact that the United Nations has been unable to reach appropriate and just solutions to many serious crises in the world - not to speak of the financial and political pressures to which this international Organization has been subjected of late  with the aim of diminishing its role and reducing its effectiveness.The countries of the third world which in the past paid a heavy price in blood and sweat in their long and arduous confrontations with the forces of old colonialism are today still paying a heavy price  one way or another  in their current confrontations with world imperialism and neo-colonialism. That is a well-established fact and I need not dwell on it. Our international Organization must pay attention to this confrontation with the forces of world imperialism and neo-colonialism and assign to it a higher priority  like that given to the question of decolonization.The cause of peace in the world is indivisible. Peace has always been and continues to be the dream of mankind. World peace  however  can be achieved only by liquidating the regional strongholds of imperialism  racism and neo-colonialism  because those strongholds  those vestiges of imperialism are the main source of finance which feeds the military machine of those Powers  and propels them towards strategic superiority in the international arena  as a sure means of safeguarding their interests in those areas of the world.Because of its economic and strategic importance  our Arab region is still the ideal strategic position  the one most coveted by the forces of imperialism. Those forces have been aided and abetted by the settler-colonialist invasion with which they have allied themselves in our region. That invasion was planned in the capitals of the colonial Powers and since 1948 has been and still is carried out by world Zionism in stages  with the continuing and escalating support of the colonial Powers and world imperialism  especially the United States of America. Relations between Israel and the United States of America have in recent years reached the level of strategic alliance  not only in the regional bat also in the international context. That is evident from Israel's participation in the strategic Defense Initiative - also known as ""Star wars"".Despite our earnest desire over the years that the Arab-Israeli conflict should not spread beyond the regional context  the United States of America has systematically insisted on being a party to the conflict  owing to its blind bias in favor of Israel. Thus it has put its military arsenals and the Federal Treasury at Israel's disposal.The affirmation of this blind bias has not been linked by any means to the statements and deeds of united States officials  which have been so numerous that there is no room to ;ite them in detail here. It has also been manifested in the emergence of American groups which vie with the Zionist lobby itself in propagating racist hysteria against the Arabs  whom they accuse of being a nation of terrorists. Such groups act on the theory that God created the United States of America to protect and defend Israel. In their book  opposition to Israel is defiance of God's will  and support for Israeli animosity against the Arabs is obeying God's bidding. Is it reasonable to claim that God discriminates between the human beings created by Him and exalts one people at the expense of another? Is it reasonable that God should will the existence of a people whose task it is to attain for another people whatever the latter desires?Israel  which has made millions of Arabs homeless and driven them from their homeland  Palestine  carries out racist  terrorist practices against the Arab population languishing under Israeli occupation in the West Bank  the Gaza Strip  the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. Hence  Israel should be the last country in the world to accuse others of terrorism. Israel is the mother source and the root cause of terrorism in our region. This reality cannot be altered by distortion of facts and concepts by a mass media machine operated by Zionist-imperialists which is intent on misleading world public opinion on an unprecedented scale. Israel's objective behind these campaigns and calumnies is not to combat terrorism  which we  together with the entire world  condemn  but rather to try to justify the State terrorism practiced by itself and by the United States of America against the Arabs and delude the Governments and peoples of the world into believing that the struggle of the Arabs to liberate their occupied territories and regain their usurped rights is a reprehensible act of terrorism. We are firmly convinced that such attempts are doomed to failure sooner or later. History has taught us that national resistance to invaders and occupiers vanquishes the vociferous clamor of colonialists  occupiers and their lackeys and will forever respond to the call of liberation and independence.We  the Arabs  whether we live in our motherland or in the countries of expatriation  are not to be intimidated by the systematic racist campaigns aimed at branding us with terrorism. Such hostile campaigns  contrary to the wishes of their perpetrators  are bound to alert world pubic opinion to the hoax and raise certain logical questions  why did this terrorism take place? What are its motives? Was it possible for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  the destruction of whole towns and villages in the south  the eviction of its inhabitants  the shelling of Beirut with thousands of tons of American-made bombs for 90 consecutive days - was it possible for all this to take place without any reaction? Why should the Palestinians continue to be deprived of the right to return to their homes and properties  while Israel impudently insists that certain countries should allow Jews to emigrate to Israel? Such questions will continue to be asked until the world at large comes to realize who is the true terrorist  who is going unpunished who is the victim and who deserves all possible support and solidarity.The United Nations is called upon today more urgently than ever before to makea concerted international effort to draw a clear line between terrorism and resistance  so that it may be able to make an effective  constructive contributionto putting an end to the cycle of violence and counter-violence that has engulfed our region and other regions of the world.While we fully appreciate that Israel's motives in strongly opposing such international efforts  which would expose its pretexts and unmask its aggressive  expansionist intentions  we fail to see the logic of the United States Administration's opposition to such joint international efforts  while it gives top priority in its foreign policy to combating terrorism. We can understand such a position only in the light of the blind bias of the United States in favor of Israel  a country that would have the world believe that legitimate national resistance is terrorism and that systematic State terrorism is legitimate self-defense.This American position  in which we can see no justifiable moral or political interest of the United States  clearly indicates that the United States Administration is more concerned with defending the policies of aggression practiced by Israel than with the lives of its innocent citizens  who have been and continue to be subjected to acts of retaliation generated by this American position. Israel and the United States of America have engaged in acts of State terrorism through the hijacking of Arab civil aircraft and the bombing of a number of Arab capitals and other cities  the latest of which were the American acts of aggression and barbaric raids on the residential neighborhoods of Tripoli and Benghazi.The Syrian Arab Republic has declared more than once its readiness to contribute to any joint international effort to combat terrorism. This was clearly stated in President Hafez Assad's address in Athens on 27 May 1986 during a State visit to Greece. The Syrian Arab Republic does not stop at a mere declaration of its position. It has actually put this into practice through its backing ofLebanese and Palestinian resistance to the Israeli occupation on the one hand and its sincere condemnation of all forms of terrorism on the other. As everybody knows  the Syrian Arab Republic has given and continues to give humanitarian assistance with the aim of saving the lives -f scores of American  French and other citizens kidnapped in Lebanon. If we have not been able so far to save all the persons kidnapped  this is because of the complexities of the situation in Lebanon. The aim of our presence in Lebanon is well known. It is to help our Lebanese brothers put an end to the bloodshed and achieve national reconciliationamong th ens elves  not to replace them or rule them.The Syrian Arab Republic will remain committed to these concepts and principles regarding the evil of terrorism and the right to resist  regardless of whether the hostile campaigns of defamation continue or cease. AsPresident Hafez Assad said in Athens:""We are on the side of resistance and liberation everywhere and againstterrorism in any part of the world.""The Middle East region  which has been divided and fragmented by the schemes of colonialists and the Zionist settlers' wars against the Arabs  cannot enjoy genuine peace as long as Israel continues to occupy Arab lands and usurp Palestinian rights  and as long as the United States continues to give its unlimited support to this Israeli policy of aggression  expansion and terror. It changes nothing that the Americans and the Israelis claim that they want peace. It changes nothing that some Arab regimes fall into the Israeli-American trap or try to deceive the countries of the world by using more or less opportunistic phrases relating to peace  phrases that are used by the Americans and the Israelis whenever the world public becomes seriously conceded about the explosive situation in the Middle East and the effect it may have on world peace and security. An examination of American-Israeli claims 2nd statements shows without any doubt that Israeli and American officials have not budged one inch from their well-known positions. They want peace and security for Israel. Free the Arabs they want capitulation and acceptance of hegemony. This was laid down in the Camp David Accords and has been reaffirmed recently at the Ifrane and Alexandria meetings. Such a course of action  however  completely ignores the fact that real peace can never be achieved against peoples' will or at the expense of their rights and national interests.We  the Arabs  have a genuine interest in peace  and we are the people who are struggling to achieve peace. But peace has its roots and fundamental prerequisites. There can be no peace in the presence of aggression and occupation. Nor can there be peace while rights continue to be usurped. Peace can only be achieved through the elimination of aggression  the ending of occupation and the restoration of Arab rights  foremost among which is the right of the Palestinian Arab people to repatriation  their right to self-determination and their right to an independent State on their native soil. The road to peace is an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations  attended by the permanent members of the Security Council and all the parties concerned.Lebanon continues to suffer under Israel's continuing occupation of parts of its territories and Israel's interference in its internal affairs  the sowing of hatred among its citizens and the obstruction of efforts to achieve accord andpeace in Lebanon.Despite Lebanon's difficult circumstances which arise from infighting and the Israeli invasion  Syria will never cease to discharge its obligations dictated by the links of brotherhood between itself and Lebanon. The obstacles placed by Israel and the United States of America will not discourage Syria from extending help to the brotherly people of Lebanon. We shall keep extending that help until the Lebanese people achieve national reconciliation  liberate their territories from Israeli occupation  and regain their full role within the Arab fold and the international community. The sad events endured recently by the United Nations troops in southern Lebanon are the result of Israel's continued occupation and its refusal  from the outset  to allow the deployment of those troops along the borders  leaving them dispersed inside Lebanese territories and unable to carry out their mandate laid down in Security Council resolution 425 (1978).The complete withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all Lebanese territories and thedeployment of the United Nations forces along the borders will help to pacify thesituation in southern Lebanon and restore normal life to its inhabitants who  formany long years  have suffered under Israeli occupation  with its barbaricpractices and interference in their daily life.The persistence of the Pretoria regime in its racist policies  acts of aggression  occupation of Namibia and defiance of the will of the international community require the application of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against that regime in accordance with Chapter VII of the Uhited Nations Charter until the elimination of apartheid and the accession to immediate independence by Namibia on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).The close collaboration between the Pretoria and Tel Aviv regimes  designed to break the will of the Arabs and Africans and undermine their peoples' aspirations should be strongly condemned. Those two racist regimes should be isolated in the international arena  and an end put to their racist and expansionist policies.The question of Cyprus is a source of deep concern to the Mediterranean countries. Any solution to this problem should be based on the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions so as to preserve for the Republic of Cyprus its sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-alignment.We support the efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to reunite the Korean homeland by peaceful means and to achieve the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea  and we support its call toconvert the Korean Peninsula into a zone of peace free of military bases and nuclear weapons.we support the Government of Afghanistan in defense of its country's independence  sovereignty and non-alignment. We wish success to the steps taken to solve the difficulties existing between Afghanistan and its neighbors  to whom weare linked by close historical ties.The continuing deterioration of the situation in Central America and the Caribbean requires a settlement of the problems of that region in accordance with the wishes of their peoples without outside interference. We support the initiative of the Contadora countries in this connection and strongly condemn the external pressures against  and interference in  the internal affairs of Nicaragua by the United States of America. We denounce the contempt shown by the United States of America towards the ruling of the International Court of Justice withrespect to Nicaragua's just complaint.The arms race at the international level imperils mankind and exposes it to the gravest of dangers  foremost among which is the danger of a nuclear world war  whether by mistake or through a sense of superiority. We  therefore  consider every effort designed to reduce nuclear weapons as a step towards their final elimination  an important factor that would help to enhance international peace andsecurity.On this occasion  we applaud the constructive disarmament initiative of the soviet union  specifically the unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests. At the same time  we denounce the American Strategic Defense Initiative designed to militarize outer space  and strongly condemn Israel's involvement in that program.The issue of disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons is a most serious one. It requires an urgent solution that would save future generations from the continuing dangers that threaten mankind with self-destruction. Any delay in finding such a solution will only render it more difficult or even impossible inthe future. In the meantime  billions of dollars are being spent on weapons at the expense of the basic needs of peoples and their development  as well as at the expense of the contributions of the industrialized countries towards combating starvation  poverty and disease suffered by some developing countries.The world  as it celebrates this year the International Year of Peace  hopes that our work at this session will achieve tangible progress towards building a better world in which justice and peace prevail  and all aspects of oppression  injustice and exploitation of man by man disappear.It is essential that the international community intensify its efforts to avert the dangers which beset mankind and curb the continuing deterioration of the international situation  which will place the world on the brink of a terrifying disaster  the aftermath of which will spare no one.This world Organization  which remains the most appropriate forum for solving all outstanding international problems and achieving progress  deserves all our support so that it may be enabled to play its effective and useful role in contemporary international relations in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter."
"130",6690,"TCD",41,1986," First  Sir  I wish  like previous speakers  to extend to you the sincere congratulations of the delegation of Chad on your election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. Your well-known qualities  particularly your knowledge and experience of international affairs  are  I am convinced  a guarantee of the success of our work. I can assure you of the full support and co-operation of my delegation in the performance of your duties.I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. de Pinies  who conducted the work of the fortieth session with wisdom and effectiveness.I express our gratitude once again to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless efforts in the cause of peace and to arouse international awareness of the economic crisis in the countries of the third world in general and the tragic situation of the African States in particular.It was with the assistance of the United Nations that our country was able to organize two conferences on assistance to Chad in November 1982 and December 1985 in Geneva. We reiterate our thanks to the countries and organizations that participated in those meetings and renew our appeal to them to fulfill their commitments so that the outstanding endeavor that we have begun together may bemade effective. To the same end  Chad hopes to organize very soon a conference of donors. My delegation would be grateful if the Secretary-General would appeal to Member States and financial organizations to participate in that conference.We take this opportunity to say once again how grateful our Government is to friendly and brotherly countries and to international governmental and non-governmental organizations for the very valuable assistance they gave our country at a time of drought and serious famine.Today  strictly from the point of view of rainfall  the peasants of Chad are again hopeful. Despite the fact that vast areas still suffer from bad rainfall distribution  greenery is reappearing  but greenery does not automatically mean that there will be a harvest  for the rats that dig up the seedlings and the locusts and birds that eat the plants and ears of corn are rapacious scourges.Hope is thus still fragile  and that is why the Government of Chad has called for the assistance of the international community in the struggle against predators.Another handicap is that cotton  which is the main cash crop of the country  in no way compensates for losses in the food sector. The drop in the price of that commodity on the international market has caused an alarming reduction in the income of the peasants and increased the financial deficit of the State. For the 1985-1986 season alone  the deficit in the cotton sector was higher than our State budget. The Government is thus compelled to incur debts to avoid the bankruptcy of our peasantry. The Assembly will appreciate how the deterioration in the world market jeopardizes progress in the economy of my country.As a result of the financial weakness of national economic operators  it is the State that bears the burden of rebuilding the country  where almost everything must be reconstructed  beginning with the roads and railways  the deplorable state of which  or even total lack of which in some regions  made it difficult to transport food to the victims of drought. This situation  which is made worse by the absence of an outlet to the sea  the immensity of the country and the fact that housing is scattered  has reduced domestic trade and is a serious handicap to development.This year  many Chadians who left the country because of the lack of security or moved away following natural disasters have returned to their homes. Despite the commendable efforts of the international community  wide areas of activity have not recovered from the shock of drought and desertification. This is the case with regard to stock rearing  which provides the livelihood of one in five Chadians. The cattle have been decimated and the environment has worsened to such a point that thousands of families have neither the means to build up their herds nor the possibility of switching to some other type of activity. Chad appreciates the support of the international community and will continue to need that assistance to rehabilitate displaced persons and revive the sectors that have been stricken by disaster.The disorganization of our economy has naturally had an effect on the social infrastructure. Our overcrowded schools and clinics are dilapidated and in need of both equipment and qualified staff.There is  however  an even greater obstacle to the recovery of Chad's economy. That obstacle is the Libyan aggression  which puts a heavy burden on Chad's budget  impeding all development efforts and imperiling the very existence of our State.The Libyan army entered Chad in 1972 and since 1983 has extended its occupation over 550 000 square kilometers of our territory. That army is equipped with the most sophisticated arsenals and has built landing strips for heavy aircraft and fighter planes in Faya  Fada  Wadi Doum and Aouzou. It is from these strongholds that Libya has been launching increasingly violent attacks with the aim of considering the rest of Chad's territory. The most recent attacks  in February  March and April of this year  resulted in hundreds of deaths  and many Libyan soldiers were taken prisoner by the Chad army. Furthermore  every day the national armed forces of Chad receive their compatriots  who are fleeing the zone occupied by Libya. These escapees go through unimaginable danger  crossing the desert  generally on foot  pursued by Libyan patrols. Great indeed are the perils of this march  but the life of the Chadians in the Libyan-occupied zone is even worse. The invaders mistreat the defenseless people  destroy the marks of Chadian culture and impose their own. It is indeed a policy of colonization that Libya is practicing in the north of Chad.Fortunately  the international community has not been taken in by Libya's intentions in Chad. My Government welcomes the courageous attitude adopted by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  which  at its recent summit meeting  reassessed the problem and reactivated the ad hoc committee on the conflict between Chad and Libya. We are convinced that the United Nations will also give its full support to this initiative  especially since it has been considering the complaint of Chad since March 1983.Once again my delegation draws the General Assembly's attention to the genocide to which the whole population of the occupied zone is exposed. We call upon the international community to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Libyan troops from the whole of Chad's territory.Like all peace- and justice-loving countries  Chad is committed to a peaceful solution to the differences among States. It is on the strength of this principle that we have increased our efforts to resolve the conflict between Chad and Libya through dialog; unfortunately  Libya has chosen force. Faithful to the basic principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations - respect for the sovereignty of States  independence  territorial integrity and the right to self-defense - my country appeals to France to help it repel the Libyan aggression. We thank the peoples and Governments of friendly  fraternal countries for their material and moral support.Chad's situation has not prevented it from considering other serious problems that beset various parts of the world. As regards terrorism  which is now of concern to all continents  the Government of Chad submitted to the Security Council  in January 1985  irrefutable proof of the ongoing conspiracy of Libya to destabilize our country and sow desolation. The same criminal procedures have been used since then against the peaceful  innocent people of several countries. The most recent example was the attack on the capital of Togo by a commando sent from abroad. Through me the Government of Chad again expresses to the fraternal people of Togo and to their Government its feelings of solidarity and compassion in the face of this trial.It is alarming to note that  confronted with the danger of terrorism  the organizers and the sanctuaries of which are known( the international community has been a long time in taking preventive action. This tolerance and impunity give the terrorists and the countries that use them added confidence to strike with increasing frequency against innocent people..It is high time the United Nations condemned the countries that arm  protect and use terrorists  for remaining silent about these odious  unjustifiable practices could subject the world to the law of terror and blackmail.In the Middle East the problem of Palestine  which has been going on for several decades  is a real powder-keg  threatening peace and stability in the subregion. Chad has always supported the struggle of the Palestinian people and hopes that they may be able to regain their rights and dignity in accordance with the relevant provisions of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and by the Security Council. My delegation too voices the hope for a speedy end to the state of war  the tragic results of which have affected the peoples of the entire region and  in particular  the Lebanese people. In order to resolve this difficult problem  we believe that the parties to the conflict should implement a processdesigned  first  to restore peace  and then to open the way to dialog  and  finally  to bring about a just and lasting solution.We note with regret that the Iran-Iraq conflict between two fraternal countries is still going on despite the mediation efforts being made by friendly countries and  in particular  international bodies. The Government of Chad supports the peace initiatives of Iraq and calls upon the antagonists to co-operate with the international organizations to put an end to the state of war.The situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea is another source of concern for ray delegation. Indeed the peoples of Afghanistan and Kampuchea are courageously fighting to free themselves from the foreign occupying forces  the presence of which imperils not only the future of these two countries  but also the entire balance in Asia. We call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Afghanistan and Kampuchea of the occupation forces  the presence of which threatens peace and stability.In regard to Central America  we encourage the initiatives of the Contadora Group to find a peaceful solution to the problems in the region to restore peace and co-operation to that part of the world.In southern Africa the racist regime of Pretoria continues to deprive the black people of their most elementary rights  despite the repeated appeals of international bodies  including the Security Council. The presence of South Africa in Namibia is unjustifiable and in defiance of the international community  in defiance of the United Nations and of the Security Council. Apart from the systematic plundering of the resources of Namibia  the illegal occupation of this territory by the minority regime of Pretoria is a threat to peace and stability in this part of Africa. It is from the territory of Namibia that South Africa has been stepping up its acts of aggression against the front-line countries. My Government appeals to the international community and in particular theUnited Nations to take fresh initiatives to make South Africa put an end to its attacks on the front-line countries and to implement resolution 435 (1978) of the Security Council for the independence of Namibia.In the opinion of my delegation  economic problems have the same priority as political problems. For more than a decade the developing countries have been calling for a more just and equitable new international economic order. The chances of development in the third world depend basically on the prospects for North-South co-operation and on the efforts of the industrialized countries to revive dialog among partners.Unfortunately  the difficulties are legion: a chronic deficit in the balance of payments  a dramatic drop in commodity prices and reduction in official development assistance. Given that highly unfavorable situation  the foreign debt of those countries has attained such a level as to negate all the efforts and sacrifices that have been made. The African continent has suffered a deep economic recession  one aggravated by natural disasters. In recent years several countries have recorded negative performances  and the medium-term prospects do not look bright.That is why  four months ago  Africa was honored by having a special session of the General Assembly devoted to it to consider the critical economic situation prevailing there. That session was entrusted with a very important task - that of strengthening international co-operation to resolve the continent's long-range problems in keeping with the United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  1986-1990.We remain convinced that the impetus of solidarity will not abate  thus making it possible for a continent that has been thrust into marginality to participate as an active partner in international economic life."
"131",6736,"TGO",41,1986,"we come once again to this important rostrum  on the occasion of the forty-first session of the General Assembly  in 1986  which has been proclaimed the International Year of Peace. I wish peace to you  Mr. President  peace to all delegations  peace to all nations  peace on our earth. Catharsis is not needed to recall the dream of mankind that peace will reign among all men and all peoples. Is it not the desire of all that we can extinguish the hotbeds of tension throughout the world? What would be the meaning of the celebration of this International Year of Peace were we to continue to deny the right to development of some and seek to maintain our domination over others  to continue the frenetic arms race? Can our Organization one day fulfill its raison d'etre  that is  the maintenance of peace and security in the world? Members will understand my perplexity faced with this desolate theater that is our world and conscious as I am of being a burlesque character in a play in which the stupidity of man prevents him from realizing the world of peace to which he aspires.Last year  the fortieth anniversary of our Organization aroused great hope of a fresh start in international relations  and the celebration of the International Year of Peace should be considered as a milestone in this renewal  which calls for new thinking about the role of our Organization.The founding Members  who had witnessed tragedies that sowed death and desolation on earth  gave the maintenance of peace pride of place in the Charter of the Organization to which we all belong.By becoming signatories to the Charter did we not declare that""We  the peoples of the United Nations  determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind  and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small""?By becoming signatories to the Charter did we not declare our faith in the purposes and principles of the Organization? Did we not undertake""To maintain international peace and security ... to take effective collective measures ... for the suppression of acts of aggression ... and to bring about by peaceful means  and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law  adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace""? Does the celebration of the International Year of Peace herald the fulfillment of our hopes for the strengthening of peace and mutual trust among nations and the advent of more just and equitable co-operation so that our Organization may fulfill its destiny?Can the celebration of the International Year of Peace mean that the present hotbeds of tension will be extinguished  that effective negotiations on nuclear disarmament will be resumed  that it will be realized that peace on earth is essential if we are to achieve our common destiny?This common destiny  Mr. President  is a bond between my country and yours  with which we enjoy close ties of friendship and oo-operation. It is no mere coincidence that at the time of the celebration of the International Year of Peace you are presiding over the work of our session. You belong to a country and a Continent which are the cradle of an age-old civilization and great religions theessence of which are virtue and peace. Issued with this philosophy of peace  the corollary of which is love and tolerance - there is absolutely no doubt that you will be able to harmonize any discordant notes that nay be heard in guiding our work in harmony towards positive results. It therefore gives my delegation great pleasure to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. We assure you of the readiness of the delegation of Togo to co-operate with you in carrying out your heavy responsibilities.We have not yet forgotten the outstanding nature of last year's session  on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of our Organization. With his clear thinking  his sense of moderation and his wisdom  combined with his great diplomatic skill  Mr. Jaime de Pinie's won the admiration of all for the ability with which he presided over the work of that session. I should like to pay a personal tribute to him as well as to his country.In this year in which ws are celebrating the International Year of Peace  no one  i think  could deny the efforts made by the Secretary-General of our Organization  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to establish peace in the tense regions of our world. The timely initiatives he has always undertaken  which reflect his determination to attain the primary goal of our Organization - the maintenance of international peace and security - as well as his devotion  call for a special tribute  for encouragement and congratulation from my Government and my delegation. Our pleasure at seeing him participate in our work is particularly great since we were deeply disquieted to learn of the brief indisposition that had prevented him from fully assuming his functions. It is our sincere hope that he will regain his full strength so that he may continue the work to which he is devoted as the head of the Secretariat of this Organization.The peace that we all sincerely hope for through respect for the Charter of the United Nations would be completely meaningless were we to forget that it must help to bring about the full development of man in all aspects of his being.It seems appropriate therefore to remind ourselves once again of this basic truth by quoting the words of our Secretary-Generals""When we pursue together the ideals and purposes of the Charter  let us be careful not to forget the quality of the world we are seeking to build and the ultimate raison d'etre of all our work: the human being as an individual for whom the Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the right to a social and international order so that human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully respected.""It seems that we have lost sight of the quality of the world in which we want to live as well as our basic raison d'etre on this earth. How else can we explain that we have failed to resolve problems such as apartheid in South Africa  theillegal occupation of Namibia  Kampuchea and Afghanistan  the situation in the Middle East  the Iran-Iraq war  the situation in Korea and in Central America  the arms race and the underdevelopment of young nations  among other things  Yes  apartheid must cease in South Africa. Yes  we forget too often that the fundamental raison d'etre of all our activities is man.We too often forget that we signed the Charter of the United Nations or that we acceded to it  and in so doing  we proclaimed""faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person"".We too often forget that human rights are universal and inherent in the human person and that they cannot vary with color of skin. For its part  as General Gnassingbe Eyadema  President-Founder of the Rally of the Togolese People and President of the Republic said:""Togo cannot tolerate the situation of injustice and oppression now prevailing in this region  where a regime unworthy of man and of our era and contrary to any moral code is being maintained by means of extraordinary violence carried out against a population whose wrong is only the color of their skin."" For that reason the Government of Togo appeals to the whole of the international community to mobilize all its resources to put an end to the despicable apartheid regime. For how long will the international community resign itself to the defiance of South Africa? Everything leads one to believe that this regime will continue to flout the international community as long as it can count on the understanding of some countries that refuse to take action against it. The purpose of United Nations resolutions calling on all States to put an end to diplomatic  military  economic and other relations with the regime of South Africa in order to inflict on South Africa sufficiently meaningful penalties to oblige itto give up its inhuman policy of apartheid has never been achieved. The principal partners concerned take shelter behind their constitution and their own national opinion  which  however  has reacted in favor of the abolition of that apartheid policy. The Afrikaner poet Breyten Breytenbach quite rightly summed up the situation when he wrote:""The apartheid regime only exists because the world allows it to exist. It flourishes  it is accepted  encouraged  fed  armed  and saved if necessary  because it benefits South Africa's trading partners and investors."" It is comforting  however  to note that the international community has stepped up its political and economic pressure on the racist regime. That pressure must be increased and comprehensive mandatory sanctions must be implemented. We salute the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Senate which  at the beginning of August  almost unanimously approved the imposition of economic sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa  following the trade embargo already adopted by the House of Representatives.The commercial restrictions decided on against the apartheid regime by Canada  the Scandinavian countries  the countries of the European Economic Community and others should be encouraged  so that they may attain their goal.We praise those Governments for their determination and for the measures they have taken. The courageous position of the front-line States and of some Commonwealth States must also be commended. Those measures should be increased following the introduction by the Pretoria Government of further measures to strengthen the emergency law imposed on 12 June and aimed at giving the heads of the local police forces enormous powers  such as the power to arrest anti-apartheid militants  to impose curfews in black zones  to prohibit political activities  andto impose restrictions on freedom of the press.It is time that States that have refused to adopt meaningful sanctions against South Africa reacted in a similar manner. It is time for the States that continue to maintain direct or indirect relations with the racist regime of Pretoria to understand that it is they who support and encourage apartheid  with no respect for the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  notwithstanding the dignity of the human person in South Africa. It is time for South Africa to understand that apartheid is going through its death throes and that measures must be taken immediately to bring about its elimination through peaceful means. Otherwise - without wishing to be a prophet of doom - the new multiracial  egalitarian society called for by the blacks will be writ in blood.Such is the grim conclusion reached by Sir Shridath Ramphal  Secretary-General of the Commonwealth  when he stated at the latest Paris conference on sanctions against South Africa:""... in 10 years  things have changed. Apartheid must cease ... and it will cease - if necessary by means of a bloody struggle whose cost in human lives will be reckoned in millions of victims  whose agony will have repercussions in every corner of our multiracial world.""No individual  no people can indefinitely put up with the tyranny of another individual or another people. No people can bear passive witness to its own destruction.History is full of edifying examples  and a number of countries which now tacitly or openly protect the racist regime of Pretoria should recall the struggle of their own peoples to regain their rights.Let us wake up and courageously take proper steps to bring about the peaceful advent of a multiracial  egalitarian society  before it is too late. Let us think more deeply about our reason for being on this earth and the purpose of ourexistence  and we will understand the need to rid ourselves of the instincts to accumulate and to dominate whereby we deny the blacks in South Africa their human rights.Let us not forget the words of President Eyadema:""What we must remember is the need for the whole of humanity to guarantee humane living conditions for all individuals.19 Let us thus make an effort to guarantee to all South Africas  whether white  black colored or Indian  those humane living conditions by tolling the knell for the odious practice of apartheid. For its part  Africa is ready to face its responsibilities  not by accepting reform  modernization or any mere cosmetic change of apartheid  but its total destruction. As was proclaimed by Oliver Tambo the courageous African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) militant: ""We must make the South African regime ungovernable and apartheid impracticable.""o)Still on the subject of southern Africa  the racist regime of Pretoria continues to maintain its domination over the people of Namibia. In order to perpetuate its illegal occupation of Namibia through a so-called internal solution  the South Africa Government has increased and is increasing the obstacles it has placed in the way of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) containing the United Nations plan for that Territory's independence. Further  it has continued its acts of armed intervention against the front-line countries  with the encouragement of the supporters of the rebel groups that harass those States. As in the case of apartheid  it is essential that pressures be brought to bear on the Pretoria Government to force it to abandon this latest neocolonialist maneuver of an interim government and to recognize that the only valid course is independence granted under .'evolution 435 (1978)  free of any linkage with the withdrawal of the Cuban troops from Angola. In this International Year of Peace we must hope for the advent of an independent Namibia in which the Namibians can live in peace.It is fitting to recall in this connection operative paragraphs 1 and 6 of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  which state:""1. The subjection of peoples to alien subjugation  domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights  is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and is an impediment to the promotion of world peace and co-operation.""6. Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter cf the United Nations."" (resolution 1514 (XV))Those provisions have their basis in the Charter of the United Nations itself. Article 1  paragraph 2  of which states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is""Tb develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples  and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.""A review of some of the provisions of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence t' Colonial Countries and Peoples and of the United Nations Charter is necessary in order to highlight once again the contradiction that exists between the consenting of States to the United Nations and the actual comportment of those States. Everywhere in the world we are witnessing acts of violence  whereas all our actions should be bait towards the search for peace  to such an extent that we cannot help but wonder whether people have not lost sight of the provisions of the Charter  bewitched by the sway of power  whose corollaries are hatred  intolerance and a will to dominate. Contempt for human rights unfortunately prevails throughout the world - in Namibia  in Chad  in Western Sahara  in Kampuchea  in Afghanistan  in the Middle East  in Korea  in Central America.More than ever before  the problem of the right of peoples to self-determination exists in Namibia  a Territory that should have been independent long ago. All peace-loving States  all States for whom human rights and the rights of peoples have any meaning at all  should join efforts to see that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is finally implemented to bring about the self-determination of the Namibian people and their independence.In Chad  part of that country's territory is still under foreign domination. The Government of Togo  which welcomes the fact that most of the opposition groups have rallied to the legal Government in N'Djamena  hopes that soon all the people of Chad will regain control over the whole of their territory within internationallyrecognized borders so that peace and concord can finally be reestablished. That is our wish for that suffering people in this International Year of Peace.Still in Africa  the Sahraoui people are seeking self-determination. Their right to self-determination has been recognized by all  and the adoption of resolutions to that end by the United Nations General Assembly and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) can only speed up the process of self-determination. My Government welcomes the efforts being made by the former Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  Mr. Abdou Diouf  and by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to implement the provisions of those resolutions. It appeals to the patties concerned to return to negotiations under conditions appropriate to reaching a peaceful solution to that conflict.Two other peoples are victims of the violation of their rights and the principles of the Charters the peoples of Kampuchea and of Afghanistan. My country has followed with great interest the development of the situation in Kampuchea. By heroically continuing their struggle to resist the impressive forces deployed by the foreign occupying troops  the Kampuchean people have given us proof of their staunch determination to live in freedom and to recover the peace wrested from them. It is that determination for peace that explains the creation of the tripartite coalition led by Principe Sihanouk for the purpose of exploring new means of prevailing upon the occupying Power to withdraw and thereby put an end to an occupation that flouts international law and the principles of the Charter. As a country of peace and dialog  Togo has always hoped for a speedy resolution cs the problem of Kampuchea. Accordingly  it has always supported the wise proposals of the General Assembly and of Prince Sihanouk  which seek merely bring about respect for the principles of the Charter in order that the peace to which the Kampuchean people are entitled can be reestablished. Determined to regain thatlost peace  the Kampuchean people has made yet another proposal  consisting of 8 points  formulating the conditions necessary to a peaceful settlement of the problem. That proposal - and we cannot overemphasize this - is inspired by the sincere desire of the people and coalition Government of Kampuchea led by Prince Sihanouk - to whom we pay a resounding tribute for his deep sense of humanity - to find a political solution to the problem. The proposal is based on the principles of our Organization and has been reflected in the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in recent years.The Government and people of Togo would like to express their support for the latest proposal of the Kampuchean people and hopes that it will meet with a favorable response so that peace can return to that region in this year when our Organization is celebrating the International Year of Peace. In this year of peace  the international community must support that proposal in order to resolve a problem that has dragged on for far too long.The same is true of the situation in Afghanistan. There too a people that wishes only to live in peace has for more than six years suffered from a situation of war. The foreign troops  which will go to any lengths to establish their domination  must withdraw from Afghanistan. The Organization must do its utmost to see that the relevant resolutions adopted are implemented. The indirect negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan are aimed at resolving the problems of millions of Afghans who have fled their homes in search of peace in neighboring countries.It is time  therefore  for all foreign troops to withdraw from that country. Such a withdrawal would mean that the refugee question could be resolved at the same time. The announcement by the Soviet authorities that some of those troops would soon be withdrawn is a sign of goodwill to resolve the problem. We hope thatthe occupying troops can soon be completely withdrawn so that the Afghan people may fully enjoy their rights.In the Middle East we must face the fact that the diplomatic efforts to resolve the region's problem have been futile. That problem  which revolves around the question of Palestine  the Israel-Arab conflict and the civil war in Lebanon  must be resolved within the framework of an international conference  which we favor. The problem of the Middle East is one of the most serious challenges to the credibility of our Organization. The evolution in the relations between the various parties involved and concerned gives rise to some glimmer of hope that the problem may be settled. In order to achieve a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the region  guaranteed by the two great Powers and other interested States  in particular France and the United Kingdom  the international conference on Palestine must find a solution to three main questions: first  the creation of a Palestinian State on the basis of the General Assembly resolution on the partition of Palestine; secondly  withdrawal from the territories occupied since 1967 and  thirdly  the right of all State in the region  including Israel  to live in peace within secure and recognized borders.It is essential that solutions be found to these questions without delay  which-are the core of the Palestinian problem. This eternal question of Palestine is made even more painful and difficult because of the exacerbation of the clashing antagonisms in Lebanon. Armed confrontations between opposing factions in that couitry continue to prevent a halt in the civil war. One cease-fire agreement follows another without being kept  and the people permanently chained to a powder keg. UNIFIL should be allowed to discharge its mandate properly so that our Organization can attain the basic goal for which it was established. There must be more dynamic  more honest  more direct co-operation among the Powers concerned with the Lebanese leaders so that peace can be finally restored to that country. He appeal to the Lebanese themselves to look beyond their rivalries and contemplate healing the wounds they are inflicting on a country that used to be universally admired. In that context Togo welcomes the agreement reached on 3 September between Muslims and Christians to adopt a national charter to put an end to 11 years of civil war.Not far from the Middle East  in South-West Asia  two brother countries continue their terrible gladiatorial struggle. At a time whet people are becoming aware of the need to strengthen co-operation among States  it is regrettable that the excesses of nationalism which have led to war between two States which should live in peace continue to keep them away from the negotiating table. The Iran-Iraq war  which is entering its seventh year  is a pointless war  and it is high time that the protagonists took stock of the great loss of human life and material damage  and realized that hopes of military victory are illusory. The efforts of the Secretary-General  of the Islamic conference and of countries that have good relations with the two brothers who are now enemies must be encouraged  so that this International Year of Peace that we are celebrating can have some meaning for the peoples of Iraq and Iran.Once again from this rostrum  cm behalf of the Government and people of Togo  we appeal to the authorities in Iran and Iraq to think of their peoples  whose only wish is to live in peace. As President Eyadema has said:""May universal peace reign so that the enormous resources now being devoted to war can be released and so that a world of true fraternity can be established  a world of equal justice for all where the dignity of the human person is respected."" The arms merchants also should endorse that wish and supplying weapons to that theater of war. We wish to reaffirm our support for the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General  and would urge him to continue them in order to bring about a peaceful settlement of the conflict.Elsewhere in Asia the Korean people has been divided for more than 40 years. How much longer will families remain separated? Does the international community wish to endorse that accidental and temporary partition? We do not think so  and we are convinced that all sides will learn from past mistakes. In that context  my Government has doubts about the advisability of admitting the two Koreas to the United Nations. To admit them as separate Mentors of the Organization would create a situation identical to one that we are all familiar with  that is the consolidation of two separate States and the acceptance of a de facto situation  which would be a serious obstacle to the reunification desired by the Korean people.It is to be hoped that the obvious desire of the North Koreans for dialog with a view to reunification should receive a favorable response from the parties concerned  so that the three-point plan that they propose  which is intended to lead to the establishment of a democratic federal republic of Roryo  where at a first stage each of the two Koreas would maintain the regime of its choice  before moving on to the final stage of reunification. We reaffirm our support for thatplan. We hope that the meetings that have taken place between various humanitarian and economic bodies in the two countries can continue and be taken a stage further  so that there can be a speedy settlement of this question and peace can be restored in the Korean peninsula.In Central America the situation has continued to worsen  endangering peace and security in that part of the world. It is regrettable that the efforts made by the Contadora Group to end the fratricidal conflict have not met with the hoped for response. If this situation continues it will considerably weaken and even rule out any chance of a negotiated solution to the problems of the region. Once again  Togo appeals to the good will of the parties concerned  and urges them to respect the principles and purposes of our Organization so that peace can be .restored to the region.To add to the grim picture of the political situation  as if the misfortunes besetting our earth were not sufficient  another scourge is threatening us all  and is becoming increasingly dangerous every days international terrorism. It is not without reason that the media consider it the plague of our times  because it strikes without discrimination  leaving innocent victims  and sowing destruction and desolation along its path. Terrorism is a crime against humanity  whether committed by individuals  groups  or states and whatever the alleged motives. Terrorists are criminals and must be combated and condemned as such by the international community at large. The very survival of organized society is at stake. Togo adds its voice to all those throughout the world who have condemned this scourge and we call upon all States to engage in close co-operation to put a speedy end to it.An analysis of the various situations we have just reviewed clearly shows that these have come about only because of weapons. Undoubtedly the needs of nationaldefense seem to justify the existence  equipment and the maintaining of armies by every nation  but unfortunately these needs encourage the trade in arms at the expense of the social  humanitarian and ethical considerations which should prevail over the arguments of profit and over political and ideological motives. Unfortunately  we are witnessing a frenzied arms race which is increasing the prospect of our own destruction  the destruction of mankind  whom we are striving to protect. How far will human vanity lead us before we understand  as President Eyaderaa has said that""The shot that emerges from the gun causes indiscriminate casualties among the population. The nuclear bomb does not distinguish between developed or underdeveloped countries  when chemical and bacteriological weapons are released  they do not select their victims* they strike indiscriminately. The frenzied nuclear arms race is a threat to all mankind  rich and poor  developed and less developed.""We must all commit ourselves to ending the arms race  inter alia  by giving active support to the World Disarmament Campaign.In this context my country is sparing no effort  and our desire to provide the headquarters for the United Nations Regional center for Peace and Disarmament clearly reflects that commitment. We sincerely thank the whole international community for the choice of Togo to host this important regional center. We are counting on the generosity of all peace-loving nations to contribute to the smooth running of the center. We have offered material facilities and a financial contribution to allow the center to start its work. We are counting on the good will of other States. Peace is a joint asset that all States must try to safeguard in all regions of the world. We should stress the role of the two super-Powers inthe maintenance of that peace. Thus it is to be hoped they will be able to agree on a formula for peaceful compromise in which star wars and star peace can be harmonized  so that the resources released as a consequence of the abolition of all the arsenals can be allocated to the development of States  and bring about the prosperity that our peoples desire.Hundreds of millions of people are now living in total destitution and cannot meet their essential needs for a normal life offering them enough food and a modicum of clothing  water  a roof over their heads  and so on. Hundreds of millions of people are prevented from enjoying most of the basic and inalienable human rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At the same time  part of humanity  basically in the developed countries  is living in comfort and abundance. This injustice must be redressed and humanity must find a solution to this situation by contemplating a system of international co-operation able to eliminate the serious disparities in today's world and to establish a just equitable world  economic and social order  where people have the same chances of development.More than 12 years ago the Member States of the united Nations  anxious to remedy the serious crisis besetting the world  decided  following the sixth special session of the General Assembly  to think about establishing a just  equitable international economic order. That order would replace the obsolete laws that governed international economic relations and put an end to widespread exploitation and confusion.Today  more than a decade since its adoption  the program of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order is a dead letter  because of the selfishness of the developed countries  which are still clinging on desperately to some of their prerogatives.The North-South dialog  which should have been established between rich and poor countries to ensure harmonious growth of the world economy has become in most cases a confrontation where all kinds of interests clash.Thus the widespread crisis  which has been going on for so many years  still goes on  even if some industrialized countries have at some point noted a few vague signs of recovery. However  it is clear that a world economic recovery cannot really be brought about at the expense of the developing countries  and it would be an illusion on the part of some developed States to wish to build their prosperity on the ashes of the poor nations.The many hard-working poor people in the third world are indubitably full' partners on the international economic chess board  whose just remuneration is essential for the recovery of the world economy.The countries of the North must fully realize the interdependence of all economies whether developed or developing. They must take all proper action to put an end to disorder and the uncertainty marking international economic trade  which so strikingly affect third world economies.Everything should be done to halt the present order based on the phenomenon of dependence  which derives from the unequal relationships that emerged in colonial history.This order  which was imposed on developing countries at the time when most of them suffered from colonial subjugation  is the main obstacle to their growth and keeps them  even after they have won independence  in the role of supplying raw materials and purchasing of manufactured products. Thus  the third world countries have been lagging behind the rich countries and are feeling even more acutely the after effects of the crisis and do not have any dynamism of their own to resist it. Whereas the prices of commodities that they export and which generate most of their financial resources are collapsing  the prices of the manufactured products that they import are sky-rocketing  causing a serious deterioration in the terms of trade.The development efforts undertaken by the poor countries have thus been nullified  whereas their indebtedness is increasing beyond all tolerable limits.This chronic indebtedness  which is for our peoples a very heavy burden  would not be so serious  so crushing  so difficult to bear  if the forces that are completely beyond our control  did not exploit the interest and exchange rates of certain strong currencies.Impelled by a desire for profit  these forces no longer realize that the question of paying off our debts is intimately linked with an improvement in the socio-economic situation of our countries. Is it not time for the donor countries to bring about a better organized financial and monetary system? Is it not important that in order to recover their credits in good time they should contribute to the recovery of our economies  effectively giving assistance to our industrialization  enabling us to produce and to sell  by seeking to bring about the disappearance of protectionist measures preventing our products from access to the markets of the developed countries.The world  for several years  has been going through a difficult period  where only mutual understanding and solidarity among all nations  both large and small  is the proper course of action.The thirteenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly  held from 27 May to 1 June of this year  which stressed the critical economic situation in Africa  doubtless created better awareness of the effects of the international crisis on the African economies in the minds of all Member States which joined in devising ways and means to assist Africa. That session was timely indeed and it can never be over-emphasized that our continent  which has the sorry privilege of having two thirds of the least-developed countries  and where poverty seems to have found fertile grounds  is suffering indescribable difficulties  not only because of the widespread crisis  but because of the drought  desertification and famine.The particularly disquieting situation in Africa was eloquently described in the document submitted by the African states and in the statement made by President Diouf of Senegal  who was then Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). We do not intend to describe that again.We would merely here welcome the fact that the priority program for the economic recovery of Africa  1986-1990  was taken into account in the program of Action adopted by the General Assembly.In keeping with that program of Action  African States have undertaken to finance national and regional development programs of a socio-economic nature  and the international community has expressed its will to support and supplement their efforts.The African countries  as was reaffirmed at the last session of the Conference of Reads of state and Government of the OAU  will respect their commitment because they have understood that they themselves must take their own destiny into their own hands before requesting assistance from the international community.It remains for that community to show solidarity with Africa and ipso facto show proof of its resolve to promote international co-operation  which would benefit all States without exception. The interdependence of nations in the world requires that after Africa  certainly an under-developed continent  the efforts of the international community should turn to other poor regions and should consider the establishment of a just  equitable economic order. All necessary initiatives must be taken here  because the dignity of the human race  and indeed the future of peoples are at stake.We are mindful of what President Eyadema said:  ""Today the development of science and technology has brought people onour earth closer together and has given developed nations amazing means to bring about spectacular changes in our lives. But what would be the point of this progress  the result of so much intelligence and work by the human community were these changes not to include as a prerequisite in their goals  the overall development of the human condition?""The peoples of the third world for their part are firmly resolved to rally round and to increase co-operation among the developing countries  to supplement north-south co-operation.This south-south co-operation which is now indispensable for many reasons  will be strengthened for the well-being of the poor nations.Here  my delegation welcomes the results of the high-level meetings of the Group of 77 on economic co-operation among developing countries  held in Cairo in August  and the summit conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Harare.We commend the decisive action of the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement for south-south co-operation and thus of the socio-economic emancipation of the poorest countries.It is also appropriate to pay a well-deserved tribute to the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system  among others  the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the United Nations Development program  which have been making a very useful contribution to the promotion of economic and technical co-operation among developing countries. This tribute is also extended to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  which has been making decisive and effective efforts to stave off famine and to ensure self-sufficiency in food in the countries of the third world.More than ever before  in this Year of Peace  a campaign of publicity and persuasion is needed to induce States to assume their full responsibilities to mankind  in keeping with the principles of the United Nations Charter and with human rights  in order to bring about the development of all peoples in peace and harmony. The celebration of the International Year of Peace should be an opportunity for us to question our own conduct so that it can be directed towards achieving that peace. We must regain our faith in our Organization and its principles so that we can effectively create a world where all peoples  while respecting the differences between them  can decide in complete freedom on the forms of association that they need to work on a basis of complementarity  in dignity and peace  for their happiness.Peace to all Members."
"132",6782,"THA",41,1986,"Sir  it is  indeed a great pleasure for me  on behalf of the delegation of Thailand  to extend  to Ambassador Choudhury our warmest congratulations  on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are highly gratified at the honor bestowed on one of Asia's most distinguished sons from Bangladesh  a third world Member and a friendly country with which Thailand enjoys cordial relations and close co-operation. We are confident that  with his political wisdom  proven diplomatic skills and vast experience  the Assembly's deliberations will be constructive  and lead to a fruitful conclusion.I should also like to pay a tribute to Mr. Jaime de Pinies  President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly  for the exemplary manner in which he presided over that historic and eventful session. His qualities of leadership  dedication  and wisdom have thus earned our respect  admiration and gratitude.Hy delegation would also like to extend our warm felicitations to all the Vice-Presidents  who represent the different regions of the world  reflecting thereby the universality of our Organization.The delegation of Thailand pledges its full co-operation with the President and all the Vice-Presidents who are entrusted with the responsibility of guiding the deliberations of the General Assembly.During the past 12 months there have been extraordinary events which have given rise to concern and hope. In the course of history  sane years bear the stamp of certain dominating events or series of events for which they remain memorable. I fear that the past year may be remembered as an unfortunate year for the number of large-scale disasters  both natural and man-made  which have struck different places in different forms. We recall the sadness brought on by drought  famine and locusts in Africa  the Chernobyl incident  the Challenger accident  terrorist attacks against civilian targets  and the tragic calamity in Cameroon  all of which meant suffering  death and devastation. These catastrophes demonstrate how fragile the human condition is and the extent to which we are all susceptible to shattering blows by natural calamities or malfunctioning technology. However  it is adversity of this kind which often emphasizes the common bond of humanity that unites us and places in true perspective the barriers dividing us. We have seen this reflected in the generous outpouring of sympathy  solidarity and support from the world at large to the peoples of the afflicted nations. Thailand wishes to express once again its sympathy to the Governments and peoples affected.Apart from these disasters  the international situation remains charged with tensions and uncertainties. Although some developments  during the past year  have generated optimism  it cannot be said that the past year has witnessed any significant resolution of problems or issues confronting mankind Indeed  the lack of major progress is distinctly disappointing and in direct contrast to the obvious urgent need for solutions. Among the central issues confronting the international community today are the nuclear threat and the plight of the Namibian  the Palestinian  the Afghan  and  in my own region  the Kampuchean peoples.In looking at our world today  it is hard to remain an optimist. Many problems confronting us appear to be insurmountable. There is a great temptation for us to let go and rely exclusively on fate.My Government has done its best to resist such temptations. We are determined not to be passive. We feel that the lack of international justice is a major contribution to international conflict. There can be no lasting peace without justice.We do not have much time. As the world population grows  the fight for limited resources will intensify. With advanced weapons technology  it is now possible for mankind to destroy itself and all future generations in an instant. We urgently need an equitable system to redistribute the world's limited resources. We urgently need to lead mankind away from total destruction.We need a new world order of peace and justice under which all nations can co-operate with one another and live in harmony. Our world is at present a divided one. Members of the developed North perceive that their interests are threatened by members of the developing South  and vice versa. The same applies to the East and the West. We do not have much time left. If we do not stop fighting and join our hands together now  we may not live to see another opportunity.International co-operation was once desirable; it is now vital for our survival. In our interdependent world  inter-State relations are no longer zero-sum. One country's gain is no longer another country's loss. When the international community gains  each member will gain.My delegation feels that justice is a prerequisite for peace. We must work together to promote international justice. As a developing country and a steadfast member of the Group of 77  we share the common concerns of all other developing countries. We feel that there is a lack of justice in the relationship between the North and the South. We must put an end to this. Most importantly  we must tackle our problems through mutual understanding. We must give and take. A new world order of peace and justice can come about only through understanding and a willingness to compromise. We do not want to destroy the existing international order. We want to improve it. We want to work from within to render the international order more just and therefore more peaceful.In our interdependent world  the North cannot live without the South; the South cannot live without the North. We are all in the same boat. We must work together or sink together.A new world order of peace and justice requires all States to observe strictly the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law. My delegation is deeply concerned about the growing gap between what States say and what States actually do. All States have proclaimed their acceptance of the principle of non-intervention. All States have proclaimed their support for the principle of non-use of force in international relations. All States have proclaimed their respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other States. However  the actual behavior of some States has proved otherwise. We must bridge this gap. We must make certain that our deeds complement our words. We must make certain that our deeds will reinforce our stated desire to see peace and justice.Keeping in mind the urgent need for understanding and compromise  my Government has pursued the firm policy of promoting objectivity and moderation in international relations. Let us look  for example  at our activities in the Security Council. The end of this year will see the end of our first two-year term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. As a member of the Council  we have had to make many difficult decisions. Each decision has been guided by our firm adherence to the principles and purposes oS the United Nations Charter and the rules of international law. Furthermore  our activities have been guided by our desire to promote objectivity and moderation in the Council's decisions.We are in a unique position. We enjoy excellent relations with developed countries although we are a member of the third world. We are not part of the West nor of the Socialist bloc. We are not a member of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries although we do share its basic values and principles. In this unique position  we have served the third world and the international community in a positive way by helping to bridge the gap among conflicting groups of countries.During our term on the Security Council  we have offered several suggestions aimed at improving the Council's ability to maintain international peace and security. Today  we should like to offer another suggestion. Keeping in mind the unavoidable linkage between regional and global peace and security  my delegation would like to see the United Nations establish and maintain regional mechanisms to serve as an early warning system for the Security Council. My delegation feels that an early warning system of that nature would improve the Council's ability to play an early role as a problem develops affecting the regional peace and security. With such a mechanism in the various parts of the world  the Security Council's role in the maintenance of international peace and security could be enhanced. The Council would be in a better position to act quickly and early before a situation erupted into an international crisis.A new order of peace and justice requires also a viable multilateral mechanism to enhance international co-operation. Our Organization represents the most far-reaching  albeit imperfect  effort in that direction. It is therefore a matter of concern to all Members that the United Nations is facing a serious financial crisis. My delegation hopes that the General Assembly will soon address this important issue in a spirit of give-and-take  taking into account our common goals of efficiency and effectiveness  without losing sight of our common commitment and obligations. The report of the Group of 18 should thus be considered in a constructive manner. As we look at the world economic situation  it is important to state that the world economic outlook has shown little improvement. It has indeed become worse in recent months  especially for the developing countries. The debt burden has hit the hardest at the economic and social foundations of those countries  while market access for their exports is being gradually curtailed in the developed economies.Threats to international peace and security do not come from political and military conflicts alone; they come also from economic factors. The increasing tide of protectionism  together with other unfair trade practices  could lead to a trade war with terrible consequences for all.Developing countries have suffered enormously from the protectionist policy of some industrialized countries at a time when they need to trade to sustain their meager subsistence. Their indebtedness and debt-servicing accentuate their plight more profoundly. Since Thailand is a developing country heavily dependent upon export earnings from food products  agricultural commodities and industrial raw materials for the financing of its social and economic development  it is concerned that in recent years commodity prices have dropped to their lowest levels in more than 30 years. Export subsidies for agricultural products also place us at a disadvantage in the world market  where it is already difficult to compete in a fair manner. The hope of some years ago that economic recovery in the industrialized countries would ease our plight has remained unfulfilled. International efforts to stabilize prices at a level fair to both consumers and producers have not materialized.International trade in textiles in 1977 departed from the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which consider safeguards to be temporary measures to allow for adjustments in the importing countries. That provisional clause  now renewed for another five years  appears to be becoming a more permanent feature as the number of bilateral restraints proliferates through the introduction of more and more categories. The textile industry is the only one in which manufacturing progress has been achieved by a large number of developing countries. Consequently  lack of access to markets in the industrialized countries would have destructive results.In this connection my delegation is gratified that it played its part in the successful launching of the new round of multilateral trade negotiations by the GATT Contracting Parties at their recent Ministerial Meeting at Punta del Este  Uruguay. My delegation is particularly happy that the massive distortion in agricultural trade created by subsidies and import restrictions will for the first time be seriously addressed  and we look forward to an early start on the negotiations in this priority sector  which has so far been given little attention.Thailand considers it to be a matter of great urgency for the interrelationship of such problems  as trade  development  finance and monetarysystems  as well as the indebtedness of developing countries  to lead to a political dialogF between Governments of developed and developing countries and with international financial and banking institutions in order to reach an equitable global arrangement for the relief of the economic plight of developing countries.In the light of the foregoing  my delegation wishes to reiterate its support for the convening of an international conference on money and finance to address many of the issues that are critical even to the developed countries.My delegation joins others in calling for the early revival of the dialog between North and South. Delay in reopening that dialog will lead to a rapid erosion of multilateralism  which will weaken the fabric of international peace and security. We remain committed to the launching of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development  in compliance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 34/138.Thailand attaches great importance to the goal of collective self-reliance through economic and technical co-operation among developing countries  both within its own region and at the global level  under the aegis of the Caracas and Buenos Aires programs of action.The delegation of Thailand is deeply concerned by the gravity of the multifaceted problems facing Africa today and stresses the urgency of the need to provide aid and thus bring about durable solutions. We therefore welcome the resolution on the critical economic situation in Africa  adopted by consensus at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly and hope that all concerned will join in the implementation of that program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. Thailand  for its part  remains committed to participating in the international effort towards a long-term solution  particularly in the areas of agricultural development and food security.The United Nations has declared 1986 International Year of Peace. However  numerous obstacles to peace still exist in our world today.In the Middle East  no progress has been made in the search for a comprehensive peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors. After 39 years the question of Palestine still remains the core of the Middle East conflict. There can be no permanent peace in the Middle East until the question of Palestine is resolved  taking into account the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the legitimate security concerns of all States in the region  including Israel. Thailand wishes to reaffirm its support for the unrelenting efforts of the United Nations and various Member States in the search for a just  comprehensive and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions  particularly Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In this connection we would like to urge all the parties concerned to revitalize the peace process so that a just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian problem may be achieved.Thailand is also in favor of the early convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East to deal with this important matter  in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 38/58 C  39/49 D and 40/96 D.My delegation views the situation in Lebanon with deep regret. The mounting violence and continuing bloodshed in Lebanon  caused by civil strife among the various factions and outside interventions  continue to pose a grave threat to Lebanese sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity.While recognizing the importance of maintaining peace-keeping operations in Lebanon  my delegation wishes to emphasize the need for the speedy and full implementation of Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 509 (1982)  which call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces to the internationally recognized boundaries of Lebanon. Thailand is gravely concerned over the conflict between Iran and Iraq  which has continued unabated for over six years. Thailand enjoys diplomatic relations with both conflicting parties. We wish to see our two friends refrain from any action which would further aggravate the situation. We call upon them to take a peaceful and negotiated route towards resolving their differences.Let roe now turn to Namibia. My delegation commends the special session of the General Assembly on Namibia concluded a week ago. During the special session the delegation of Thailand had an opportunity to reaffirm the Thai Government's position on this important question.In this connection  my delegation fully shares the view that any linkage between the independence of Namibia and the presence of Cuban troops in Angola is unwarranted. Such linkage has been rejected by the Security Council as being incompatible with its resolution 435 (1978). Furthermore  we strongly condemn the apartheid regime in Pretoria for its establishment of the so-called interim Government in Namibia and resolutely denounce it as null and void. My delegation also condemns South Africa's continued use of Namibian territory as the springboard for launching military attacks against and incursions into neighboring independent African States.My delegation wishes to reaffirm Thailand's firm solidarity with the Namibian people in their just and heroic struggle for freedom and independence in a united Namibia under the sole and authentic leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO).World attention is at present focused on the problems of southern Africa  with apartheid as the root cause. The United Nations has played a crucial role in informing us of the plight of the unfortunate people in southern Africa who fall victims to the Pretoria regime's inhumane policy of racial segregation.In view of South Africa's persistent defiance of the relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions  I should like to reiterate ray delegation's support for a world-wide comprehensive system of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa - aimed at bringing to an end that country's apartheid system  its illegal occupation of Namibia and its aggression against neighboring States.It is very important .for my delegation to draw the Assembly's attention once more to the Vietnamese invasion and continued illegal occupation of Kampuchea.Peace and stability in the South-East Asian region cannot be realized unless the States of that region commit themselves to respect each other's sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence. The Vietnamese invasion and illegal occupation of Kampuchea constitute a clear violation of that country's sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence. Vietnamese actions are in blatant violation of international law and the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter.I should like to reiterate once again Thailand's firm conviction that the Kampuchean problem can be settled only through political means  by the parties directly concerned. For this reason  Thailand and the other countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) fully welcome and support the eight-point proposal of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea issued on 17 March 1986. The proposal  in Thailand's view  is comprehensive  reasonable and flexible.While the eight-point proposal has received a positive response from most members of the international community  it is regrettable that Viet Nam has rejected this constructive initiative by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. Moreover  Viet Nam refuses to acknowledge that the Kampuchean problem stems from Viet Nam's illegal occupation of Kampuchea. That is why  despite some unwarranted optimism in certain quarters  there is in reality no emergence of a Vietnamese change of position and thus no prospect for a genuine Vietnamese withdrawal from Kampuchea in the near future. Viet Nam's outright rejection of the proposal is a manifestation of its continuing inflexibility and unwillingness to solve the Kampuchean problem by political means. Thailand strongly urges Viet Namto consider the eight-point proposal seriously and to respond positive!* by engaging in direct or indirect talks with the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea with a view to seeking a political settlement of-the Viet Nam / Kampucheaconflict.At this juncture  ray delegation would like to take .the opportunity to express our deep appreciation to the Chairman of the AdHoc CorJittee of the International Conference on Kampuchea  Ambassador SarrS of Senegal  as well as to the other members of the AdH°£ Committee  for their continuing efforts to find a just and durable solution to the Kampuchean problem in accordance with the mandate entrustedto them by the International Conference on Kampuchea.My delegation would also like to express its deep appreciation for the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative. My delegation urges the United Nations to continue to play its legitimate role in fostering a ' peaceful process within the framework of the Charter for the resolution of thispressing international issue.In commenting on Thai-Lao relations  I should like to stress that our relations are of a special and unique character because our two countries are bound by history  religion  race  culture and language. Even though Thailand and Laos have different political and economic systems  such differences do not deter the . development of good-neighborly Thai-Lao relations. The Thai policy towards Laos has been consistent. The Government of Thailand always regards Laos as a fraternal neighboring country. Accordingly Thailand has carried out several economic assistance projects for Laos. In this context  my delegation wishes to state that any hindrance or misunderstanding which may appear should be settled bilaterally through peaceful means  without any interference from third parties. The refugee problem is one of the most tragic consequences of the Indochinese conflicts. It deserves the close attention of the international community because  in addition to creating individual human suffering  it also has serious consequences for the domestic order  stability and economic development not only of the receiving States but of the entire region  and thus endangers international peace and security.My delegation wishes to stress to the international community that the principle of burden-sharing must remain the cardinal tenet in dealing with the aftermath of an influx of refugees. Not only must the international community do its part in alleviating their burden but it must also try to deal with the root causes of the Indochina conflicts in order to alleviate the refugee problem itself.In that connection  the Group of Governmental Experts on International Co-operation to Avert New Plows of Refugees has presented a report with recommendations. It is my delegation's fervent hope that they will be implemented urgently to avert new refugee situations. At the same time  the international community must continue to pursue every effort to end existing refugee situations by peaceful means.Now let me say a few words on the situation of the Kampuchean displaced persons in Thailand  particularly along the Thai-Kampuchean border. At present there are approximately 250 000 Kampuchean displaced persons stranded in Thailand as a result of the invasion and occupation of Kampuchea by Vietnamese forces and their armed attacks on the Kampuchean civilian encampments along the Thai-Kampuchean border since 1979. The foreign forces have also been trying to prevent those unfortunate people from exercising their right to return to their homeland. They have deliberately planted more than 20 000 land mines on Thai territory near the Thai-Kampuchean border. Moreover  some 23 000 Thai villagers have had to be evacuated from their home villages to safer areas. This situation  if allowed to continue  will increase the already heavy burden on Thailand in the near future.Without a political solution to the root cause of the Kampuchean problem  the international community will be obliged to continue to share the burden.The situation in Afghanistan has disrupted the process of detente. It has  indeed  increased tension in the world. The delegation of Thailand reaffirms its full support for the calls by the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the General Assembly on the urgent need to seek a comprehensive political solution on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and respect for Afghanistan's independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status. It remains the firm conviction of my delegation that it would be in the interest of all the parties concerned to seek a negotiated political solution to the Afghan problem  one which ensured that the Afghan people could determine their own future free from foreign intervention  interference  coercion  subversion or constraint of any kind.As a country of temporary refuge for Kampuchean refugees  Thailand expresses its full support for the continuation of humanitarian assistance to the growing number of Afghan refugees in neighboring countries - in particular  Pakistan  which has had to bear an enormous burden.The prevailing situation in Central America constitutes one of the major focal points of tension both at the regional and international levels. In spite of the efforts of the Contadora Group of countries aimed at securing a negotiated solution to the crisis in Central America  the problems remain unresolved  thus endangering the peace and security of the entire region. In this regard  Thailand supports the tireless efforts of the Contadora Group and its Support Group in Central America It is regrettable that senseless acts of terrorism continue  despite the endeavors of the international community to prevent them. Terrorism has .affected innocent human lives  regardless of nationality. It also jeopardizes friendly relations between States and endangers international peace and security. Therefore  the General Assembly last year  for the first time  unanimously adopteda resolution condemning terrorism and recommending measures to combat it. It is also the firm belief of my delegation that terrorism enjoys no legal justification nor should it be condoned under any circumstances.The arms race in all its aspects  particularly the nuclear arms race  has placed the world's survival in jeopardy. Moreover  advanced technologies are being applied to the deployment of new weapon systems  including those in outer space  resulting in a further increase of tension in international relations.We welcome the declaration of President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev in Geneva last November in which both parties maintained thata nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought"" and agreed to accelerate their negotiations so as to""prevent an arms race in space and to terminate it on earth  to limit and reduce nuclear arms and enhance strategic stability."" (A/40/1070  p.3) Aside from the continuing threat to mankind from nuclear weapons  the dangers stemming from the conventional arms race are also quite apparent. My delegation therefore believes that  while proper emphasis should be placed on nuclear disarmament  adequate attention should also be given to conventional disarmament measures.Thailand is very concerned about the diversion of precious financial  material and human resources from development and welfare to armaments  in both their nuclear and conventional aspects. We believe that if the immense cost of the arms race could be saved the enormous amount of resources involved could be used for economic and social development. My delegation therefore fully supported the decision of the General Assembly at its fortieth session to convene an International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. It is our fervent hope that the Conference will be definitely convened in 1987.Another major threat to mankind is the problem of narcotic drugs. In recent years the danger from illicit drugs has increased by leaps and bounds. Today the situation is much worse  and has reached an alarming stage. Me must now face up to the danger and do everything humanly possible to reduce and eliminate the harm being caused to our human family. Thailand has always shown grave concern over the increasing danger of drug abuse and illicit trafficking  and has taken strong and effective measures to cope with the problem at the national level.The problem also has grave implications at the international level. Thailand has long been a firm and consistent advocate of decisive and concerted efforts at the global level to combat the very serious threats posed by the international drug problem. For that reason  Thailand cc-sponsored General Assembly resolution 40/122  which provides for the convening in Vienna in 1987 of an International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. Thailand is convinced that the success of the Conference will depend on the commitment of all States to co-operate with one another in dealing with this global problem.Having reviewed the various developments around the world  the general outlook appears sombre. It seems that we are all powerless in the face of the numerous crises confronting us everywhere. It is difficult to be an optimist. Yet we cant.ot and must not give up. The urgency is all the more compelling now for us to work together to bring about a new order of peace and justice. We must rededicate ourselves to the task of creating a new awareness of the perils that face us. We must have a new awareness of the vital need for more effective international co-operation  because without it we may not long survive. A new world order of peace and justice is only possible through understanding and willingness to compromise. Yet it must be based on the strict observance of the universally accepted principles and the rule of international law.Thailand believes that  if we join hands and hearts in our common search for a more peaceful and just order in the world  then with perseverance and the political will we shall succeed. We cannot fail  because we owe it to ourselves and to posterity not to do so.In concluding my remarks  Thailand would like to pay a warm tribute to our able and tireless Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  upon whose shoulders fall the heavy task of heading this world Organization  particularly at a time when the Organization is facing a financial crisis. He clearly earns and deserves our continued full support in the performance of his important and very difficult task. For his industry and dedication to the cause of peace  freedom  justice and human progress  we salute him."
"133",6898,"TTO",41,1986," I take great pleasure in extending to Mr. Choudhury the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago on his election as President of this forty-first session of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to his personal experience and diplomatic skill and to the international esteem in which his country is held. This session is called upon to take certain major decisions which will guide our Organization for years to come and we feel assured that his presidency of this Assembly will contribute greatly to the successful conclusion of our deliberations.My delegation joins other delegations in congratulating Ambassador Jaiae de Pinies  who so ably presided over the last session of the General Assembly and the historic special session on the critical economic situation in Africa.We also wish to express once more our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his continued devotion to the cause of peace and his untiring efforts in promoting the role and the effectiveness of the United Nations.Trinidad and Tobago has now entered upon its twenty-fifth year as an independent sovereign State and recently celebrated the tenth anniversary of its status as a republic. It is in this context  as a relatively new State and against the background of recent developments in the conduct of international relations which threaten the sovereignty  security and economic independence of small States  that we address the General Assembly today.Last year  during the cooperation of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations  all Member states of the Organization pledged to do their utmost to strengthen our institution. One year later  the Assembly is taking place under the threatening shadow of a financial crisis which is endangering the viability of the United Nations. .This crisis is but one aspect of a much deeper malaise which could ultimately unravel the very fabric of international political and economic relationships and co-operation so painstakingly woven over the past four decades.Evidence of this malaise is manifested by the increasing efforts to subordinate the sovereignty of the weak to the might of the strong; by the growing trend towards unilateralism with the concomitant undermining of multilateral institutions; by the selective interpretation and application of international law to justify narrow national interests; by the frequent recourse to the threat or use of force in international relations; and by non-respect for the principle of the peaceful resolution of disputes.Meanwhile  trade is impeded by the creation of protectionist barriers; the international economic system is disrupted by the disregard of the key currency nations for the far-reaching effects of their domestic monetary and financial policies; growth and development are inhibited by the inadequacies of the international financial institutions; and developing countries continue to be overwhelmed by external debt.It is paradoxical that all this is taking place at a time when the world has become increasingly interdependent as a result of social  economic  political and technological change. Indeed  now  more than ever  we need to strengthen multilateral institutions  the cornerstones of the international system  which were designed to promote international relations based on the principles of sovereignty  equality  economic justice and the rule of international law.Today  the defiance of the rule of international law  the disregard for resolutions of the United Nations and the imposition of unilateral solutions have only compounded the difficulties of resolving the major issues relating to peace and security in our global society. It is therefore not surprising that so many problems persist and continue to appear on the international agenda  becoming less and less amenable to peaceful solution. Failure to bring these matters to an end must be a source of great concern to all of us in the Organization.Nowhere is this deplorable state of affairs more evident than in South Africa. The degradation and subjugation imposed on millions of South Africans by the racist Pretoria regime have been repeatedly condemned by the international community and the abhorrent practice of apartheid has been declared a crime against humanity. The increasing bloodshed and violence brought about by the ruthless and repressive measures imposed by the Pretoria regime in an attempt to stifle all internal opposition to apartheid have now resulted in an almost universal sense of outrage.Peaceful demonstrations  campaigns of civil disobedience and non-violent action by the oppressed majority in South Africa have been met by ever-increasing repression and brutality. All forms of diplomatic approaches have been rebuffed by Pretoria. Yet resolutions of the United Nations continue to be ignored and the will of the international community flouted with impunity.How many more must die before apartheid is abolished? How many more must die before those countries with the most influence on the Pretoria regime accept that comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions now remain the only effective peaceful means of hastening the demise of apartheid? How many more must die before those States cease to consider as -immoral and utterly repugnant"" punitive sanctions in eradicating a system which they publicly acknowledge to be ""morally wrong and politically unacceptable""? How many more must die? The gravity of the situation in South Africa brings sharply into focus the issue of Namibia's independence. Here is another glaring example of the lack of political will of Member States to implement the resolutions of the United Nations. The overwhelming majority of the members of the international community is convinced that the regime in South Africa will not negotiate in good faith over the independence of Namibia.The United Nations  during its early years of existence  moved with alacrity in the face of aggression to establish a presence in troubled regions of the world. Even today  the Organization has peace-keeping forces in various areas  yet we seem unwilling to take the same action in a Territory which is the direct responsibility of the United Nations. What is more  a plan has already been approved by the Security Council in resolution 435 (1978) for ensuring the independence of Namibia through the holding of free elections under United Nations supervision and control and including the establishment of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). Instead  what do we find? A puppet regime has been installed by racist South Africa and we  the Members of the Organization  stand by seemingly helpless. This is a blemish on the proud record of the United Nations in the area of decolonization which we must act with dispatch to erase.In other regions of the world the increasing unwillingness of States to heed the basic tenets of international relations has led to protracted regional conflicts which appear to be more and more intractable. The tragic conflict between Iran and Iraq continues unabated  decimating the fine flower of youth of both nations  ravaging innocent civilian communities and threatening to spill beyond its present confines thus creating a potentially even more explosive situation. Surely  it is time for a peaceful settlement of this conflict. The situation in the Middle East has not improved and continues to take a course which not only heightens tension and increases instability in that area  but also threatens international peace and security. The problem has been further aggravated by the fact that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has now become the target of attack. This grave development has incalculable consequences for United Nations peace-keeping efforts. UNIFIL must be allowed to discharge its mandate in southern Lebanon in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.With regard to the Palestinian problem  my Government continues to believe that only a negotiated solution which respects the rights of all States in the region to secure boundaries and recognizes the inalienable rights of the Palestinians to a homeland will bring a just and lasting solution to the problems of this region.*Persistent instability in Central America continues to be a natter of grave concern to the region. We are convinced that increasing armed conflict will only serve to aggravate the situation. We therefore urge that the process of peaceful negotiation and dialog be pursued  and in this regard ray Government continues to give its unswerving support to the Contadora peace process which we see as the most effective instrument for securing enduring peace in the region.Trinidad and Tobago continues to believe that the basis for a negotiated settlement in Afghanistan and Kampuchea is the withdrawal of all foreign forces from both countries. In this connection  we support the efforts undertaken by the United Nations to contribute to a settlement of the problems affecting these countries. We also endorse the premise that the peaceful resolution of the Korean problem and the relaxation of tension can result only from direct talks between the two parties. Trinidad and Tobago therefore hopes that substantive dialog between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea will soon resume and continue until a solution to the problem is found.In designating 1986 as ""International Year of Peace "" with the theme ""To Safeguard Peace and the Future of Humanity "" the United Nations recognized not only that the attainment of durable peace required the contribution of every State  but also that it was the responsibility of all States to help to safeguard the future of humanity by reducing the threat of nuclear devastation. Hew ever  the two super-Powers have a special responsibility for bringing an end to the senseless arras race and for concluding agreements which will ultimately lead to arms control and nuclear disarmament. My Government expresses the hope that there will soon be substantial improvement in the climate and the spirit of co-operation between the two super-Powers so that progress can be made on these issues. The overriding importance of nuclear disarmament should not divert our attention from the issue of conventional weapons  the proliferation and sophistication of which have resulted in untold destruction and suffering during the course of local and regional conflicts in the developing world. Experience has shown that the accumulation of weapons does not provide the security it purports to attain  but rather escalates tension  promotes distrust and precipitates conflicts. In a world of increasing material needs and finite resources  man's technological advances should be better utilized to promote development and to eliminate hunger  suffering and want. We look forward to the convening of the International Conference on the Relationship Between Disarmament and Development in 1987  which  we hope  will lead to a clear definition of all aspects of this issue and elaborate measures which will promote the welfare of all peoples.There is a growing awareness of the links between development and peace and security. However  what is needed is the recognition by the developed countries that in an increasingly interdependent world the efforts of all countries will have to be concerted in order to overcome the structural imbalances and inequities of the global economy and that the multilateral institutions have an important role to play in attaining this objective.The present world economic system  which has historically been structured to meet the requirements of the industrialized nations  continues to operate to the disadvantage of the developing countries. These countries  which are still in the main primary producers  now find themselves faced not only with the unprecedented collapse in the prices of nearly all commodities but also with the economic consequences of the fundamental changes that are taking place in the nature of  and demand for  materials in the industrialized countries. Technological advances are making possible not only new materials in substitution for many of the primary products of developing countries but also new uses for these materials in processes to which the primary products cannot readily be adopted. These new materials are already displacing minerals upon which the economies of some developing countries depend for the means of achieving the much desired improvements in the economic and social condition of their peoples.The recent dramatic fall in the price of crude oil has had a devastating effect on the economic situation of oil-producing countries everywhere  forcing many of them to make drastic adjustments in their economies in order to cope with their straitened circumstances  Further  although the lower oil prices may have eased the balance-of-payments position of some developing countries  that benefit has been largely offset by a sharp drop in the transfer of financial resources and in the level of concessional assistance.The developed countries themselves have not escaped the effects of petroleum prices in dramatic decline. Whole regions and cities that at one time prospered  directly or indirectly  through the oil industry  have found themselves faced with serious economic problems. Business enterprises  even banks  have gone bankrupt; unemployment has risen; and governmental and other activities have been adversely affected by declining revenues. It must now  therefore  be generally recognized that a gradual increase in prices to reasonably remunerative levels  not only of oil but also of other primary products  is an essential ingredient in the recovery and stability of the world economy.Efforts made by developing countries to reduce dependence on income from primary products by diversifying their economies and by developing an industrial base have been frustrated by the increasing tendency of developed countries to restrict access to their markets for a wide range of manufactured and semi-manufactured products. My delegation wishes to stress that access to the markets of the industrialized com tries remains crucial to the development prospects of the developing countries. The recent agreement in Punta del Este to convene a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is therefore most welcome. He hope that this new round will result in the removal of protectionist barriers and restrictions which now bedevil international trade.The proper functioning of the international trading system is a necessary condition for monetary and financial stability. The distortion of this system has surfaced as currency misalignments  volatile capital movements and a general failure of the regime of floating exchange rates to establish stability.The key currency countries need to become more aware of their role and  more important  of their responsibility  given the effects of their domestic policies upon the international economic system. For far too long  these countries have adopted policies which have impaired the proper functioning of the international economic system.There is growing recognition that co-ordination and harmonization of interests are crucial to the long-term coherence  viability and vitality of the international economic system. Last year there were signs of a new commitment to growth-oriented policies  lower interest rates  realignment of currencies and closer co-ordination of national policies. Summitry and declarations of intent  however  are not enough.Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that the linkage within the international system demands that existing arrangements be improved and new mechanisms devised to mobilize the participation of all States. Such mechanisms should give full recognition and effect to the reality of interdependence. The international financial institutions  particularly the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank  must play a more progressive role in the international economic system. Those institutions must be equipped with sufficient financial resources and the requisite flexibility to foster the resumption of growth and investment and the reactivation of the development process. This is even more important at this time when access to concessional assistance and other transfers of financial resources have become increasingly difficult. It is imperative  however  that those institutions  while not abandoning short-term solutions  adopt an approach more responsive to the long-term needs of developing countries.There is no more striking illustration of the inequities and imbalances of the international economic system than the staggering dimensions of the external debt of the developing countries  which is now in excess of $700 billion. The most important factor influencing the dramatic and inexorable growth in indebtedness has been exorbitant rates of interest unilaterally imposed. Each debtor nation thus finds itself cast in the role of a modern-day Sisyphus  even more overwhelmed today by a debt which it thought it had lessened the day before.Developing countries  laboring under the harsh measures of internal adjustments necessary to settlement their external debt commitments  now find themselves in the paradoxical position of being net exporters of capital to the developed creditor countries. Should such an anomalous situation be allowed to persist  it will impede growth and development in the developing countries and will result in political and economic instability  the ripple effect of which would be felt across the entire international spectrum.The adjustment of national economies and the rescheduling of debts  however innovative  will not provide a lasting solution but will only cause the system to muddle from crisis to crisis. That seemed to have been sensed last September at the annual meeting of the World Bank and the Fund at Seoul  when the need for a new and comprehensive approach to the problem of external indebtedness was identified. Trinidad and Tobago will therefore support any effort or initiative to promote a structured intergovernmental dialog which will involve commercial banks and the international financial institutions.Declining economic activity in developing nations has created a number of serious human problems. In most developing countries the youth constitute the largest percentage of the population. There must be adequate opportunities and options for their creative energies  aspirations and idealism. Depressed economies inhibit opportunities for the young and frustrate their potential. Only a vibrant  expanding world economy and an orderly international political system can contribute to the full realization of the hopes and aspirations of our future generations.The United Nations has a crucial role to play in the resolution of social  political and economic problems which beset the international community. It is therefore necessary to strengthen its structure and its mechanisms and to review continually the programs and activities of the Organization to ensure that it keeps pace with the demands of a constantly changing global society while retaining its effectiveness. The report of the Group of 18 has raised many fundamental and sensitive issues. In its report  the Group attempts to provide a frank appraisal of the factors that have led our Organization into its present difficulties and to provide a range of far-reaching measures that could undoubtedly enhance its efficiency and integrity.My delegation will participate fully at the appropriate time in the deliberations on the recommendations made by that Group. However  we wish to sound a note of caution. In seeking the necessary improvements  we must ensure that we do not impair the structure and mechanisms we have nurtured to achieve the goals of the United Nations. That is the spirit in which Trinidad and Tobago will approach the search for greater financial and administrative efficiency. We must emphasize  however  that the decision-making process of the United Nations must not be vested only in those who desire to preserve their political and economic preeminence. It must accord with and give full recognition to the principle of the sovereign equality of all States.There are difficult times ahead of us. In addressing the question of the responsibility of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security  it has become fashionable to assert that the Organization must be made more effective if its credibility is to be maintained. We must recognize  however  that it is we  the Member States  who constitute the United Nations. The responsibility for the effectiveness of the Organization devolves upon every single one of us. It is in the discharge of that collective responsibility that the strength and effectiveness of our Organization will be enhanced. It is upon a strong and effective United Nations that States  particularly small States  rely as a guarantor and protector of their sovereignty and independence. Member States must therefore comply with the obligations of the Charter  observe scrupulously the fundamental tenets of international relations and respect unreservedly the equality and sovereignty of all Members of our international community. If we do not  theUnited Nations system will weaken and collapse  parochial interests based on force will become paramount and anarchy and chaos will be the order of the day.Last year the special session to commemorate the first 40 years of the Organization provided a welcome opportunity for us to pause in our annual deliberations as an Assembly  to reflect upon our achievements and our failures. It was a salutary pause that should both have refreshed and reinvigorated our Organization  enabling us as it did to draw encouragement and inspiration from the achievers its and to profit from and take to heart the lessons of the failures  in preparation for the greater tasks that still lie ahead of us.As we move towards the twenty-first century  let us not do so with our minds and eyes focused on the past. Let us  rather  drawing upon the wisdom and experience of the past and ever conscious of the awesome responsibility that history has entrusted to us as Members of this Organization  press forward confidently  but with humility  with our efforts to help shape a better  brighter and safer future for mankind and  in particular  for our youth  to whom we must in due course pass on the torch of the preservation of this planet and of the welfare and progress of its peoples."
"134",6944,"TUN",41,1986," It is a great pleasure for me to be representing Tunisia for the first time in the United Nations and speaking on behalf of Arab and African Tunisia  which is proud of being Arab. I take pleasure in congratulating you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency c . *he forty-first session of the General Assembly  which demonstrates the great respect in which Member States hold you. My delegation is convinced that your well-known qualities as a diplomat  your great experience and your wide knowledge of the United Nations will prove most valuable as you guide our deliberations on the important and complex items on our agenda.I should like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  a great friend who was President of the fortieth session of the General Assembly. The qualities of leader ship  dedication and wisdom that he demonstrated in presiding over the fortieth session earned him our deep and lasting gratitude.I wish to say to Mr. Perez de Cuellar  our Secretary-General  how very glad we are to see him among us once again completely recovered and resuming his work with all the dedication and sagacity that he has always displayed. We congratulate and thank him for the courage  level-headedness and constructive approach he has demonstrated - particularly in his latest report on the work of the Organization. I should like to congratulate him also on his welcome and decisive contributions in dealing with difficult issues  (continued in French)This session is taking place at a crucial stage in preparations for the major negotiations between the two super-Powers which have been awaited for so many years. We hope that the mishaps along the way that occur from time to time and make us wonder whether those negotiations will ever take place will not thwart the profound universal aspiration to a better world in which peace  security and progress will prevail. All nations  regardless of their size  attach the greatest importance to these negotiations. Their success will to a large extent depend on the practical response they bring to the super-Powers' overall concerns.Naturally  the limitation of nuclear weapons and a halt to the arms race  particularly in outer space  in favor of collective security that promotes lasting peace and fruitful co-operation will be the main goal of the proposed East-West dialog. The peace-loving nations that seek progress and prosperity  as our own does  can but welcome such a development There is hardly any need for me to recall how indescribably wasteful the arms race is at a time when so many nations are arduously struggling just in order to live and their peoples just in order to survive.Redeployment of finances currently used by some to produce weapons and by others to buy them at inordinate prices towards development projects would contribute immensely to solving growth problems in the third world and also promote the harmonious development of international relations of benefit to all. To this end the American-Soviet negotiations must not be limited to deployment and counter deployment of missiles in Europe; they must also deal with establishing a balance of deterrent systems between the super-Powers. This in itself is not enough  but it is a commendable objective  one we would like to see attained.Already  the news from Stockholm on the agreement reached on specific measures to restore confidence is very encouraging  and we are pleased. We also welcome the constructive aspect of these measures  which constitute the first ray of hope in more than seven years in this difficult process of negotiations on disarmament in Europe.Arms developments are the result of international tensions throughout the world. Any agreement on limitation  banning and reducing military potential  whatever the size of the force involved  must be the result of considerations that go beyond weapons themselves and take account of the whole range of international factors.Foremost among these factors is the right of peoples to self-determination. More than 40 years after the San Francisco Charter was signed  peoples in the Middle East  Africa and Asia still suffer under the colonial yoke or once again find themselves deprived of their freedom. We are not the only ones to be shocked at this and to condemn it. The major Powers themselves say that they are dismayed. All of them are distressed at violations of the Charter involving injustice when it strikes the centers of their own interests.In promoting negotiations between the super-Powers and other Powers  it is surely time now that these problems of freedom and dignity for millions of men and women should be regarded as fundamental problems and that the super-Powers should agree on treating them as such. In other words  they should agree to remove those considerations that have no raison d'etre except their mutual antagonism at the world level. As we see it  the relaxation of tension that is sought does  to a large extent  depend on their just solution in keeping with the inalienable rights of peoples to self-determination.Secondly  world peace is seriously threatened by the interplay of regional conflicts and acts of destabilization. Of course  most of the time  these acts involve local regimes that use violence as their preferred instrument for promoting their hegemonistic aspirations and have recourse to the use of force and aggression to carry out their dark designs  scorning the principles and rules of law governing the international order.Yet  it seems to us that the super-Powers are not entirely free of responsibility. The sorry plight of innocent people in Africa  the Middle East and Asia reduced to a tragic existence of death and devastation should not leave themindifferent. Neither should the cruel dilemma in which many countries find themselves obliged to buy weapons at exorbitant prices  to the detriment of their economies and the social well-being of their peoples. Yet  thanks to their influence deriving from their power and the responsibility they assumed on the world level  the major countries are able to change the diabolical course of events  so that hotbeds are extinguished and negotiations can replace armed confrontation. That is how the super-Powers could increasingly introduce the best remedy to eliminate the scourge of terrorism - individual terrorism and State terrorism - which is also gradually making use of evermore sophisticated weaponry.As everyone knows  one kind of terrorism is but an extension of acts of violence caused by the obstinate refusal to recognize legitimate and inalienable rights of peoples subjected to foreign domination. Having said that  we are in no way trying to justify or excuse terrorism as a loathsome practice? but we feel that one should not neglect one important element in our understanding  one which truth and the reality of the situation make it incumbent upon us to recall. For terrorism is also an extension of acts of violence committed by those who obstinately refuse to accept this aspiration to freedom? and it is also an extension of acts of violence committed by belligerent countries in the vain hopeof exercising some pressure or indeed achieving victory.There is no need for me to emphasize our extremely strong condemnation of terrorism  which  as tragic recent events have unfortunately reminded us  strikes innocent children  women and the elderly. They are innocent victims of conflicts with which they have absolutely nothing to do.It is indeed with real feeling that I refer here to the painful trial imposed on France  in its capital  by blind attacks on innocent persons who  as I say  have nothing to do with the difficult debate on the international scenePrance and its President  its Government and its people  deserve a better response to the contribution they are making to the solution of the problems that are of concern to us all. We condemn terrorism wherever it occurs and will indeed co-operate to prevent such misdeeds and to punish the guilty. But we also believe that we can crush this evil only if we attack it at its roots.Tunisia  an Arab country by reason of its unalterable identity  an African country because of its roots and the way it has taken root  a Mediterranean country through its universal aspirations  is indeed well placed to give expression to some truths relating to the concerns we share in these very perilous times.In the Mediterranean  to begin with  the situation is indeed a threatening one. The Mediterranean has traditionally been described as the lake of peace  and this is the unanimous desire of all the coastal States. It is also the cradle of civilizations that have given mankind so many things to be proud of. Yet  in this area we are witnessing a re-emergence of armed conflicts  open and covert terrorism  things that make this area a favored area for confrontations  increasingly serious in scope and with incalculable implications. Overlying disputes relating to offended nationalism is an East-West antagonism which maintains hotbeds of tension and jeopardizes any possibility of peace. And so  in the final analysis  the goals of the local antagonists are submerged in these greater stakes that go beyond them.The problem of the Middle East  the problem of Palestine  which is undergoing torture  is often subjected to the effects of this East-West antagonism.This problem is at the crux of all the crises in the Arab world  crises that could lead to tragic upheavals affecting society in countries far away from the region. But this does not seem to influence Israel at all*  it is still  blindly  obstinately  considering force and alliances as the exclusive grounds for its rightto drive a people from its lands. How else could one explain that in response to all the proposals made by the Arab side  particularly the Fez plan  in response to all the terms accepted by the Palestinian side  the Israeli side responds with a categorical refusal to engage in any discussion on the basis of a fair and lasting compromise  one that would involve a return of the occupied land  thus ensuring a safe and secure existence for all States in the region?This formula  which is repeated in all international forums  must one day prevail through the understanding of those who realize they cannot let this tragedy go on developing until it threatens the whole weald. In these circumstances and in connection with this tragedy  we must recall the moving words of wisdom and sincerity spoken by President Bourguiba in 1965 in Jericho  when he called for this solution  which is feasible and good for our Palestinian brothers  a solution based on strict international legality  namely the decision of the United Nations.The only thing that can support Israel's refusal is obviously force  military superiority  which enables it to hold to its inflexible position and engage in an armed conflict in which it thinks it will be victorious. But there can be a change in the balance. Force will not necessarily always be a prerogative of just one area and one party. It is military force that enables Israel to invade any country at all in the area  such as Lebanon  under the pretext of guaranteeing its own security  and then to continue occupying the area as long as it feels it is necessary.So for more than four years there has been a new dimension to the problem of the Middle East. This is a new imbroglio that brings increased tragedy  death  fear and anguish  far away from the frontiers of Lebanon.We are analyzing this tragedy without using euphemisms. Sometimes we may sound a little severe  but I think it is quite clear that we have no hatred at all towards Jews living in any part of the world whatsoever  because Jews are our brothers through their origin  and in Tunisia they are our brothers because we have the same national identity. They have the right to regard themselves as full citizens  to live as such and to flourish as such. They are even entitled to respect for their fervent devotion to our common national identity.Our people  and Bourguiba in particular  believe in tolerance and human fraternity. This is well enough known for me not to have to dwell on it here. It is because we refuse to let a racially inspired danger erupt elsewhere in the world that we are pleading for peaceful and reasonable solutions. This is why we want to see some influence from the super-Powers and from the major Powers  in support of restoring the total sovereignty of the Palestinian people with a guarantee for all States in the region to enjoy peace.Do people believe that the East-West dialog can take place while this part of the world is still in flames? And Europe  an integral part of the Mediterranean basin  should surely respond more vigorously in order to restore a just and lasting peace  inspired by that spirit of justice and by the moral values that are the very basis of European democracy.Moreover  this is the only real way in which it can escape from the cycle of violence to which it is being subjected  and the cost in human life and money is beginning to weigh on it. Moreover  would this not be the most effective way of combating terrorism  and then building this economic and culturally complementary whole  this union between the developed European north and the Arab-African south  which is still developing but which has such tremendous potential?The same applies to the situation in southern Africa. A problem of freedom and dignity affecting two peoples  victims of colonialism and shameless racialdiscrimination is increasingly shifting into a conflict with world dimensions  because  on the one hand there are damaging consequences for all countries in the subregion  whose security  stability and supplies of food are being affected  and also because it is leading to a disturbance  if not a rupture  in trade and co-operative relations between the West and the region that is so useful to the economy of the West.Other conflicts bring suffering to other parts of the world. Millions of men and women are deprived of their inalienable right to self-determination and to choose their own kind of government. Bloodthirsty repression follows punitive expeditions and leads to the exodus of millions of innocent people from their homeland.Thus  the situation in Afghanistan remains a tragic stalemate. Tunisia renews its appeal to the international community to take strong action without delay to promote a peaceful solution based on the principles of the Charter  thereby ensuring the withdrawal of foreign troops and respect for the independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan and the right of refugees to return to their homes.The same applies to Cambodia  where the people have been decimated by massacres  war  and disease. Here also our Organization should take firmer action to ensure the withdrawal of foreign troops and respect for the independence and territorial integrity of that country and the right of the people of Kampuchea freely to choose their own future.Important though it is to invite the United States of America and the Soviet Union to undertake negotiations covering all aspects of international tension  including the arms race  this is only one factor  and in highlighting their paramount role in the reduction  if not the elimination  of regional tensions and conflicts we are not in any way minimizing the responsibility of the protagonists in many of the conflicts which are disrupting the third world.The parties involved in the conflicts cannot justify their actions  which are damaging to themselves and to others beyond the area of conflict  by the fact that the super-Powers allow this to happen.The position of Tunisia is clear. It has been stated many times from this rostrum  in other  regional forums and within the framework of the Non-AlignedMovement. Our position derives from our belief  the belief of President Bourguiba  in the freedom of peoples to determine their own future  respect for the sovereignty of nations and peace in a world of brothers dedicated to the well-being of the people.It is in the light of that search for peace that Tunisia is particularly concerned by the tragedy being played out by two fraternal countries. After six years of bitter fighting  bringing death and destruction to Iraq and Iran  those two countries must take the sensible course of peace and negotiation. They must save their human and economic potential from destruction  which could become irreversible. They must realize the danger of this disastrous development of a ridiculous war  condemned to failure for both sides  the real danger of its bringing death and desolation to neighboring countries and of assuming an international dimension  and goes beyond the context of the region  because of the strategic economic interference that could provoke such an extension.Iran in particular must understand that its interest lies in peace  which it ca:: still establish with Iraq  which has already accepted an immediate cease-fire supervised by the United Nations with a view to finding a solution to the conflict in keeping with the principles of international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions.The distressing problems raised by conflicts in other regions far from ours should encourage us to fulfill the wishes of successive generations in the northern part of Africa.Thus  Tunisia is working with faith and determination to bring nearer the blessed day when a united Maghreb will at last be a living reality. Tunisia  at the instigation of President Bourguiba  dean of the Heads of State of the Maghreb  proposed nearly two years ago a Maghreb summit meeting with the objective ofestablishing principles and working out ways and means of bringing about a united Maghreb based on mutual trust  good-neighborliness  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  agreement on matters of common concern and the promoting of co-operation between the States of the region. That meeting  by looking to the future with confidence  is intended to be a valuable opportunity for considering together the problems that are obstacles to the creation of such a Maghreb  and  of course  Western Sahara is in the forefront of our preoccupations.The difficulties that have impeded our initiative will not prevent us from persevering in the patient search for the means of bringing about this Maghreb community to help us solve our common economic problems and fulfill an old hope that has never died. That community will be a model of co-operation and a powerful partner for the other coastal countries in the conception and realization of a policy that will make the Mediterranean an area of brotherhood.Thanks to respect for these principles  realism and the farsightedness of their leaders  faced with the existing problems and the challenge they present  the coastal States of the Mediterranean  from north to south and east to west  will have an opportunity to make their sea  the Mediterranean  which today is prey to all kinds of tension and conflict  a lake of peace  friendship and co-operation. It is time for a spiritual revolution so that confrontation may give way to dialog and quarrels about matters that can now be resolved may cease  to the benefit of the great aspirations the fulfillment of which will determine the future of mankind.We firmly believe that the United Nations has an important role to play in that process  which could lead to the accomplishment of its great cause  which is certainly within our grasp if we take control of events and direct our action towards common objectives in which the interests of one are the interests of all. So we might think about reaching agreement on ways aid means of establishing peace  security and co-operation in the Mediterranean  thereby avoiding any danger of the confrontation that might result from the extreme tensions in this part of the world.Tunisia is making this proposal  and we suggest that it should be considered by all those concerned  in the hope that the idea will make headway at the next session of our Assembly and that specific means of implementing the proposal can be drawn up then.In entrusting to this Organization the realization of our ideas  in choosing it as the best forum for giving effect to them  we are reaffirming our faith in its important task  which as we all know is to reduce antagonism  and to mobilize good will in order to free our world of tension and conflict by the pursuit of the dialog so essential to mutual understanding and to the harmonization of international relations. But if our Organization is to continue this task and bring it to a successful conclusion it must have the means to do so. We are convinced that each one of us will do his best to ensure that means are made available in terms both of material requirements  and of the resolve to reassert the authority of this Organization that has rendered such outstanding service to mankind. As far as Tunisia is concerned  and President Bourguiba  this prestigious Assembly constitutes  as always  the summit of the international legal order. Thus  it has been a pleasure and an honor for me to speak here on behalf of my country  and make the voice of Tunisia heard from this rostrum."
"135",6991,"TUR",41,1986,"I should like to congratulate Mr. Choudhury on his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. I have particular pleasure in doing so since deep-rooted ties of friendship and solidarity have always linked our two nations. Beyond that  I pay a tribute here to a colleague and personal friend of many years with whom we have collaborated in the best spirit. I am confident that he will guide the deliberations of the General Assembly with distinction and skill.May I also pay a well deserved tribute to the President of the fortieth session  Ambassador Jaime de Piniss  she presided ever a session that was an important landmark in the life of the United Nations  as well as the special session on the critical economic situation in Africa. His experience in this Organization has contributed greatly to the work of the General Assembly.I would not wish to fail on this occasion to pay a warm tribute to our Secretary-General  whose admirable efforts in the service of the United Nations on many challenging issues have earned him the widest confidence and support. We are extremely happy to see him in good health at a time when the Organization must count on his judgment and guidance.I new turn to the international situation. The world continues to be burdened with fundamental political and economic problems which await solutions in the interest of the preservation of world peace and stability. Last year  during the fortieth session  we had the opportunity to make a collective assessment of the international situation. The then approaching summit meeting between the United States and the Soviet Onion  as well as the negotiations in Geneva between the two Powers  were the primary factors creating expectations in the international community.Encouraging signs did emerge for East-West relations during the meeting between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev. We consider this summit an important step in the efforts to develop a realistic and comprehensive dialog that could greatly contribute to better understanding and mutually beneficial co-operation between East and West.We particularly welcome the recent announcement made by the United States and the Soviet Union that the leaders of the two countries will be meeting on 11 and 12 October. We hope the meeting will contribute to the creation of a favorable atmosphere which will enable them to effectively address all issues that have a bearing on the maintenance and improvement of international peace and security.We hope that the meeting will promote swift progress on these issues. The continuation of the talks between the United States and the Soviet Union  with the aim of achieving concrete results  especially in the field of arms control and disarmament  is of vital importance. We hope both sides will  with determination  intensify their efforts to achieve a lower and more balanced level of armaments  through substantial reductions in their nuclear weapons. We believe also in the need for reductions in conventional forces and for the total elimination of chemical and biological weapons. By the same token  the aim should be to maintain the security of all the countries of the world and defusing tensions which might lead to conflicts.Turkey has always opted for solving international conflicts through dialog and negotiations. Turkish geo-political realities and historic experience have led to the belief that dialog and negotiations are the only acceptable means of dealing with international disputes.We welcome the agreement recently reached at the Conference on disarmament in Europe as an important achievement in East-West relations. We believe that it will promote greater security in Europe by lessening the risk of war.All the Members of this Organization have committed themselves under the Charter to encourage respect for all without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion. This provision of the Charter is directly related to the purpose of establishing a more humanitarian international order.Contrary to this basic principle of the united Nations  persistent violations of human rights and policies based on racism and racial discrimination have unfortunately continued to cause wide spread misery and suffering.Since the last session of the General Assembly the world has witnessed a rapid worsening of the situation and escalation of tension and violence in South Africa because of the oppressive policies of the Pretoria Government. Moreover  the acts of aggression perpetrated by South Africa against neighboring States constitute a growing threat to the peace and the security of the region.On every occasion Turkey expressed its serious concern for the aggravation of the situation in South Africa. Turkey continues to support and implement the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council regarding measures designed to put an end to the apartheid policy of Pretoria.The continuation of the South African occupation of Namibia as an affront to the principles of self-determination is another deplorable aspect of the problems in South Africa.My Government believes that it is only through a judicious combination of a firm stand by the united Nations and effective international pressure on the Government of South Africa that resolution 435 (1978) can be implemented. In this context  my Government subscribes to the main thrust of the final declaration and the program of action adopted by the International Conference for the Immediate Independence of Namibia  held in Vienna last July. As a founding member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Turkey will continue to give support to the legitimate struggle of the people of Namibia. We also support th efforts of theSecretary-General to serve the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. If South Africa persists in its intransigence  more effective measures and sanctions will be needed.The increasing wave of terror is rapidly becoming a serious threat to every society. We have persistently called for effective international co-operation against terrorism in all its forms. The adoption of resolution 30/61 by the General Assembly last year  which unequivocally conPenned  as criminal  all acts  methods and practices of terrorism wherever and by whomever committed  and urged all States to co-operate in the prevention and combating of terrorism  was an important step in this direction.The most significant feature of that session of the General Assembly was the unanimity achieved in condemning international terrorism and in calling for effective measures to combat it. Turkey is certainly a country which feels great satisfaction over this development since it has been demolishing the scourge of terrorism from this rostrum for more than a decade. For many years our pleas and warnings were not heeded. But the recent tragic events and the proliferation of terrorist acts finally lead to the awareness that no country is immune from terrorism and that only effective international co-operation can curb it.In this connection no less effort should be devoted to the fight against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking. The reports of the United Nations bodies active in the field of drugs  as well as national drug enforcement agencies all over the world  draw attention to the unprecedented increase in these activities. We consider drug trafficking as the natural ally of international terrorism.We are  nevertheless  encouraged by the world community's growing awareness of this deadly menace and we note with satisfaction the renewed desire expressed by Governments to address this problem through concerted efforts. In this respect  we hope that the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  which is scheduled to take place in June next year  will create a unique opportunity for establishing a more effective international framework for concerted action  ready to address all aspects of the drug problem.The new convention on illicit drug trafficking is also a positive initiative by countries which have recently become aware of the seriousness of drug trafficking. We look forward to the drafting of a comprehensive convention covering all aspects of trafficking  particularly its close link with international terrorism.My Government attaches great importance to the world-wide respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Moreover  we insist on the strict observance of bilateral and international agreements guaranteeing the rights of national minorities. For the past two years  the Turkish Government has called for bilateral negotiations to resolve  within a humanitarian approach  the grave situation faced by the Turkish Muslim minority in Bulgaria. The international community is fully aware of the plight of the 1.5 million people concerned. We continue to believe that this question can be effectively addressed and resolved through dialog between Turkey and Bulgaria. The Turkish Government is determined to pursue this humanitarian question.Since last year  despite some encouraging initiatives  the situation in the Middle East has not taken a turn for the better. It continues to pose a serious threat to the peace and security of the region and the world. Some opportunities which seemed to exist last year for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East have apparently diminished. The fundamental problem  however  is still there to be addressed with common sense and vision if the tension vAich plagues the region is ever to be defused. We continue to believe that a just and lasting comprehensive settlement in the Middle East depends on recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and withdrawal by Israel from Arab territories under its occupation since 1967  including Jerusalem. We also believe that the problem will not disappear until all its interrelated elements are taken up and resolved in a manner that takes into account the legitimate rights and interests of all the parties involved.We have followed with interest the recent efforts to reactivate the peace process  and we certainly hope that they will be successful and that a formula acceptable to all parties concerned will finally be found.We are deeply disturbed and concerned at the situation in Lebanon  which has continued to be the scene of violent incidents. We maintain the hope that the Lebanese people will find the path leading to national reconciliation  without which there can be no serious remedy for the problems that they have been facing for so long.An important dimension of the situation in the Middle East is clearly that of inter-Arab relationships. We earnestly hope that greater cohesion will prevail.During the past year the war between Iran and Iraq has escalated and caused further devastation and human suffering. We are deeply distressed by that tragic war between our two neighbors and friends. We continue to maintain strict neutrality  as well as a dialog with both sides  and remain available for any assistance we can provide towards a peaceful solution.The situation in Afghanistan continues to be a major cause of tension in international relations. Agony has been inflicted on that Islamic nation. A peaceful solution in Afghanistan would not only bring peace to that nation butalso be beneficial to regional stability and have a favorable impact on the general course of international relations. The elements of a comprehensive solution have long been identified and developed into political instruments through the laudable efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative. The Geneva negotiations on Afghanistan have become a testing ground for the chances of a transition from military confrontation to political realism. This process has reached a crucial point  which necessitates firm steps being taken towards an overall agreement.In South—E*at Asia  the plight of the Kampuchean people is another focal point of world public opinion. The key to a just and lasting political settlement in Kampuchea is the exercise by the Kampuchean people of its inalienable right to self-determination. We consider the eight-point proposal for a political settlement of the problem of Kampuchea made by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea on 17 March 1986 and supported by the Association of South-East Asian Nations to be a positive step.I wish to stress again the significance we continue to attach to the endeavors towards an effective dialog on the Korean peninsula. We believe that this is the only way to remove the mistrust that exists between the two sides and gradually move towards the creation of an atmosphere in which solutions can be sought to all inter-Korean questions. We hope the two sides will continue to work for such a process and develop the conditions which can lead to their representation in the United Nations.Despite the efforts made by the Contadora Group and its Support Group to bring about an equitable and lasting solution to the problems in Central America  the ongoing tension in that region is yet another source of concern to the international community. The final version of the Contadora Act  prepared by the joint endeavors of the Contadora Group and its Support Group  is  in our view  of great significance in the search for a negotiated solution.We continue to support the mission of good offices with regard to Cyprus of the United Nations Secretary-General and appreciate his recent efforts. We note with satisfaction the prompt acceptance by the Turkish Cypriot side of the draft framework agreement submitted on 29 March 1986 by Mr.Perez de Cuellar after intensive contacts over several months with both sides. We regret  however  that the Greek Cypriot side has turn down that document  which represents the cumulative outcome of a process that started more than two years ago  in August 1984  in Vienna.The draft framework agreement contains the principles and parameters which should guide the negotiations between the two sides in Cyprus. That framework is the result of two years of effort by the Secretary-General to reconcile the views of the two parties. It did not come as a surprise to either party since it was discussed with them in a detailed manner before it was formally presented by the Secretary-General. It is normal that neither of the parties is entirely happy with it  but the Turkish Cypriot side has accepted it in a spirit of conciliation and compromise and without any illusions as to the difficulties which will emerge during the negotiations. It has accepted it because the draft agreement reflects a reasonable balance between opposing views and delicately interconnected problems.The Turkish Cypriot side has proved its goodwill and its desire for the final resolution of the Cyprus problem. The Greek Cypriot side should seize this opportunity. It should realize that  in view of the evolution of the Cyprus problem  acceptance of the draft framework agreement is a sine qua non of meaningful negotiation.On the international economic scene  during the past year we have witnessed a deceleration of the limited economic recovery seen in 1983 and 1984. Increases inworld output and world trade remained disappointingly low  resulting in the introduction of further protectionist measures. More recently  there has been some improvement in short-term prospects. Nevertheless  the need for effective global adjustments stands as the major challenge for the world economy.The new policy measures in the monetary field adopted by the major developed countries  as well as the recent decline in oil prices  can be cited as favorable developments  for energy-importing countries in particular. On the other hand  the worrying structural problems in the world economy which came to light towards the end of the 1970s for the most part still need to be resolved.The present imbalances in trade and payments are unprecedented. Rising debt burdens in the developing countries  large domestic and external imbalances in the industrial economies  high unemployment and persistent protectionism in international trade continue to burden the world economy.Most hard hit by those factors are the developing countries  whose prospects of growth and stability remain bleak in the face of acute economic problems. Since the beginning of the 1980s a number of developing countries have begun the process of applying difficult structural adjustment policies to promote growth  employment and the integration of their domestic economies into the world economy. However  those efforts alone are not sufficient to produce the desired results while the external economic environment continues to exert a negative influence.The practice of protectionism by the industrialized countries has been a matter of serious concern for the developing nations. It is evident that the successful implementation of growth-oriented adjustment policies  and progress towards the solution of the debt problem depend crucially on the ability of the developing countries to increase their exports.The export-oriented economic strategy we initiated in Turkey in 1980  togetherwith prudent demand management and continuous structural reform  have led to a successful performance and demonstrated Turkey's determination to implement an effective adjustment program. Thanks to these policies  we have been able to achieve growth of store than 7 per cent this year and to lower considerably the level of inflation. We have liberalized our economy and removed restrictions on imports. However  the major obstacles we have continued to encounter in these efforts have been the increasing restrictions imposed and the protectionist policies adopted by most of the industrialized countries.He have repeatedly stressed that protectionism is a major threat to the world economy. The proliferation of various types of barriers over the past few years has led to serious Questions about the free trade system. Considering the current sombre situation in international trade  the recent consensus reached by trade Ministers  meeting at Punta del Este  on launching new multilateral trade negotiations is promising. The guidelines for the new round of talks offer the hope of speeding up the process of trade liberalization  we consider as very encouraging commitments to tackle problems in the areas of agriculture  textiles and clothing  to halt all protective measures and to phase out restrictions. We are confident that in determining new trade patterns in those sectors more emphasis will be given to the operation of comparative advantages.In our view  under the present circumstances  the system of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) remains the most appropriate framework to cope with the severe bottlenecks in world trade. In that respect  our primary task in the upcoming negotiations should be to restore the credibility and authority of GATT in order to open up the main centers of world markets to the goods of both developing and developed countries. We hope these negotiations will help develop a more open  viable and durable multilateral trading system which will promote growth and stability in the world economy.This year  in May  the international community united its efforts in a demonstration of concerted international co-operation in response to the urgent and critical economic situation that confronts the African continent. For the first time a special session of the General Assembly was devoted to the critical economic situation of one region of the world. The adoption by consensus at that special session of the United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  1986-1990  can be viewed as a tangible and important indication about the future of international co-operation in the context of the United Nations.We shall continue to implement the assistance program we have initiated for the countries of the Sahel and to contribute to the efforts of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. The framework outlined in the United Nations program of Action will guide our efforts in this field.I wish to comment briefly on the financial crisis in which the United Nations finds itself. It is unfortunate that the United Nations has had to face such a severe financial crisis in its fortieth year. It is clear that the prolongation of the crisis holds the danger of impairing the work of the Organization in many areas. This is certainly one of the most urgent and important matters to be addressed by the General Assembly at this session. We appreciate the work of the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts which was charged with the task of reviewing the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the Organization. The recommendations found in the Group's report need careful consideration  but it may be confidently said that many of the recommendations are sensible  reasonable and measured.In conclusion  I wish and hope that the deliberations of the General Assembly at its forty-first session will be fruitful and will contribute to peace and to the welfare of the world community."
"136",7053,"TZA",41,1986," Allow me first  Sir  to congratulate you on your well-deserved election as President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that  as was the case during the fourteenth special session of this body  you and your colleagues on the General Committee will guide our deliberations during this session of the Assembly to a successful conclusion.We are also delighted to see the Secretary-General back at the helm of our Organization in better health and ready to guide the multifaceted work of the Organization. We wish him continued good health  particularly at this time when our Organization is undergoing an acute political and financial crisis such as it has not experienced since its inception 41 years ago.Last year we commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  and all Member States - big and small  rich and poor - reaffirmed their support for a stronger and better United Nations based on sovereign equality  mutual respect  human dignity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. Many leaders also expressed their concern at the escalation of the arms race  the increasing number of regional conflicts  the increasing use of threats by some Powers throughout the united Nations system  the deterioration of the world economic situation  the advance of an anti-internationalist climate and attacks on multilateralism in international economic relations  the problem of rapidly mounting debts and inequity in the international monetary system  the violation of basic human rights and the continued existence of colonialism  oppression and exploitation  to mention only a few of today's problems.Regrettably  all those concerns are still valid today as they were last year. In fact  the grounds for those concerns are getting stronger every month that Passes. Indeed  there is now a very ominous cloud hanging over multilateralism  international economic co-operation and world peace and security.One of the explosive issues threatening our Organization's integrity today is the continued practice of the obnoxious policy of apartheid in South Africa  a political system which has been condemned by the international community as a crime against humanity  an affront to universal conscience  and the root cause of the political instability in southern Africa.The sufferings of the majority of black South Africans under the repressive Pretoria regime has been no less dehumanizing than its predecessor  Nazism - a system still admired and emulated by the architects of apartheid. The black people of South Africa over the years have been subjected to brutal exploitation  dehumanization  arbitrary arrests  detention  torture and killing. These oppressive policies have become much worse during the past two years as a result of the nation-wide uprisings by the black South Africans against the draconian laws of the Pretoria regime.The accession to independence by Angola and Mozambique shattered the Pretoriaregime's myth of the perpetual existence of a buffer zone between its borders and the black-ruled independent African States. The Soweto uprisings of 1976 and the national uprising of June 1984 were a clear signal to the world from the black people of South Africa of their determination to overthrow the repugnant and abhorrent apartheid regime.All those developments provided the Pretoria racist regime with an excuse to mount a sustained destabilization campaign against neighboring independent AfricanStates which has cost those countries billions of United States dollars  apart from the loss of thousands of innocent lives.Over the past two years more than 2 000 black South Africans have lost their lives at the hands of the ruthless and bloodthirsty Pretoria racist regime for the sake of their freedom  and the declaration of any number of states of emergency or siege by the regime will never stem this uprising by the majority of South Africans. Thousands will continue to die every year until apartheid is dismantled. It is now an internationally acknowledged fact that negotiations with the apartheid rlgime will not end the policy of apartheid. That has always been our belief  and it was recently reaffirmed by the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group  which unequivocally concluded that the apartheid r4gime was not ready for any internal dialog that could lead to a peaceful settlement of the political problem in South Africa. The subsequent utter failure of the British Foreign Secretary's mission to South Africa also confirmed that fact.As many representatives who have spoken before me at this session  including those from African front-line States  have exhaustively detailed the intransigence  crimes and sins of the South African apartheid regime - which have also been very adequately covered by both the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  President Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Congo  and the current Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement  Prime Minister Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe - and in the interest of economy  my delegation will not repeat what has already been very competently presented during this general debate. This is the more necessary ii view of the fact that my Government participated fully in the recent International Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  the subsequent Vienna International Conference on the Immediate Independence of Namibia  the most recentSummit of the Organization of African unity  the Eighth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Harare last month  and the fourteenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the question of Namibia which preceded this general debate  at all of which the question of the apartheid  racist regime of South Africa featured very prominently. However  in lieu of that  my delegation would like to reaffirm once more its firm and continued support for all past resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly  the Organization of African unity  the Non-Aligned Movement  and all the international conferences and seminars recently held on the racist regime of South Africa which form a very adequate basis for concerted international action against the South African apartheid regime.I come now to what form this concerted international peaceful action against the apartheid regime of South Africa should take. Very briefly  from the resolutions and recommendations of the Organization of African Uhity  the recent Harare Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement  the Paris International Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa and other recent relevant international seminars  my delegation very strongly believes that the early imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter is the only effective peaceful and concerted action left for the international community to take. It is the sincere hope of my delegation that the United Nations Security Council will  in the near future  take a decision to this end  given the recent and growing world-wide demands for sanctions against racist South Africa.As the liberation struggle will have to continue in South Africa even after sanctions have been applied against the apartheid regime of South Africa  wo very strongly appeal to all United Nations States Members  individually and collectively to increase their moral  political  diplomatic and material support to the national liberation movements of southern Africa. Equally important  we appeal to the international community as a whole to increase significantly its moral  economic  diplomatic and military support to the front-line States and to the member States of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) which are already suffering from the destabilizing effects of the Pretoria regime.It was only three weeks ago that our Foreign Minister addressed the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the question of Namibia and  obviously  my Government's views could not have changed within such a short period. However  in view of the importance that we place on the independence of Namibia  I shall briefly reiterate some of the points our Foreign Minister made at that special session.For 20 years new the South African apartheid regime has continued to occupy the Territory of Namibia illegally and in defiance of all relevant United Nations resolutions  including Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The apartheid regime was recently encouraged in this defiance and intransigence by the policy of so-called constructive engagement of the present Administration of the United States of America  the linking of Namibia's independence to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola  and the overt provision of arms and Stinger missiles to the criminal Savimbi bandits fighting the legitimate Government of Angola. Those actions by the Administration of the United States of America have rightly been condemned by the OAU Summit  the recent Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Harare  the International Conference on the Immediate Independence of Namibia and other recent international seminars and forums. Here  my delegation would like toreaffirm the right of the Government of Angola to retain Cuban troops on its soilas long as it continues to be threatened by the presence of troops of the apartheidregime  in both Angola and Namibia.The situation in Namibia has been deteriorating day after day and  as ourForeign Minister stated at the special session on the question of Namibia:""The racist regime  not being sure of its own very survival in South Africa is trying to cling on to Namibia either to use it ultimately as a bufferagainst what it alleges to be an onslaught from its neighboring ... AfricanStates  or  at the appropriate time  to use Namibia in its bargaining andnegotiating scheme for the perpetuation of apartheid in southern Africa.But even in Namibia - a Territory which  legally speaking  is still under the mandate of the United Nations - the obnoxious policy of apartheid is being applied by the South African regime through its puppet Multi-Party Conference. There is thus an urgent need for the United Nations to act very quickly to end South Africa's 20 years of procrastination before it is too late.Foremost among the actions that should be taken by the United Nations is the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  without any delay or pre-conditions. In that connection we reiterate our sympathy with the Secretary-General who  in his attempts to bring about the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  has encountered many obstructions and set-backs deliberately effected with the collaboration of South Africa's ""allies"" and supporters. We reaffirm our confidence in and support for the Secretary-General in his endeavors to implement without delay Security Council resolution 435 (1978) for the independence of Namibia.But as the defiance and intransigence of the South African regime is not likely to end quickly  the Security Council should be requested to impose comprehensive mandatory sanctions against racist South Africa under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  to complement measures that have already been taken by Governments  organizations  the public  and individuals in various countries. All those measures are necessary to isolate the apartheid regime and force it to accept a settlement of the question of Namibia and peaceful change in South Africa itself in the interest of all its inhabitants.In that connection we reiterate our appreciation of the measures already taken by a number of Western Governments to isolate South Africa and force that country's Government to dismantle apartheid. We also note with appreciation the efforts of a growing number of non-governmental organizations  universities and individuals toexert pressure on their respective Governments to reduce their opposition to the imposition of mandatory sanctions against South Africa. In this regard  we very sincerely thank the people of the united States  who through their representatives in the United States Congress were able last week to force the United States Administration to move further in the right direction.It is regrettable that the question of Western Sahara has thus far remained unresolved. We support and reaffirm the validity of the struggle of the Sahraoui people for the right of self-determination  freedom and national independence. Regrettably  one party to the conflict has stubbornly and illogically continued to obstruct the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations  which provide a constructive peace plan for ending the conflict in keeping with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960 on the self-determination of Territories under foreign domination.We have noted with satisfaction the mediation efforts being pursued by the Secretary-General of the united Nations and by the Chairman of the OAU with a view to resolving the conflict in accordance with the peace plan of the OAU and the United Nations. In this connection  we urge the parties to the conflict  and in particular Morocco  to co-operate and provide the necessary conditions that wouldsoon lead to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.Another subject of concern to my delegation is the future of the Comorian island of Mayotte. The Charter of our Organization is unequivocal about the inviolability of the territorial integrity of Member States. We thus urge the speedy conclusion of the ongoing bilateral negotiations between Prance and theComoros on the restoration of the island of Mayotte as an integral part of theThe relevant OAU and United Nations territory of the Comoros  in accordance with the relevant: OAUresolutions .The continued denial of the Palestinian people's inalienable right of self-determination  including its right to establish an independent State of its own  remains the root cause of the endless violence and instability in the Middle East. Israel's refusal to withdraw from all the Arab territories occupied since 1967  its continued aggression against its neighbors  and  in particular  the displacement  arrests  torture and killing of Palestinians and the perpetual violation of Lebanese territory will never lead to peace in the Middle East. We are of the view that a solution to the Middle East problem can lie only in the self-determination of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization. In addition  we reiterate our appeal to Israel to stop its illegal policy of establishing settlements in the occupied Arab territories. We support the early convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all parties to the conflict with a view to finding a just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem.The Iran-Iraq war  now in its seventh year  has so far taken a very heavy toll in terms of human life and property in those two non-aligned developing countries. My Government has actively supported and encouraged the various mediation efforts of the United Nations  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Organization of the Islamic Conference and other efforts by individual countries to find a solution to the conflict. In that regard  we once again urge both Iran and Iraq to heed the numerous appeals for a peaceful settlement of the conflict with a view to its early termination.The question of Cyprus continues to be of great concern to all of us. The inter-communal differences in that country  exacerbated by foreign involvement  have compounded the problem. We regret the action of the Turkish Cypriots to declare unilateral independence contrary to the spirit of the negotiations taking place in the context of the good offices of the Secretary-General  who over the years has tried his best to search for a solution to the problem. We renew once again our appeal to Turkey and to Greece to exercise restraint and help promote dialog among the Cypriot people with a view to finding durable peace in that troubled country  we commend the Secretary-General for his efforts and request him to continue his mediation efforts until a satisfactory solution is found.The situation in Central America  in our view  has taken a dangerous turn. The threat and use of force against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Nicaragua continue unabated. The outside interference in the internal affairs of Nicaragua aimed at overthrowing the legitimate Government of that country has further compounded the problem. We urge the United States Administration to respect the recent judgment of the International Court of Justice on this issue  in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We also call on the parties concerned to support the Contadora process  which provides a viable formula for the restoration of peace and security in the region.As regards the problem of the Korean peninsula  we support the efforts of the Korean people to achieve the reunification of their country by peaceful means. We therefore urge the two parts of Korea to continue to engage in a constructive dialog that can lead to a just and lasting solution. In addition  we appeal for the speedy removal from the peninsula of all foreign troops  the continued presence of which would be prejudicial to the success of that dialog. However  Tanzania will never support the separate admission of the two Koreas to membership of the United Nations.In Afghanistan  we support all efforts that could lead to a peaceful solution to the problem. We remain convinced that it is high time a solution was found so as to end the suffering of innocent people  hundreds of thousands of whom have been fleeing their mother country as refugees. In this regard  we again commend the mediation efforts of the Secretary-General and urge all the parties concerned to continue to give him all the co-operation he needs. Finally  Tanzania reaffirms the principle of respect for the territorial integrity of Afghanistan  from which foreign troops should be withdrawn without further delay.Concerning Kampuchea  my delegation is concerned that for eight years in succession the General Assembly has discussed this issue  which is still a source of conflict in South-East Asia. We strongly urge all the parties concerned to do their level best to contribute to the speedy implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions on Kampuchea in the interest of peace and stability in the South-East Asian and Pacific regions and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. My delegation  however  reserves the right to revert to this issue when the item entitled ""The situation in Kampuchea"" comes up for consideration in the plenary meeting at this session.On the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas)  my delegation urges thetwo parties to the dispute to resume negotiations soon in order to find a peacefulsolution to the sovereignty issue in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions.We reiterate that Tanzania  like many other developed and developing countries  deeply regrets that the arms race continues  while millions of people are starving and undernourished. We are opposed to the arms race  whose effects are devastating. We have noted  however  with satisfaction the resumption of the arms reduction talks between the United States and the Soviet Union. We are also encouraged by the recent decision of General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan to hold another round of discussions aimed at limiting the conventional  strategic and nuclear arms race and halting nuclear-weapon testing. We commend the Soviet Union's continued unilateral moratorium and call upon the United States to take similar action so as to create the conditions for a comprehensive test ban treaty and an eventual nuclear arms reduction and nuclear freeze.We also remain convinced that peace and security are the prerogative of every State  for nuclear war threatens their survival. Thus we all have the right to demand cessation of the development of all nuclear weapons.My country  which is. one of the participants in the five-continent peace initiative  reiterates the importance of confidence-building measures between the super-Powers and the creation of an atmosphere favorable to the application of verification measures as a necessary prerequisite for a comprehensive test ban treaty. These measures are necessary if the nuclearization of outer space is to be avoided  We earnestly appeal to the super-Powers to take the steps necessary to lead to the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons and the release of the resourcesnow used for developing them to be used for peaceful purposes  including the development of the developing countries.The world economic environment remains hostile for most of the developing countries  particularly the least developed countries  26 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. The result has been a serious setback to development in most developing countries caused by the poor growth performance of the developed market economy countries during the 1980s. Although the recent fall in interest rates has resulted in savings to developing countries of about $US 13 billion on debt servicing  those countries lost over $US 50 billion in 1985 through deterioration in their terms of trade  deceleration of export volume growth and the drop in earnings on official reserves. The sharp decrease in the flow of new bank lending and official development assistance to developing countries has caused their plight to worsen further and many of them have experienced negative economic growth  with the attendant lowering of the standard of living of their populations. In the case of sub-Saharan Africa  the problem has been compounded by the recent drought and famine  and other man—made and natural disasters. The existing heavy debt service burden on African and other developing countries  has thus to be viewed in this context.Where do we go from here? It is obvious to my delegation that until the international community indeed recognizes the economic interdependence of developed and developing countries  until the international community fully recognizes that developing countries will be unable to pay their debts unless sufficient resources are available to them for growth and development from the international banking system  international multilateral financial institutions and official sources -that is  official development assistance  until the international community puts in place for developing countries adjustment conditions that promote growth anddevelopment  and until developing countries cease being net exporters of capital to developed countries  growth and development in developing countries will not be feasible and the debt crisis will remain a time bomb threatening the international community indefinitely.Thus  as long as the inequitable terms of trade  protectionism  high interest rates and lack of sufficient resources for growth and development in developing countries continue  the global economic environment will remain hostile to developing countries. It is against this background that my delegation is expressing its profound satisfaction at the fact that the General Assembly finally agreed to include in the agenda for this session the item entitled ""Launching of global negotiations""  which first appeared on its agenda at the thirty-fourth session  in 1979. As global negotiations involve the open and thorough discussion of the interrelated problems of money  finance  debt  trade and developments in the world economy  my delegation firmly believes that the inclusion of this item in this year's agenda is a logical follow-up to General Assembly resolutions 3201 (s-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) and its Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  of May 1974. Had the General Assembly decided to exclude this agenda item it would  in fact  have taken a retrograde step which would have openly allowed the law of the jungle on the international economic scene. This would have been the death knell of international economic co-operation for development  with all its frightening consequences.Let me now turn to the recent thirteenth special session of the General Assembly  on the critical economic situation in Africa. The special session on Africa was a special event in African economic history  and the adoption by consensus of the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recoveryand Development 1986-1990 was indeed an encouragement to the African people. My delegation would like to reiterate its gratitude to all Governments international and non-governmental organizations that contributed to its success. It is our sincere hope that they will also participate actively in the implementation of the Program.At the special session  African nations clearly elaborated their economic problems and suggested solutions to those problems. The international community has been adequately sensitized to the urgent African needs  and Africa now awaits assistance from the international community to complement its own efforts. There have been questions about whether the special session of the General Assembly on Africa was a success or a failure. The adoption of a consensus resolution on the critical economic situation in Africa was  in itself  a positive and significant outcome of the special session. However  the realization of the success of the special session is yet to be seen  since it all depends upon how the international community as a whole will implement the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. Thus  Africa is awaiting the timely response of the international community concerning the resources needed to complement its own efforts in its economic recovery Program. In view of that  we warmly welcome the Secretary-General's recent decision to establish a United Nations Steering Committee on the implementation of the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. The establishment of that Steering Committee to co-ordinate action in the United Nations system in the implementation of the Program should enjoy support by the whole international community.Before concluding my remarks on the African economic situation  I should like to remind Member States that 26 of the 37 least developed countries are in Africa. The effective implementaiton of the New Substantial Program of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1980s  approved' by consensus by the international community in Paris in 1981  thus has special importance for Africa. Quite often  that fact is forgotten by the international community when difficult economic adjustment conditions are thrust upon many sub-Saharan African countries that are least developed. My delegation very sincerely hopes that that fact will be borne in mind in the implementation of the African Priority Program for Economic Recovery  1986-1990.Just a brief word on the question of refugees: my country  like many other African countries  has in the recent past received thousands of refugees fromneighboring States. Tanzania is a signatory to the 1967 Protocol to the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and has  over the years  in spite of its poor economy  extended hospitality to refugees and continues to do so. we thus attach great importance to the well-being of refugees in general  and that is why we recently granted Tanzanian citizenship to over 30 000 refugees in Tanzania. However  in addition to the support promised to African countries at both the first and the second international Conferences on Assistance to Refugees in Africa  we urge the international community to reach an early satisfactory decision on the burning question of military attacks on refugee camps  which has remained pending for over three years now. My delegation will be addressing this issue again in the relevant main Committee at the current session of the Assembly.Over the past few years the united Nations has been going through an acute financial crisis  mainly as a result of the withholding of assessed contributions by some Member States. The motivation behind that non-payment of assessed contributions by many of the more affluent Member States is political  and its solution is  of necessity  political. While my delegation warmly welcomes the various measures recommended by both the former Presidents of the General Assembly and the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee aimed at the rationalization of the efficiency of General Assembly sessions  we urge that those recommendations should new be formally considered by the General Assembly at this session instead of being informally recommended by the management for use during this session of the General Assembly without any legal authority. My delegation will be ready to participate positively in that exercise  particularly when the relevant agenda item comes up later on in the Assembly.Finally  I should like to comment briefly on the report of the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations. My delegation congratulates theGroup of 18 for managing to submit a report to this session of the General Assembly  given the time constraints under which the Group had to work. Since the bulk of the Group's recommendations are not specific  my delegation trusts that enough time will be allotted for a thorough examination of the report by the General Assembly in plenary and in the Fifth Committee so that in accepting any of the recommendations Member States will know exactly what they are accepting. I should emphasize that  although fully in favor of reform  Tanzania strongly believes that measures for reform must not be imposed on the United Nations and that proposals for reform must be discussed thoroughly and that agreement must not be reached under duress. My delegation notes that  contrary to the impression now being created  there was no consensus or evident agreement in the Group of 18 on matters related to the vital subject of planning  programming and budgeting in the United Nations. My delegation will give its views on that important subject when the Group's report is examined in detail. Meanwhile  I should like to state that Tanzania will very strongly oppose any proposals to establish mechanisms  no matter what they are called  that will infringe the principle of the sovereign equality of Member States under the United Nations Charter  alter the power and prerogatives of the main organs of the United Nations and impair the prerogatives of the Secretary-General as chief administrative officer of the Organization."
"137",7143,"UKR",41,1986," The United Nations has entered its fifth decade at an extremely troubled time  when mankind is faced with a historic choice - either to accept the inexorable drift to nuclear self-annihilation or to avert the catastrophe through our combined efforts before it is too late and to choose the path leading to a lasting and guaranteed peace.The refinement of nuclear weapons and the desire to extend the arms race to outer space through the implementation of the adventuristic ""star wars"" program being stubbornly pursued by aggressive imperialist circles  first and foremost by the United States  increase the danger of war many times over and pose a genuine threat to destroy civilization a».-<3 life on Earth.The world has reached a point where it is imperative fully to realize the disastrous nature of the course of a further build-up of armaments. Governments must demonstrate a heightened sense of responsibility for- the fate of mankind.The authors of the Mexico Declaration were perfectly right to state that saving the world from war by building up ever greater arms arsenals is as impossible as trying to cure a drug addict by giving him ever greater doses of drugs.The most important of all problems - that of survival - can be resolved only by making a fundamental about-turn towards a truly safe world. It cannot be resolved by way of militarization  by undermining the security of others or by setting international security against national or regional security. In the modern nuclear and space age  no State  however powerful  can ensure its own security through military and technical means alone.Genuine security can only be universal  mutual and equal for all. To that end  it is essential to rise above narrow national interests and differences in ideology or world outlook. This can only be a move through combined efforts and through broad and constructive co-operation by ail States irrespective of their political or social systems. Such were the incontrovertible conclusions reached by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at its twenty-seventh Congress. The foreign policy program adopted by the Congress represents i. fusion of new political thinking with a platform of concrete actions aimed at improving the international situation  eliminating the threat of nuclear war and creating a comprehensive system of security in the world.The socialist States  including the Ukrainian SSR  have submitted for consideration at this session of the General Assembly an item entitled ""Establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security"".There was some speculation that this collective proposal by the socialist countries was a mere repetition of the provisions of the United Nations Charter and of other documents previously adopted at the United Nations. Peace and international security are  indeed  the primary goal that this Organization is called upon to pursue. However  the truth and higher meaning of our proposal is the idea that while proclaiming peace and security  we should initiate specific effective actions towards their practical implementation. We believe that our proposal is extremely timely. It is dictated by the imperative need to take immediate and urgent measures to prevent nuclear catastrophe. The socialist countries are ready to co-operate actively with all States to achieve that goal.We are convinced that the time has come to adopt a new approach to the problem of universal security and to bring both actions and political thinking into line with the realities of the nuclear and space age. In his speech in Vladivostok on 28 July of this year  the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet union  Mikhail Gorbachev  emphasized that""the present generations have inherited numerous difficult and painful problems. In order to advance towards solving those problems it is necessary to jettison the dead weight of the past and to seek new approaches  guided by a sense of responsibility to the present and to the future.... It)day more than every before  it is important to mobilize the potential of common sense that exists in the world and the partnership of reason to stop the drift towards disaster.The United Nations must do its utmost to ensure that the peoples of the world enter the third millennium  as truly united nations. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR calls on all States Members of the United Nations to join actively in the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security and to mark the International Year of Peace by taking vigorous action in this area.The comprehensive system of international peace and security that we propose would encompass the military  political  economic and humanitarian fields. It presupposes unconditional renunciation of war  both nuclear and conventional  and of the use or threat of the use of force as a means to resolve political  economic  ideological or other disputes between States.It was with great satisfaction that we welcomed the agreement on a meeting between the leaders of the USSR and the United States of America - the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Sergeiyevich Gorbachev  and the President of the United States of America  Ronald Reagan - at Reykjavik  Iceland  on 11 and 12 October this year. All those who cherish world peace and tranquility expect that meeting to yield concrete results that will serve to improve Soviet-United States relations and the international situation as a whole.It is important for people everywhere in the world to realize that the buildup and refinement of nuclear and conventional arsenals and attempts to extend the arms race to outer space cannot strengthen the security of anyone  but will rather lead directly to the destruction of civilization.The misfortune we experienced last April - the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power-plant  where only a small portion of the accumulated nuclear power went out of control - served as one more grin warning of the unforeseeable dangers inherent in the nuclear age. This calls for a great sense of responsibility and a new approach to the scientific  technological and political realities of today's world.The accident resulted in loss of life and caused enormous material and moral damage. All the necessary resources and the scientific and technical potential of the entire soviet Onion were mobilized to deal with its consequences. That enabled us within a short space of time to limit the scope of the accident and to minimize its severe consequences.The lessons of Chernobyl compel all of us to treat the problem of nuclear safety with the utmost seriousness and responsibility. We welcome and support the measures and action taken in this respect by the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA). But security becomes meaningless if the main danger is not eliminated: the possibility of the deliberate  intentional use of the catastrophically destructive power of the atom for nuclear purposes. What happened at Chernobyl is but a pale shadow of the threat posed by thermonuclear weapons. Nuclear safety on earth is inconceivable without a cessation of the concrete preparations for nuclear war and without the total elimination of the means of waging nuclear war.To that end  the countries of the socialist community have undertaken a number of major principled foreign policy actions. Here  the program proposed by the Soviet Union for the total elimination of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction everywhere before the end of the century constitutes a real milestone. The noble purpose of that program is to remove the nuclear threat without shifting the burden of resolving this key issue onto the shoulders of our children.But the prospect of overcoming the negative  confrontational tendencies which have been on the rise in recent years is not to the liking of certain quarters in the West. The military machine of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance  far from showing any signs of slowing down  is actually accelerating in all areas of the arms build-up. The ""star wars"" program is going full speed ahead. The creation and development of newer and newer systems of weapons for strategic offense is being stepped up. In order to clear the way for those weapons  existing treaty constraints are being brushed aside without hesitation. That is particularly obvious from Washington's attitude towards the second Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (SALT II). The newest United States missiles have readied the Treaty ceilings  aid that is why the United States is renouncing both SALT I and SALT II. That kind of political ""logic"" opens the floodgates for an uncontrolled arms race.The General Assembly is duty-bound to take a stand of principle cm those actions and to affirm unambiguously the importance of preserving and expanding the existing system of agreements in the field of arms limitation and disarmament. The outcome of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe is compelling proof that  given the political will and the desire  it is possible and feasible to conclude military and political agreements between States with differing social systems. That is an example of hew detente can and must be restored and how a new  stable structure of international relations can be organized.There are political decisions that play a decisive role by giving rise to new tendencies which open entirely new ways for the development of the international situation. The Soviet Union's decision concerning the moratorium on nuclear tests is undoubtedly one of these. The Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear tests  which has been in force for ewer a year now  is a practical example of a foreign policy of peace and international security. We favor not merely the cessation of tests  but a treaty-con trolled ban on nuclear testing; of all steps toward arms limitation now feasible  such a ban would be the roost rapid and most radical. The cessation of tests wouM in fact halt the arms race in its mostdangerous area the development and improvement t of new types of nuclear weapons. Al' that would remain would be to deal with the quantitative arms race  which seems to be a less difficult task.The cessation of nuclear tests could lead to a radical change in the public and political climate in the world  md could do so more effectively than any one-time measures. An atmosphere of greater confidence among States would be created  which would be of paramount importance for the resolution of other outstanding problems and conflicts  particularly since compliance with an agreement banning nuclear tests can be guaranteed by absolutely reliable means of verification and monitoring. Today even the smallest nuclear explosion can be detected.The most convincing indication of how seriously each of the nuclear Powers views the question of disarmament  international security and fee cause of peace as a whole is their respective attitudes towards halting nuclear tests and towards the early formulation of a treaty banning them completely.The United States of America categorically opposes the cessation of nuclear tests. Since the introduction of the Soviet moratorium it has set off 21 explosions. Three additional tests - the Bonneville  Budy and Belmont tests - are scheduled for October  and in December the United States intends to carry out a nuclear test code-named ""Middle Note"". What is the purpose of all this? The answer is clear: the development of a nuclear-pumped laser for the notorious system of the strategic defense initiative requires about 100 nuclear explosions.The refusal of the United States to stop nuclear-weapon tests despite the resolute demands of the world public convincingly refutes the Administration's assurances that the United States is seeking to save mankind from nuclear weapons.which is one of the arguments it also uses in its attempt to justify the implementation of the so-called strategic defense initiative  which is actually aimed at the acquisition of a nuclear first-strike capability.The time has coroe to make use of all existing leverage and possibilities  including the tremendous potential of the United Nations  to prevent the introduction of weapons to outer space. A basis for finding a mutually acceptable solution to the problem of preventing an arms race in space exists. The USSR favors a ban on the development  testing and deployment of space strike arms  under effective verification  and it has proposed that important partial steps be taken in that direction  such as agreement not to withdraw during the coming 15 years from the anti-ballistic missile Treaty  the conclusion of an international agreement on the immunity of artificial Earth satellites  agreement not to develop new anti-satellite systems  and the elimination of existing anti-satellite systems. Specific ideas on the subject have been presented both at the bilateral Soviet-United States negotiations and at the Conference on Disarmament.In response to the appeal by the General Assembly  the Soviet Union proposed in a letter of 12 June 1986 addressed to the United Nations Secretary-General that immediate action be taken to achieve a twofold objectives to stop the preparations for ""star wars""  which would lead to nuclear suicide  and adopt instead the alternative of exploring outer space through the joint efforts of States for the benefit of mankind. Questions pertaining to the practical implementation of that initiative should be considered at a special international conference and resolved by an international agency to be established for that purpose. In that case appropriations running into trillions of dollars would be put to proper use. We urge the current session to make an important contribution to preventing an arms race in outer space and establishing equitable co-operation in the peaceful exploration of outer space.The cause of saving mankind from the threat of nuclear war would be significantly served by resolving such urgent problems as the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in all parts of the world. Specific proposals made by socialist  non-aligned and neutral countries on these subjects are well known.The socialist States believe in a comprehensive approach to the disarmament problem and ensuring that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction is backed up by significant reductions in armed forces and conventional armaments. This Question is becoming a matter of increasing urgoncy for the present and future of the European continent.Ways of resolving this problem can be found in the large-scale program for reducing armed forces and conventional armaments from the Atlantic to the Urals  put forward in Budapest last June by the Warsaw Treaty member States. Those proposals take into account the position of Western European States which believe that nuclear disarmament in Europe should go hand in hand with reduction of conventional armaments.Making the world safe is inconceivable without chemical disarmament. The Ukrainian SSR takes a favorable view of the efforts of the Conference on Disarmament to work out an international convention on the subject. It is to be hoped that the convention will be completed by 1987. We support proposals co-establishing chemical-weapon-free zones in Central Europe and the Balkans  which is the objective of the well-known initiatives of the German Democratic Republic  Czechoslovakia  Bulgaria and Romania.It is imperative for the General Assembly to call upon all States to refrain from any action which could impede negotiations on banning chemical weapons.A substantial contribution to curbing the arms race and to disarmament would be made by implementing the proposals of the socialist countries on the mutual non-increase in military spending  non-use of armed force  and the maintenance of peaceful relations between Warsaw Treaty member States and the countries members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).The countries of the socialist community attach great importance to holding in 1987 an international conference on the relationship between disarmament and development. It is to be regretted that such a conference could not be held this year. The militaristic principle of armaments instead of development should be replaced by the normal state of affairs - disarmament for development. In the current difficult and dangerous situation in the world all the resources of the United Nations should be mobilized to take specific action to defuse conflict situations and settle contentious issues by political means through collective efforts  with unconditional respect for the independence and the right of peoples to determine their own destiny.Tensions still exist in the Middle Bast  created by the aggressive designs of Israel and the anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian policies of its protectors. Recent events have amply demonstrated the untenable nature of separatist and defeatist deals towards which the Arabs are being nudged by the United States and Israel.A just settlement in the area can be achieved only through joint efforts  with equal participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations support the idea of convening an international conference on the Middle East. An appropriate preparatory committee within the framework of the Security Council could immediately start work on preparing for such a conference.We must also note a further exacerbation of the situation in the Mediterranean as a result of militaristic actions designed to implement the doctrine of ""neo-globalism"". It was manifested in acts of aggression against sovereign Libya  which provoked protests and indignation throughout the world  in the blackmail campaign against Syria  and in the continuing aggression against Lebanon.The Ukrainian SSR strongly advocates turning the Mediterranean from an area of military and political confrontation into a zone of stable peace and security  and supports the steps that are being taken by peace-loving States to improve the situation in the region.We want to see a just solution to the Cyprus Question  on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions  without outside interference and with due regard for the legitimate interests of the two communities. We believe that the convening of a representative international conference is a realistic means of achieving that goal. Holding such a conference would help to resolve such aspects of the problem as the establishment of a system of effective international guarantees  withdrawal of foreign troops  and the elimination of all foreign military bases and facilities.In the guise of hypocritical arguments about ""freedom""  ""democracy"" and ""humanism""  a policy of State-sponsored terrorism is being pursued against the countries and peoples of Central America  and the material base is being expanded for unleashing a major armed conflict in the area. Subversive activities by the United States have particularly increased in recent times when there have appeared hopes for success in the Contadora process.The Ukrainian SSR expresses its total solidarity with the just struggle of the Nicaraguan people to defend the independence of their country and strongly condemns the escalation of aggressive actions against Nicaragua. The resolution of the crisis in Central America is possible only within the framework of a peaceful political settlement and on the basis of generally recognized rules of international law. The Ukrainian SSR supports the proposal by Nicaragua to turn Central America into a zone of peace and co-operation  free from foreign military presence.The representative international conferences held this year have more than ever before focused attention on the need for an immediate political settlement in southern Africa. The racist Pretoria regime is defying the whole world by stepping up repression of the civilian population  refusing to grant independence to Namibia  which it occupies  and committing acts of aggression against its African neighbors. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR shares the conclusion reached at the non-aligned summit at Harare that it is only through the most resolute action  including the imposition of mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  that it is possible to eliminate the shameful system of apartheid and iiqplement United Nations decisions concerning independence for Namibia and the establishment of peace and stability in the interests of the peoples of the region. The forty-first session of the United Nation General Assembly shouldbecome a new phase in mobilizing the efforts of the world community in the struggle for the speedy elimination of apartheid.Serious concern has been caused by United States actions aimed at annexing the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands - Micronesia - and turning it into one of its military and political strongholds in the Pacific Ocean. By depriving the Micronesian people of their right to genuine freedom and independence  the administering Power has grossly abused the mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council and failed to meet the objectives of trusteeship. He strongly support the demand by non-aligned countries for the immediate implementation of the Declaration on decolonization in the case of Micronesia.The Ukrainian SSR supports the realistic proposals of Viet Nam  Laos  and Kampuchea for the establishment of a zone of peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia. We support the peace efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to secure the withdrawal of United States troops from South Korea  the development of peaceful dialog between the two parts of the country  and the turning of the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone of peace.Of great importance in improving the international situation is the program for security and peaceful co-operation in the Asian and Pacific region proposed by the Soviet Union last July. By creating favorable conditions for the solution of a whole range of problems  including the problem of a political settlement of the situation around Afghanistan  that program is a manifestation of good will and a responsible approach to dealing with the main problems of today.The series of measures set forth in that program  including the prevention of the proliferation and build-up of nuclear weapons  the reduction of naval activities and cuts in armed forces and conventional weapons  not only constitutes a basis for regional security in Asia and the Pacific but can also become an integral part of the global system of security for all.The normalization of international economic relations has become a truly urgent task. The plight of developing nations and the neo-colonialist exploitation of their natural and human resources are fundamental and root causes of the political tensions and conflicts in various parts of the world.Imperialist Powers  taking advantage of the predicament of the developing countries and their huge foreign debt  interfere high-handedly in the internal affairs of countries and block the process of their economic liberation. In these circumstances the struggle for international economic security as an integral part of a comprehensive system of international security has come to the fore.The Ukrainian SSR takes an active part in United Nations efforts to encourage and promote basic freedoms and human rights and conscientiously fulfills its obligations under relevant international agreements. We cannot at the same time fail to note the hypocrisy of some Governments  prepared to pay endless lip-service to the sanctity of the rights of the individual while shamelessly violating the rights of entire peoples in the Middle East  in southern Africa  in Central America and in Asia. To that end  they are resorting to undeclared wars  subversive acts acts of State-sponsored terrorism  slanderous propaganda campaigns  economic pressure and blade mail.In order to increase the effectiveness of the work of protecting the peoples of the world from outside encroachments  the General Assembly should  we believe  begin to work on the concept of the rights of peoples  which constitute the basis for implementing human rights.The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR has outlined its approaches to the solution of urgent international problems in the sincere hope that progress can be achieved  even at this current session  in defusing some of the existing conflicts. In view of the world situation the wcrk of the United Nations General Assembly must be conducted in a constructive spirit and the businesslike deliberations at this session should contribute to overcoming the barriers of enmity and mistrust and promote the improvement of the international climate.In the words of Vladimir Shcherbitsky  member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine.""In a nuclear age there is simply no reasonable alternative to peaceful coexistence.""While calling upon representatives of other States to treat our initiatives with the utmost seriousness  we  for our part  are prepared to lend our support to any proposals that would contribute to the strengthening of peace and the development of international co-operation. The experience of the United Nations in its work of more than 40 years has shown that what is needed to improve the international situation is the combined efforts of States  tolerance and a willingness to adopt compromise decisions. In a nuclear age  mankind can survive only together  moving forward step by step from today's over-armed and exceedingly dangerous world towards a minimally armed and safe world of the twenty-first century. We can take the first step along that road here and now  at the forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly."
"138",7189,"URY",41,1986,"My delegation is especially pleased at the election of Mr. Choudhury to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. His wisdom  objectivity and diplomatic skill are a sure guarantee of the effectiveness of our work. He may be assured that he will have our broadest co-operation.I should also like to pay a tribute here to our dear friend. Ambassador Jaime de Pinies  for the work he accomplished during his presidency of the previous session  with which he brought to a climax a long and distinguished career in the United Nations.X am also particularly pleased to extend my greetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and express our satisfaction on seeing him restored to health  and I wish to express my Government's* acknowledgment of the invaluable services he is rendering to the international community and to this Organization  giving evidence always of his selflessness and creative intelligence  inspired at all times by a genuine international feeling. It is our hope  and the desire of my Government  that for a long time to come the United Nations will continue to benefit from the competence  prudence and patience that characterize his performance in office  which are especially necessary in the difficult times that lie ahead.One year ago  the General Assembly proclaimed 1986 to be the International Year of Peace and called upon all the peoples of the world to join with the United Nations in resolute efforts to safeguard peace and the future of mankind through continuous and positive action on the part of States and peoples  with the aim of preventing war through removal of various threats to peace  the resolution of conflicts by peaceful means and the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms  as stated in the preamble to the Charter.It was  therefore  a tragic irony that during the first weeks of the Year of Peace  Olaf Palme  without any doubt one of the most fervent and generous fighters for peace in this century  should fall victim to the darkest and most cowardly form of violence  in Sweden  his native land  a country which can be justly proud of a tradition of peace which few countries can match. The death of this admirable and exemplary worker for peace was an omen marking the beginning of a year which mankind was to have devoted to the preservation and realization of the right of peoples to peace.In this Year of Peace  the chronic evils which beset the world seem to have reached a degree unknown in previous years. The more Utopian the final objectives  the greater the threat to the objectives of peace. Violence is manifest in all its dismal forms: from open wars to the most vicious acts of terrorism. The quantitative and qualitative development of the war industry continues at the fast pace imposed by an increasing and ever more diversified demand. In the meantime  vast sectors of mankind fall victim to the scourge of hunger  disease or ignorance  or continue to be subject to the rules of racist minorities.Thus peace  understood not only as the absence of war  but as the ""serenity in order"" of which St. Augustine spoke and which is reflected in a state of affairs in which security  justice and prosperity prevail  has been conspicuously absent in this International Year of Peace.We must therefore ask ourselves what is keeping us from victory in this struggle in which we all seem to be on the same side. Why is there such a gulf between what we all advocate and what happens outside the United Nations? It is commonplace to ascribe the responsibility to the lack of political will on the part of the major protagonists of power. But perhaps part of the answer must be south in the revolutionary impact which the development of modern technology is having onsociety. The tide of technology in which we are submerged is causing profound changes in both our individual and collective way of living  in our way of thinking and feeling  and in the perception of our goals and hopes. It is this technology that confers on any armed conflict  no matter how localized it may be  the potential apocalyptic effects. The possibility of annihilating entire populations underlies any warlike confrontation: it is a possibility that can rapidly become a reality if a propitious time is provided by the escalation of a conflict  which is generally inevitable. Let us not forget that the death and suffering of innocent victims  who day after day are unwillingly trapped in the present conflicts  are a harsh fact of contemporary life  which we cannot be used to despite its almost daily occurrence in the cities and towns of Iraq  Iran  Lebanon  Afghanistan or Kampuchea.It is the technological factor that gives a new dimension to an old phenomenon  terrorism  which has not ceased to manifest itself since the beginning of the nineteenth century  and which has become worse during the last few years  thanks to the increasing sophistication of the methods used  as well as the characteristics of modern life in open and democratic societies that increase the chances of attack  increase the exposure of the victims  and favor the cowardly anonymity of the attackers.We have met here at this time to ask ourselves what is the proper way to respond with our international institutions to the challenges to our international relations posed by the formidable technological explosion which characterizes these last years of this twentieth century.How can we face these challenges of today's reality? How can we overcome the obstacles that have prevented us  not just from achieving the ideal of peace  but from even costing most to it? what should we do to see that at future sessions of this Assembly  we do not just talk about the past but rather talk about positive achievements?We sincerely believe that the present has come to undertake a serious consideration not only of the rules that govern our international conduct but also of the political  legal and institutional instruments that we can use to obtain our common aims.Uruguay believes that  in view of the dangerous course of international relations in recent years  we must immediately undertake a process of thorough examination and unbiased assessment of the existing legal and institutional apparatus  in order to determine how it can be adapted to fit present conditions. To that aid  we think that good starting points for that examination have been recommended by the ' group of 18. My Government will participate in the examination with the utmost enthusiasm and dedication. It must start from two premises. The first is that the principles of the San Francisco Charter must be upheld  since they express absolute values which must continue to guide our international conduct. The second is that the United Nations must continue to be the main forum through which international co-operation is channeled.My country reiterates its support for the Organization  and its conviction that the united Nations is a fundamental component in the present set of historical circumstances and must be a fundamental component of any other plan in the future.Creativity and determination are required in the search for methods and procedures to deal with present problems  with new criteria and new organizational bases. Last year  the President of ray country  Mr. Sanguinetti  said that the United Nations had resulted from a cataclysm  the Second World War  that had killed the League of Nations* We think it would be suicidal if we had to create another organization at the price of a world war. Bather  we must improve the one we already have.Uruguay has demonstrated by deeds its intention to use all available diplomatic and political machinery to deal with the international problems that are of concern to us. Hence  we have joined in all forms of direct diplomatic action available to the President of the Republic and his Foreign Ministry in order to give effect to our aims  through diplomatic actions designed to achieve peace. My country has neither the size nor the responsibility to be a leading player on theinternational stage; all that we can do is aspire to harmonious and constructive relations with the sister republics of our continent and co-operate  to the limit of our possibilities  to ensure the achievement of peace in the world  and especially in our region.That is why we whole-heartedly support the Contadora initiative; we believe that it is a response to our profound belief that peace in Central America is an objective which goes far beyond the problems of the subregion and involves all Latin Americans. We are convinced that the worsening crisis in that part of our Latin America could unleash very dangerous tensions and conflicts throughout the region. That is why we have joined in this initiative. We feel that the strengthening of peace  progress towards pluralistic democracy  and the economic and social development of the Central American region are goals of all Latin Americans.We believe in the path of dialog rather than that of armed confrontation. We wish to show with concrete deeds that our Latin American peoples can achieve peace  development and justice without foreign interference  in accordance with their own decisions and their own historical experience. It is in order to join in those tasks - on which Latin America  the main protagonist  must take its own decisions - that we have participated and shall continue to participate in the work of Contadora  through the Support Group  of which we have the honor to be a member.The problem of the Malvinas is of equal concern to us. Last year our President stated in this Assembly.""The problem of the Malvinas is not simply a bilateral problem between Argentina and Great Britain. It is a Latin American problem  and  as such  we assume it in its full dimension. ...""We trust that Great Britain  which knew when the historical moment was ripe to abandon vast possessions all over the world  will succeed in reconciling the dictates of law with the rules of international coexistence.Hence we support Argentina's claims and we are prepared to do everything in our power to contribute to a rapprochement between those two parties at the negotiating table"". (A/40/PV.6 p. 3)All that we need add new to what was said by our President is that Uruguay is awaiting with increasing impatience the agreement of the parties to begin rapidly negotiations that can lead to a just and final solution to the problem.There are other parts of the world that cause us concern. Certain conflicts  such as the one in the Middle Bast  seem to have gone beyond the control of their protagonists. President Sanguinetti also stated here last year that in the case of the Middle East conflict the worst had happened*  it had become a routine problem which we seemed to have learned to live with.The developments in the Middle East conflict have made it difficult to conceive of any solution that would not require sacrifices on the part of everyone involved  as well as a supreme effort toward conciliation. Such a solution  as Uruguay has been saying for years now  must be based on recognition of Israel's right to continue to exist as a State within secure and recognized borders; on recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination; and on respect for the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon  whose territory must be freed of the presence of foreign armed forces  of whatever origin. We are especially disturbed by the tragedy of the Lebanese people. They have deep ties with our people  who have for many years benefited from the contribution of their hard-working  intelligent immigrants.Peace also requires the reunification of the two Koreas through dialog and negotiations.It has been said that peace must be built one day at a time  and that it must come from the heart of every person and every people.Violations of human rights continue to take place each day throughout the world. In many parts of the planet  persons and groups of persons are systematically persecuted and deprived of their basic rights? because of their race  religion or ideas. Many people continue to be subjected to various forms of political oppression or iniquitous situations in which they are deprived of their most elementary economic and social rights.But within this range of daily violations of human rights  nothing is more repugnant to the conscience of mankind than the shameful practice of apartheid  institutionalized and applied by the racist South Africa regime. My Government vigorously condemns this affront to civilization and joins in the international community's clamor for its elimination. In particular  we associate ourselves with the demand for the immediate and unconditional liberation of Nelson Mandela and other imprisoned leaders  and for the lifting of the ban on the black political organizations.In regard to the Pretoria Government's behavior  we have followed with interest the recent international trend towards the adoption of sanctions in conformity with the Charter. That would be a healthy reaction by the international community and a defense of the most sacred values of civilization and peace. My Government will associate itself with any sanctions that are adopted.There can be no peace when territories are under foreign occupation or colonial situations exist. But there are still vestiges of colonialism which  by disregarding the right of peoples to self-determination  are sources of tension and threats to the peace. We have in mind particularly the case of Namibia  whose people are subjugated and whose territory has been .illegally occupied  in open defiance of decisions and resolutions of bodies of the United Nations  including the decision of the International Court of Justice. Uruguay repeats' that the relevant resolutions of the United Nations must be immediately and unconditionally implemented. Moreover  we condemn continuing armed incursions and acts of aggression against States that are South Africa's neighbors  which often are launched from Banibian territory* that is the case particularly of the aggression against Angola.We reaffirm our solidarity with the front-line countries and we earnestly hope that in this International Year of Peace effective steps will be taken to ensure that the people of Namibia can exercise their right of self-determination and that peace and tranquility are restored to that' afflicted part of the world.As serious as the persistence of conflict in the world is the fact  generally accepted here  chat it is commonly used as an excuse to justify the most iniquitous manifestation of violence in our times; terrorism. Terrorism is the common enemy of all the peoples and Governments represented here. Uruguay does not believe that any Member of the United Nations can invoke attenuating circumstances or in any way justify terrorism  irrespective of the motive  because that would be to deny the principles which all States have undertaken to respect and promote. And let us be candid - it would also mean an unjustified act of arrogance  because no Government represented here can be certain that in the future it will not be a victim of the blackmail of terrorism. Uruguay is convinced that the international community should intensify co-operation in eliminating  or at least reducing  the tragic consequences of this scourge. whose expansion  frequency and magnitude are turning it into a real war declared against civilization.Yesterday mankind awoke to an item of news which introduces some ray of hope; I am referring to the news of the coming meeting in October between President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev to resume conversations with a view to an effective process of nuclear disarmament.The question of nuclear disarmament is of the greatest importance for all the peoples of the world  and not only for the super-Powers. Mankind lives daily with the continuing concern and anxiety regarding what is called the danger of a nuclear holocaust  in which mankind as a whole would be the victim. As the two super-Powers have stated  ""A nuclear war cannot be won and it cannot be waged"".No design for peace can overlook an important reality of today. She policies of the great Powers in the matter of armaments are decided  pursued  negotiated on  and brought into conflict every day largely in disregard of this Organization  which should be the institutional form representing the international community.It is thus with the great Powers that both the political and moral responsibility for decisions on disarmament mainly lies. In view of this situation  which is outside our control  there is not a single State whose security and existence does not in the last resort depend cm the will of the nuclear Powers and  in particular  the two super-Powers; as the Secretary-General has already stated  we are living in a state of interdependence but on a footing of inequality.In other areas there have been some promising developments  signs of progress in reducing international tensions. One of them  without any doubt is the security agreement arrived at a few days ago at the Stockholm Conference in which countries of Western and Eastern Europe  the United States and Canada participated.We have followed with keen interest and firmly support the proposals made by the six Heads of State of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and Tanzania  formulated in the city of Ixtapa  Mexico  a few weeks ago  urging the super-Powers to establish a reciprocal moratorium on nuclear testing  and the six leading statesmen of those countries proposed specific procedures for verification; they stated their willingness to participate and offered to provide means of ensuring effective compliance. They must know that they have the full support of all the countries of our continent.Uruguay also supports Brazil's proposal to associate the countries of both sides of the South Atlantic in a zone of peace and co-operation. Peace and security in this area requires that it must be used not for any threat or use of force  but instead in a way that will preserve it from any extension of the strategic-nuclear confrontation. The establishment of a zone of peace alsorequires that the violence and coercion which prevent the peoples of South Africa and Namibia from freely exercising their sovereign rights must cease.Peace  true peace  is based cm mutual trust  and the arms race is the ultimate expression of the lack of trust. We have developed considerably in terms of science and very little in terms of conscience. Will civilization be able to attain a sufficiently high ethical level to ensure that those who bear the responsibilities of government in the various countries will now take the decision to devote to the development of the peoples the resources that are now allocated to the production and purchase of weapons and instruments of destruction and death? Once we have overcome this tragic paradox of the modern world we shall have laid firm foundations for peace - of real peace  and not peace of the pax romana type imposed upon others. We must have the type of peace which can only prosper and flourish in a true community  an international society characterized by relations of equality among States  and not by the hegemony of some over others. We must have a peace which is one and indivisible  a peace of justice  one which is guaranteed by law. In this International Year of Peace we reaffirm our faith in such a peace  the only true peace  and our faith in the freedom of individuals and of peoples  without which  in the words of the eminent Uruguayan lawyer  Eduardo J Coutour  there can be no law  no justice  no peace.Never before has it been so generally felt that mankind has learn from its harsh lessons that peace is one and indivisible. Now we must learn to understand that this truth also applies to economic affairs. At this stage  it is almost impossible to deny the fact that without a prosperous economy  without integrated economic development  there can be little peace anywhere in the world. As long as in most of the world living standards are below the levels compatible with human dignity  there can be no guarantee that the rest of the world  with their prosperous economies  can continue to enjoy their prosperity in peace. Want andconspicuous consumption do not make good neighbors who can live together without friction and conflict in a world that is steadily shrinking and becoming more interdependent.This philosophy was the inspiration of a life which has now ended. A distinguished Latin American  the noted Argentinian Dr. Raul Prebisch  for decades worked in the United Nations and in the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) - to which he was so devoted - for an international co-operation founded on great moral principles  in a world based on standards of solidarity which unhappily seem to have been forgotten. In this year of his passing  the message of his life and of his moral ideals should be a further inspiration to us in building a more just international economic order  an essential requisite of any lasting peace. I wish to take this occasion to pay a heartfelt and grateful tribute to his memory.There is still little sign of a system of international relations based on principles of equity and equal opportunity. Some problems that were touched on here by the President of Uruguay last year  such as the problem of indebtedness  have been remedied to some extent  but we are far from having fully achieved the hopes of the countries that joined in the Cartagena consensus. But some hopeful signs for change emerged from the recent conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at Punta del Este in Uruguay. That was the beginning of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations  which was undoubtedly one of the most significant developments of the year in economic affairs. The importance of that conference lies in the fact that agreement was reached on beginning a new round of trade negotiations in such unfavorable political and economic circumstances  a success hardly to be expected in view of the gloomy outlook before the meeting. However  even more important  in fact vital  is that the agreement  which will be tested over four years of difficult negotiations  must above all be regarded as a declaration of peace in the trade war.Uruguay trusts that the spirit of conciliation that prevailed at that meeting will ensure that it will also become a basic instrument of the trade peace so essential for the fate of the world and particularly of the developing countries. Punta del Este produced a peace with neither victors nor vanquished. That is the basis of any serious and durable commitment.As the International Year of Peace draws to a close  it seems fitting to devote a moment to introspection and to ask ourselves whether  as Members of the United Nations family  as representatives of our Governments  as individuals  we have done and are doing everything we can to move closer to achieving that goal. Peace can only be the outcome of the concerted will of all States  renewed and strengthened day after day.Uruguay hopes that each one of us to whom a role has been entrusted in the international life of peoples will make peace his daily goal and each coming day an international day of peace."
"139",7237,"USA",41,1986,"A short walk from this Hall is the delegates' Meditation Room  a refuge from a world deafened by the noise of strife and violence. ""We want to bring back the idea of worship""  Dag Haramarskjold once said about this room  ""devotion to something which is greater and higher than we are ourselves"".It is just such devotion that gave birth to the United Nations: devotion to the dream of world peace and freedom  of human rights and democratic self-determination  of a time when  in those ancient words  ""... they shall beat their swords into plowshares ... nation shall not lift up sword against nation  neither shall they learn war any more"".The United States remains committed to the United Nations. For over 40 years  this Organization has provided an international forum for harmonizing conflicting national interests and has made a significant contribution in such fields as peace-keeping  humanitarian assistance  and eradicating disease. Yet  no one knows better than those in this Hall how the noble ideals embodied in the Charter have often remained unfulfilled. This Organization itself faces a critical hour - thatis usually stated as a fiscal crisis. But we can turn this ""crisis"" into an opportunity. The important reforms proposed by the Group of Experts can be a first step towards restoring this Organization's status and effectiveness. The issue  ultimately  is not one of cash but of credibility. If all the Members of this universal Organization decide to seize the moment and turn the rhetoric of reform into reality  the future of the United Nations will be secure. And members have my word for it: My country  which has always given the United Nations generous support  will continue to play a leading role in the effort to achieve its noble purposes.When I came before the Assembly last year  an important moment in the pursuit of those purposes had not yet occurred. The leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States were to meet in Geneva. These discussions have now been held. For over 15 hours  the Soviet and American delegations met. For about five hours  General Secretary Gorbachev and I talked alone.Our talks were frank. The talks were also productive - in a larger sense than even the documents that were agreed. Mr. Gorbachev was blunt; so was I. We came to realize again the truth of the statement: Nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed; they are armed because they mistrust each other. And I did not hesitate to tell Mr. Gorbachev our view of the source of that mistrust: the Soviet Union's record of seeking to impose its ideology and rule on others. So we acknowledged the deep and abiding differences between our systems of government  our views of history  and the future of mankind. But  despite these differences  we resolved to work together for real reductions in nuclear arms  as well as progress in other areas.Delegates to the forty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  today I want to report to you on what has transpired since the summit  notably the important letter X sent on 25 July to Mr. Gorbachev. In that letter  I dealt with the important issues of reducing nuclear arms  agreeing on strategic defenses  and limiting nuclear testing. In addition to those issues  which concern the military aspects of Soviet-American relations  I would also like to address other essential steps towards peace: the resolution of political conflicts  the strengthening of the international economy  and the protection of human rights.Before I do this  however  let me  in the tradition of candor established at Geneva  tell you that a pall has been cast over our relations with the Soviet Union. I refer here to a particularly disturbing example of Soviet transgressions against human rights.Recently - after the arrest of a Soviet national and united Nations employee accused of espionage in the United States - an American correspondent in Moscow was made the subject of fabricated accusations and trumped-up charges. He was arrested and jailed in a callous disregard of due process and numerous human rights conventions. In effect  he was taken as a hostage - even threatened with the death penalty.Both individuals have now been remanded to their respective ambassadors. But this is only an interim step  agreed to by the United States for humanitarian reasons  it does not change the facts of the case: Gennadi Zakharov is an accused spy who should stand trial; Nicholas Daniloff is an innocent hostage who should be released. The Soviet Union bears the responsibility for the consequences of its action. Misusing the United Nations for the purposes of espionage does a grave disservice to this Organization.The world expects better. It expects contributions to the cause of peace that only the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union can make.It is for this reason that I wrote last summer to Mr. Gorbachev with new arms control proposals. Before discussing the proposals  let us be clear about which weapons are the most dangerous and threatening to peace. The threat does not come from defensive systems  which are a shield against attack  but from offensive weapons - ballistic missiles that hurtle through space and can wreak mass destruction on the surface of the Earth - especially the Soviet Union's heavy  accurate ICBMs  with multiple warheads  which have no counterparts in size or number in any other country.That is why the United States has long urged radical  equitable  verifiable reductions in these offensive systems. Note that I said reduction; for this is the real purpose of arms control: not just to codify the levels of today's arsenals  not just to channel their further expansion  but to reduce them in ways that will reduce the danger of war. Indeed  the United States believes the prospect of a future without such weapons cf mass destruction must be the ultimate goal of arms control.I am pleased to say that the Soviet Union has now embraced our idea of radical reductions in offensive systems. At the Geneva summit last November  we agreed to intensify work in this area. Since then  the Soviets have made detailed proposals which  while not acceptable to us  appear to represent a serious effort. So we continue to seek a 50 per cent reduction of American and Soviet arsenals - with the central focus on the reduction of ballistic missile warheads. If the Soviet Union wants only a lesser reduction  however  we are prepared to consider it but as an interim measure. In other provisions as well  we have sought to take account of Soviet concerns. So there has been movement.Similarly  in the area of intermediate-range nuclear forces  the United States seeks the total elimination of such missiles on a global basis. Again  if the Soviet Union insists on pursuing such a goal in stages  we are prepared to conclude an interim agreement without delay.All this gives me hope. I can tell representatives that the exchanges between our two sides this summer could well have marked the beginning of serious  productive negotiation on arms reductions. The ice of the negotiating stalemate could break  if both sides intensify their effort in the new round of Geneva talks and if we keep the promises we made to each other last November.For too long a time  however  the Soviet response has been to downplay the need for offensive reductions. When the United States began work technology to make offensive nuclear weapons obsolete some day  the Soviets tried to make that the main issue - as if the main danger to strategic stability was a defense against missiles that is still on the drawing boards  rather than the menacing ballistic missiles themselves that already exist in excessive numbers.Still  the United States recognizes that both the offensive and defensive sides of the strategic equation must be addressed. And we have gone far to meet Soviet concerns expressed about the potential offensive use of strategic defensive systems. I have offered firm and concrete assurances that our strategic defense initiative could never be used to deploy weapons in space that can cause mass destruction on earth. I have pointed out that the radical reduction we seek now in offensive arsenals would be additional insurance that strategic defense initiative cannot be used to support a first-strike strategy. Our preference from the beginning has been to move forward co-operatively with the Soviets on strategic defenses  so that neither side will feel threatened and both can benefit from the strategic revolution that strategic defense initiative represents.The United States continues to respect the anti-ballistic missile Treaty - in spite of clear evidence that the Soviets are violating it. We have told the Soviets that  if we can both agree on radical reductions in strategic offensive weapons  we are prepared right now to sign ah agreement with them on research  development  testing and deployment of strategic defenses based on the following.First  both sides would agree to confine themselves  through 1991  to research  development and testing  which are permitted by the anti-ballistic missile Treaty  to determine whether advanced systems of strategic defense are technically feasible.Secondly  a new treaty  signed now  would provide that  if after 1991 either side should decide to deploy such a system  that side would be obliged to offer a plan for sharing the benefits of strategic defense and eliminating offensive ballistic missiles. This plan would be negotiated over a two-year period.Thirdly  if the two sides cannot agree after two years of negotiation  either side would be free to deploy an advanced strategic defensive system  after giving six months* notice to the other.As the United States has repeatedly made clear  we are moving towards a future of greater reliance upon strategic defense. The United States remains prepared to talk about how - under what ground rules and process - we and the Soviet Union can do this co-operatively. Such strategic defenses  coupled with radical reductions in offensive forces  would represent a safer balance and give future statesmen the opportunity to move beyond it - to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.In addition to our proposals on offensive reductions and strategic defense  we have suggested new steps in another area - nuclear testing. Just as eliminating all nuclear weapons is our long-term goal  so too is a total ban on nucleartesting; but both must be approached with practical steps. For the reality is that for now we still must rely on these weapons for the deterrence of war; thus the safety and reliability of our deterrent are themselves critical to peace.The United States is proud of its record of nuclear safety and intends to maintain it. Nevertheless  we are as I said  ready now to take two important steps towards limiting nuclear testing: first  we ace ready to move forward on ratification of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Treaty on Peaceful Nuclear Explosions  once agreement is reached on improved verification procedures. We have proposed new ideas to make this possible; secondly  upon ratification of those treaties - and in association with a program to reduce and ultimately eliminate all nuclear weapons - we are prepared to discuss ways to implement a step-by-step parallel program of limiting and ultimately ending nuclear testing.Those are steps that we could take in the near future to show the world that we are moving forward. I therefore call upon the Soviet Union to join us in practical  attainable progress in limiting nuclear testing.Just a few days ago I received a reply from General Secretary Gorbachev to my letter of 25 July - and  for the moment  let me say simply that we are giving itAs we move towards our goal of eliminating nuclear weapons  it is vital that we also address important imbalances in other kinds of weapons. This is why the United States has proposed a comprehensive global ban on all chemical weapons and why we and our allies have tried hard to break the stalemate in the conventional force negotiations in Vienna. In the Stockholm Conference a major advance has been achieved: a concrete new set of military confidence-building measures whichBut we must remember from the experience of the 1970s that progress in arms control cannot be divorced from regional political developments. As I said at the beginning  political tensions cause military competition  not the other way around.However  while the United States and the Soviet Union disagree over the root causes of political tension  we agree that regional conflicts could escalate into global confrontation. Last year  from this rostrum  I presented a formula for peace which would apply to five critical regional conflicts that are potential flash points for wider conflicts. I pointed out how difficult it is for the United States to accept Soviet assurances of peaceful intent when 126 000 Soviet troops prosecute a vicious war against the Afghan people; when 140 000 Soviet-backed Vietnamese soldiers wage war on the people of Cambodia; when 1 700 Soviet advisers and 2 500 Cuban combat troops are involved in military planning and operations in Ethiopia; when 1 300 Soviet military advisers and 36 000 Cuban troops direct and participate in combat operations to prop up an unpopular  repressive regime in Angola; when hundreds of millions of dollars in Soviet arms and Soviet-bloc advisers help a dictatorial regime in Nicaragua try to subvert and betray a popular revolution.The danger inherent in these conflicts must be recognized. Marxist-Leninist regimes tend to wage war as readily against their neighbors as they routinely do against their own people. In fact  the internal and external wars often become indistinguishable. In Afghanistan  for example  the puppet regime has announced its intention to relocate tens of thousands of people from border areas  Can anyone doubt this will be done in classic communist style - by force? Many will die  to make it easier for the Soviets and their satellite troops to intimidate Pakistan.It is just such transgressions that make the risk o£ confrontation with democratic nations so acute. So  once again  I propose a three-point peace process for the resolution of regional conflicts: first  talks between the warring parties themselves  without which an end to violence and national reconciliation are impossible; secondly  discussions between the united States and the Soviet Union - not to impose solutions but to support peace talks and eventually eliminate the supply of arms ^and the proxy troops from abroad; thirdly  if the talks are successful  joint efforts to welcome each country back into the world economy and the community of nations that respect human rights.In addition to regional disputes  the grave threat of terrorism also jeopardizes the hopes for peace. No cause  no grievance can justify it. Terrorism is heinous and intolerable. It is the crime of cowards - cowards who prey on the innocent  the defenseless  and the helpless.With its allies and other nations  the United States has taken steps to counter terrorism directly - particularly State-sponsored terrorism. Last April  the United States demonstrated that it will defend its interests and act against terrorist aggression. Let me assure all of you today  especially let me assure any potential sponsors of terrorism  that the American people are of one mind on this issue. Like other civilized peoples of the world  we have reached our limit. Attacks against our citizens or our interests will not go unanswered.We will also do all in our power to help other law-abiding nations threatened by terrorist attacks. To that end  the United States believes that the understandings reached by the seven industrial democracies at the Tokyo summit last May made a good start towards international accord in the war on terrorism. We recommend to the General Assembly consideration of the Tokyo resolutions.Moving to the economic realm  how ironic it is that some continue to espouse such ideus as a ""new international economic order"" based on State control when the world is learning  as never before  that the freedom of the individual  not the power of the State  is the key to economic dynamism and growth. Nations have turned away from centralized management and government controls and towards the incentives and rewards of the free market. They have invited their citizens'to develop their talents and abilities to the fullest and  in the process  to provide jobs  to create wealth  to build social stability and foster faith in the future for all. The economic summits of the industrial democracies have paid a tribute to these principles - as has the historic United Nations special session on Africa inHay. We applaud the African nations' call for reform leading to greater reliance on their private sectors for economic growth. We believe that overcoming hunger and economic stagnation requires policies that encourage Africa's own productivity and initiative; such a policy framework will make it easier for the rest of the world  including the United States  to help. The laws of economic incentives do not discriminate between developed and developing countries. They apply to all equally.Much of the recent recovery in the world economy can be directly attributed to this growth of economic freedom. And it is this trend that offers such hope for the future. And yet this new hope faces a grave threat: the menace of trade barriers. History shows that the imposition of such barriers invites retaliation  which in turn sparks the very sort of trade wars that plunged the world in the 1930s deeper into depression and economic misery. Truly  protectionism is destructionism.That is why the United States seeks the assistance of all countries represented here in the General Assembly in protecting the practice of free and fair trade. We applaud the success of the meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) trade ministers last week in Uruguay  where agreement was reached to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations covering a wide range of topics important to economic growth  with over 90 other countries members of GATT  the United States is working to maintain the free flow of international trade.In addition to resistance to protectionism  the United States is also seeking to stimulate world economic growth in other ways. Our Treasury bill interest rate is now just over 5 per cent  the lowest it has been in nine years - which provides enormous relief to debtor countries. America's new tax structure will open the way for greater prosperity at home  which will contribute to greater prosperity abroad.Finally  the united States is working with other countries to minimize currency swings  to promote stability in the monetary markets  to establish predictability as a basis for prosperity.But  the United States believes the greatest contribution we can make to world prosperity is the continued advocacy of the magic of the market-place - the truth  the simple and proven truth  that economic development is an outgrowth of economic freedom just as economic freedom is the inseparable twin of political freedom and democratic government.And it is here that we come to our final category - human rights - the indispensable element for peace  freedom  and prosperity. I note that Mr. Gorbachev has used in recent speeches the same categories I have used here todays the military  the political  and the economic; except that he titled his fourth category: humanitarian.The difference is revealing. The United States believes that respect for the individual  for the dignity of the human person - those rights outlined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Hunt i Rights - does not belong in the realm of charity or ""humanitarian"" causes. Respect for human rights is not social work; it is not merely an act of compassion  it is the first obligation of government and the source of its legitimacy.It also is the foundation-stone in any structure of world peace. All through history  it has been the dictatorships and the tyrannies that have surrendered first to the cult of militarism and the pursuit of war. Countries based on the consent of the governed  countries that recognize the inalienable rights of the individual  do not make war on each other. Peace is more than just an absence of war. True peace is justice  true peace is freedom. And true peace dictates the recognition of human rights.Commitments were made more than 10 years ago in Helsinki concerning those rights and their recognition. We need only look to the East today to see how sadly unfulfilled those commitments are. The persecution of scientists  religious leaders  peace activists  political dissenters  and other prisoners of conscience continues unabated behind the Iron Curtain. You know  one section of the Helsinki Accords even speaks to: ""improvement of working conditions of journalists"".So  it is clear that progress in the human rights area must keep pace with progress in other areas. A failure on this score will hinder further movement in East-West relations.These  then  are the areas of concern and of opportunity that the United States sees in the quest for peace and freedom - the twin objectives of the United Nations Charter.Last year  I pointed out in my address to the General Assembly the differences between the United States and the Soviet Union are deep and abiding. But I also called for a fresh start in relations between our two nations  a fresh start that could benefit our own people and the people of every nation. Since that time  the United States has taken action and put forth new proposals that could lead our two countries and the entire world in a direction we all have long sought to go. Now more than ever  it is the responsibility of the Soviet Union to take action and demonstrate that they too are continuing the dialog for peace.As I have said  I believe that we can be hopeful about the world and the prospects for freedom. We only need look around us to see the new technologies that may some day spare future generations the nightmare of nuclear terror  or the growing ranks of democratic activists and freedom fighters  or the increasing movement towards free market economies  or the extent of world-wide concern about the rights of the individual in the face of brute  State power.In the past  when I have noted such trends - when I have called for a ""forward strategy for freedom"" and predicted the ultimate triumph of democratic rule over totalitarianism - some have accused me of telling people what they want to hear  of urging them not: to engage the day but to escape it.Yet  to hope is to believe in humanity; and in its future. Hope remains the highest reality  the age-old power; hope is at the root of all the great ideas and causes that have bettered the lot of humankind across the centuries.History teaches us to hope - for it teaches us about man  and about the irrepressible human spirit  A Nobel laureate in literature  a great figure of the American South  William Faulkner  once said that the last sound heard on earth would be that of the two remaining humans arguing over where to go in the spaceship they had built. In his speech to the Nobel Committee in 1950  Faulkner spoke of the nuclear age  of the general and universal physical fear it had engendered  a fear of destruction that had become almost unbearable. But  he said:""I decline to accept the end of a man. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal ... because he has a soul  a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.""Faulkner spoke of the old verities and truths of the heart  of the courage  honor  pride  compassion  pity  sacrifice and  yes  that hope which is the glory of our past. And all of these things we find today in our present; we must use them to build our future. It is why today we can lift up our spirits and our hearts; it is why we resolve that with God's help the cause of humanity will not merely endure but prevail; that some day all the world - every nation  every people  every person - will know the blessings of peace and see the light of freedom."
"140",7307,"VCT",41,1986," On behalf of the Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  I extend our heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Choudhury on his unanimous and well-deserved election as President of the forty-first session of the General Assembly. My delegation shares fully the warm sentiments expressed by previous speakers with regard to his outstanding merits  and I am confident that under his skillful guidance this session will achieve significant results. His election is also a tribute to his country  Bangladesh.I should also like to extend ay delegation's praise to his predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies of Spain  for the efficient manner in which he performed his duties and for his achievements during the historic fortieth session of the General Assembly.Not least we wish to express our profound admiration for the courage and untiring dedication of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who  despite his major heart operation  continues the fight for humanity. The Government and people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines whole-heartedly support his efforts.My Government hopes that the financial crisis at the United Nations will be resolved. We are aware that there are two causative factors. States are overwhelmed by the debts they have created for themselves and suffer disillusionment that in turn stems from two sources  the first being dissatisfaction about voting patterns at the United Nations and its agencies and the second the lack of priorities in certain expenditures.There are many agencies in the world where the value of the vote is related to the size of the contribution. It is important that the united Nations not be structured in that way. The equality enshrined among us ensures that the genuine collective will of this world finds a single forum for expression.We  the small nations of the world  whose contributions are very modest but to which the existence of the United Nations is most important  would want to see a vibrant United Nations. Perhaps the United Nations has been too ambitious  expanding too many Programs in too many areas too quickly. This has always meant the expansion of administrative costs  and in the long run we get away from serving the basic principles of the Charter.We would hope that in the restructuring that is being undertaken the opportunities for the meaningful participation of those of us that are relatively new Members of this Organization will not be eroded.The delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines would want the administration of the United Nations to continue to put its house in order  and we pledge our support to the Secretary-General both in his pursuit of his objective and in the wider mandate of bringing peace to the troubled areas of the world.There is a lot to be done. Let us begin."
"141",7354,"VEN",41,1986," I extend Venezuela's congratulations to Ambassador Choudhury on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly  and to reiterate our pleasure at the intelligent and expert manner in which Ambassador Jaime de Pinies guided the work of the Assembly during a year that was significant for the United Nations in so many ways.Venezuela is once again addressing the General Assembly to confirm its commitment to the fundamental principles of the United Nations and to make its voice heard in defense of the ideals of peace and international coexistence  which warranted the Organization's coming into being in historical circumstances.It is not idle to stress that mankind is living through a period characterized by difficulties and challenges of every kind. We are living in a period of confusion and undeniable risks. At times such as these  one can easily lose faith in human beings and in their potential to build and maintain an international order free from violence and the urge for hegemony in inter-State relations. As Saint-John Perse said: ""After all  it is man who is at stake"" (mais c'est de l'homme qu'il s'agit).Despite every obstacle and the innumerable pitfalls facing the United Nations during its relatively brief history  the Organization still represents a crucial factor in the struggle for reason in the present international context. The criticisms that are sometimes leveled at it often lose sight of the deep meaning of the existence of an organization in which it is still possible to convene the overwhelming majority of States in order to urge them to face their problems by means of dialog and civilized debate.While it is true that since the Second World War there has not been another general conflagration  it is likewise undeniable that the precarious ""nuclear peace"" is not a voluntary arrangement  and much less is it reassuring. Rather  it is the result of an endless rivalry for power rooted in fear  insecurity and the quest for domination by some States over others. In the present international context it would seem that we have no choice but to conceive of peace merely as a balance of power - which is at all times threatened. It is true  the balance of power does contribute to puace  but in no way does it guarantee it.If we recall the origins of the two most ruinous military confrontations of this century  we see that although the most recent world war broke out because of the imbalance of power in Europe the first of those wars was unleashed despite the existence of what was at the time seen as a stable balance of power.Those thoughts point in a clear direction: in our nuclear age  when mankind can see the risk of self-destruction with frightening clarity  we cannot rely exclusively on the balance of power to maintain peace; It is essential to go beyond this narrow approach and build more genuinely solid foundations for peace.We are speaking of a peace based on the principles of a deeply humanistic ethic  on the values of tolerance  dialog and international co-operation. This is how we see the mission of the United Nations - as an effort that is for everrenewed to give peace the support of ethical values  of agreements freely entered into  which will make it possible to coexist free from hegemony. We do not believe that to be an illusion.Venezuela views with deep concern the alarming pace of the nuclear and conventional arms race  which seems to be a paranoid advance and  worse yet  one in constant acceleration.We feel duty bound to confirm our commitment to the goals of disarmament and arms control  and our hope that negotiations under way in various forums on these matters will move forward steadily. We  the small and medium-sized nations  have the duty and the right to raise our voices as many times as may be necessary to give warning of the dangers that loom on the horizon and concern us all.We object to any attempt to militarize outer space  which some seek to present as a panacea and the definitive course for the future elimination of the nuclear threat; but which  in fact  is nothing more than a new attempt to escape from the political and ethical dilemmas of our times with ever more advanced  complex  illusory and costly technological formulas.In this respect  it is fitting to point out that the technological obsession  as revealed by the production of increasingly sophisticated and destructive arms systems  is little by little becoming an end in itself  while seriously weakening the political and ethical controls which should guide relations among States. We therefore insist that the arms race continues to subject us to grave and immeasurable threats to our species and planet. We shall never stop denouncing those threats as being absurd. Quite simply  we cannot be resigned to a precarious and uncontrollable situation.Heightened East-West tensions  based on the overflow of nuclear arsenals  the growing use of military force  and great-Power intervention in various regional scenarios - these are other symptoms of deterioration which augur ill for world peace and stability.Given this persistence of interests seeking to restore the rigidity of a bipolar world  those countries that wish to maintain a position of critical independence  diplomatic flexibility and political autonomy affirm the principles of genuine non-alignment before this Assembly.During the past decade the countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America had many expectations of the global North-South process of negotiations  intended progressively to lessen the vast disparities between the economies of the industrialized countries and those of the less privileged peoples. The present situation has become extremely paradoxical: the economic and social crisis besetting the developing countries is perhaps more serious than ever before  and yet the political will of the most powerful to help tackle that crisis is in a state of constant decline.Apparently there is no perception whatsoever of the risks of this spectacle of impoverishment and socio-economic backwardness. What is at issue here is a threat to world peace  arising from the clamor and anguish of vast sectors of mankind for whom the future seems to hold no promise and who are left with a sense of uncertainty.We would violate an elementary rule of balance were we not to point out the positive changes that have occurred in the global context. As Latin Americans  we feel that one of the most encouraging changes in recent years has been the return to democracy  which has happened gradually over almost all of Latin America.For years it was Venezuela's fate to live in a continent where authoritarian regimes were predominant. We can still see tragic realities of dictatorships on the map of Latin America. Repressions and mass violations of fundamental human rights have become the distinctive features of those Governments. Nevertheless  the surge towards democracy has an irrepressible impetus.We are aware that it will not be easy to maintain democracy in our region  because the authoritarian regimes left behind a legacy of deep political wounds and grave socio-economic crises. Nevertheless  Venezuela trusts that this time the democratic process will prove to be lasting and irreversible. As the President of Venezuela recently said:""The democratic Governments of Latin America must now strengthen their societies  their economies and their rules of the game in politics  in conditions that are hardly favorable. Venezuela is deeply committed to the process of building a hemisphere where freedom flourishes  and moving towards development with a social content. Our solidarity with the best Latin American causes is beyond question.""It is this feeling of solidarity which pron^ts us to bring before this Assembly the distressing and conflicting economic reality which overwhelms Latin America  severely obstructing any hope that our peoples may reach better standards of living.The diagnosis of experts and specialized agencies gives us a precise idea of the situation. Most of our countries are undergoing the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Per capita income in the region has declined by approximately 9 per cent since 1980 down to the 1977 levels  and in some countries to those of 1960. Unemployment and underemployment have risen to 50 per cent in some access. There is galloping inflation of almost 50 per cent in the region as a whole. The external debt is estimated at between $380 billion and $400 billion -an outrageous amount  which stifles our possibilities for development  particularly bearing in mind that close to 50 per cent of Latin America's export earnings is used for the payment of interest. In fact / recent years  our countries transferred about $106 billion to the industrialized countries - a burden which  in relative terms  is double the war reparations that Germany had to pay during the 1920s  as was pointed out recently by a United States expert.The strange reverse net transfer of resources from South to North  that is to say  from developing to developed countries  is analyzed in detail in the 1986 United Nations World Economic Survey. It was emphasized at the last session of the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1986/56  which refers consideration of this distressing and untenable phenomenon to this Assembly. As Willi Brandt says in his recent book. Weapons and Hunger  this is a ""blood transfusion from the sick to the healthy"".Therefore it is obvious that we are facing a potentially explosive situation  one that will require an unusual effort of joint action. The Latin American democracies have borne their share of the responsibility for finding a way out of this crisis. Indeed  in our countries  even though faced with extremely severe conditions  we have been implementing policies for a rational and well-thought-out management of economic life.We must repeat: the external debt burden and the rising tide of economic protectionism  which has now become almost the rule of conduct among the industrialized countries  are curtailing the capacity for progress of the nations of the developing world. This situation must and inevitably will change. It is our hope that these changes will take place on the basis of dialog and concerted action  guided by a positive realization of the common destiny of mankind.It is in this spirit that the countries of the Group of 77 have brought before this forum the need to give priority consideration to the item ""Interrelated areas of money  finance  debt  flow of resources  trade and development""  including the preparation of an international conference on money and finance for development  with full participation.We trust that the recently approved new round of trade negotiations will make it possible to restore the multilateral character which a system of international trade should have and which  as is well known  has been seriously eroded in recent years. The drafting of multilateral principles and norms to broaden the area oftrade to include new areas  such as services  should not condition or delay a solution to the immediate problem of ever-growing protectionism  which detracts from the credibiH :y of the system and constantly affects the prospects for growth and diversification of the developing countries  through their exports.Venezuela regrets that the new round will not be open and unconditional for the developing countries  as was to be expected of an international effort to bring constructive solutions to current problems and to draw up a trade system that would respond to the collective interest.The United Nations has repeatedly given development priority among its considerations. We believe the time has come to stress further the importance of this key problem  as it is a fundamental challenge of our times. We must  through this Organization  discover new ways to make it possible to resume the multilateral efforts which only a few years ago were on the verge of providing promising results. Venezuela will be prepared to co-operate without hesitation in advancing plans for joint North-South and South-South action  which we have supported in the past and shall continue to support.Tensions in Central America have been and are the subject of the most careful scrutiny by the democratic States of Latin America. The persevering  patient and resolute action for peace by the Contadora Group and the Support Group prove that we are able to find a Latin American response to crucial problems in the region.Venezuela is part of the initiative of the Contadora Group  being convinced that we must be prepared to explore every avenue to find peaceful outcomes to conflicts in the area and that every type of effort must be made to do away with the hostile atmosphere  which could lead to a general and fratricidal war in that long-suffering region.What the Contadora Group and the Support Group are doing constitutes political action the merit of which has been to keep alive the possibility of dialog. We are firmly convinced of the value of this instrument for bringing about an atmosphere of mutual trust and ensuring that there is the political will on all sides to reach the final objective: to sign and inclement the Contadora Act for Peace and Co-operation in Central America. We shall not tire in our steadfast efforts.We believe that there are sufficient reasons to persist along this path  provided that there is an end to the obstinate attitude of those interests which are determined to prolong the atmosphere of confrontation prevailing in the area  spurred on by the intervention of outside factors that obstruct the attainment of a negotiated settlement of the crisis.Peace in Central America will not become a reality unless the States of the region themselves  not acting under external pressures  reach agreements that make coexistence possible  with a pluralistic democracy  on the basis of respect for the self-determination of peoples.Venezuela is unreservedly committed to the protection of fundamental human rights  and it has been a primary objective of the Government of Venezuela to give due guarantees for freedom and for human dignity in every sphere. This is not a circumstantial posture to be maintained for a limited time or in a given area. On the contrary  it is an irrevocable conviction and a constitutional mandate of our democratic system  which in turn encourages and improves the equality and justice of Venezuelan democracy.In accordance with its principles  Venezuela participates with great interest in the United Nations organs dealing with human rights  so as to give impetus to and support all actions aimed at bringing about positive changes in countries which present scenarios of persistent violations of such rights. At the same time  we have given a vote of confidence to countries which have finally succeeded in crossing the threshold to freedom and have taken a democratic course; for  as we see it  the defense and consolidation of this way of life is the ideal and practical formula for ensuring full respect for human rights.During 1986 several international meetings were held on what remains a formidable challenge for the United Nations. I am referring to the persistence of the policy of apartheid and to one of its external manifestations: the illegal occupation of Namibia. I had the opportunity to participate in the International Conference for the Immediate Independence of Namibia  which was held in Vienna in June of this year. The final Declaration of that Conference reaffirms  once again  that the only basis for the peaceful settlement of the problem is the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). At the time Venezuela  as a member of the Security Council  gave its full support to the adoption of that resolution. Venezuela has requested and resolutely supported the application of mandatory sanctions as provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter  so that the constant threat of South African policies to world peace will not continue and become more acute.We are witnessing a situation of deep-rooted upheaval which jeopardizes international peace and security and which is becoming increasingly alarming. The escalation of terrorist acts indiscriminately endangers fundamental human values  such as the right to life  to peace  to freedom and to confidence. There is no reason or goal that can justify the use of terror in desperate attempts to achieve certain objectives. We are convinced that international solidarity can lead to joint efforts aimed at promoting an atmosphere of confidence that will make it possible to eliminate such criminal manifestations.Every day the problem of drug abuse and illicit traffic in drugs demands more and more careful attention by Governments. It requires firm policies and effective acts of international co-operation  that are appropriate to the challenge we face.Mankind is threatened and we must have an international instrument to enable us to punish the crime and focus on the social and economic roots of the problem. At the thirty-ninth session of the General Assembly President Lissinchi warned of the dangers for the internal and external security of countries created by the illicit traffic in drugs which has even altered relations among them. To quote the President of Venezuela  these dangers include attempts to ""destabilize Governments through corruption  making use of all kinds of criminal elements  tying them into an intricate network of operations  conspiracies and complicities which involve all levels of society  from subversives of the left and right to the most affluent and most impoverished of our citizenry  striking at the very heart of public life. ... its penetration ... has reached such a magnitude that ... drug trafficking not only represents a threat to the national security and sovereignty of several countries but is also turning into a dangerous agent of international conflicts."" In this connection  I should like to express the appreciation of my Government to the Secretary-General and his supporting staff for the preparation of the draft international convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. This will enable us to have in a very short time a comprehensive text with the observations of many Member States  in particular those where the problem of the illicit traffic in and use of drugs is of major importance. As will be recalled  in 1984 Guatemala advocated the idea of a new convention to cover aspects which had not been anticipated in the international instruments now in force.The International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking is to be held in 1987. It has been convened by the Secretary-General for the purpoe of generating universal action to combat the drug problem in all its forms and at all levels and to approve a plan for future action on the problem. Both initiatives have the support of the Government of Venezuela.Venezuela is committed to the strengthening of the United Nations and will decisively challenge any attempts to make it inoperative or set it aside as one more symbol of lost illusions. He reaffirm this commitment especially at this time of crisis and downgrading of the programs of multilateral action established to find solutions to the grave problems that afflict so many countries.In our view  rationalization criteria are necessary to enable the United Nations to make the best use of both its financial and its human resources  and of the effective support of Member States in this joint effort.In signing the San Francisco Charter we entered into commitments which ve have invariably complied with  even in the worst times; these have never been an excuse to fail to comply with our budgetary responsibilities as far as the United Nations is concerned.Since January of this year Venezuela has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the third time. We have played our part in dealing with the delicate matters considered by it  guided by principles of balance  moderation and harmonious coexistence  in the search for possible solutions and a lessening of tensions throughout the world.On reviewing the Secretary-General's report to this session we find statements made with authority and common sense. Its more general outlines on the possibilities of solving world conflicts give us much food for thought. We find particularly striking a paragraph which sums up the whole significance of the role that multilateralism should play in our times  and I shall quote it: It reads: ""The strengthening and revitalization of the present structure of multilateral institutions is critical to the resolution of problems confronting  the international community relating to peace  security and development. To ignore this necessity is to imperil the future prospects of a better world."" We support the Secretary-General's guidelines with the same conviction. Their implementation would strengthen the ability of the United Nations to give clear leadership in the economic field. We must remember the self-evident truth that the solution of many economic problems would bring with it a lessening of tensions.On the fifth anniversary of the mandate given to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar as Secretary-General of the United Nations we wish to convey our appreciation to him for his outstanding work  in which he has clearly shown his ability to handle with dignity and dedication the setbacks which our supreme multilateral forum has been facing.In th is International Year of Peace  we reaffirm our confidence in a more prom is ing future for all the peoples of the world. We shall not falter in our efforts  as a country which yearns for peace and development and is struggling to achieve them  in the firm conviction that peace and development are indivisible."
"142",7393,"VNM",41,1986,"First of all  Sir  I should like to extend my warm congratulations to Mr. Choudhury on his election to the presidency of the forty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I wish him every success in his important task. I also express our deep appreciation of the fruitful efforts made by the Secretary-General of our Organization in the cause of international peace and security and friendship and co-operation among nations.As we entered the year 1986 there were hopeful signs of a relaxation of international tension. That dawning hope  however  is still clouded by the specter of extermination.At this session of the General Assembly  in this International Year of Peace  apart from a broad range of questions included in the agenda there are many new problems of major significance that concern the survival and development of mankind. These problems require from the international community appropriate answers and common efforts to bring to a satisfactory conclusion the final years of this century and cross the threshold of the third millennium of our history with a new position and in more favorable conditions.The history of our time since the Second world War has proved ever more clearly that while the struggle for peace  freedom and happiness becomes as ever keener and fiercer  peace and peaceful coexistence between different socio-political regimes have become an irrepressible objective law as a result of the growing awareness of States and peoples of issues concerning their survival and development. That awakening has truly become an unassailable spiritual and material force  whose most striking result is that mankind has been able to live free of a world war for the past 40 years. Europe  in spite of several decades of extreme tension caused by the cold war  has been able to establish and maintain a framework of peaceful coexistence in the face of numerous challenges. The recent success of the Stockholm Conference has once again confirmed this. However  no one can forget the continuing presence in that continent of the world's two strongest opposing military blocs  or that the arms race  intensified by the United States  constantly threatens to upset the strategic balance and provoke a nuclear conflagration that would mean the annihilation of mankind.In the region of Asia and the Pacific  where for the past 40 years the peoples have never really known peace  but instead have had to face a succession of the longest  bloodiest wars  and which today remains a turbulent region  the solid beginnings of progress towards the establishment of a zone of peace  friendship and co-operation have emerged.The successive great victories in the struggle of the peoples of Asia and the Pacific for independence  freedom  peace and social progress and the exceptional growth of peace-loving  revolutionary forces have brought about profound changes in the character of the region  compelling certain ruling groups to accept  tardily  but more fully each day  the evident reality and the course of historical development.The will of the peoples of Asia and the Pacific for peaceful coexistence  co-operation and friendship is becoming increasingly urgent*  generates the strength to guarantee peace and security in their own region and in the whole world. The initiatives of the People's Republic of Mongolia concerning a treaty on the non-use of force or the threat of the use of force between the States of the region and the initiative of the Soviet Union cm the establishment of a general system of security in the Asia and the Pacific  as well as the efforts to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace  are all realistic initiatives. The same is true of the initiatives aimed at making South-East Asia a zone of peace  stability and co-operation and South-East Asia  the South Pacific region and the Korean peninsula nuclear-free zones.All those initiatives create enormous possibilities for assuring regional peace and security on the basis of national independence and sovereignty and for strengthening mutually beneficial co-operation in the economic  commercial and scientific and technical spheres among the nations of the region and between them and States outside the region.The world rejoices  with a note of caution  at positive developments in recent years in the Asian-Pacific area and particularly at the prospect of a brighter and healthier political atmosphere in that part of the world. However  because of the policies pursued by certain imperialist and militarist circles  which continue to intensify the arms race  to cause tension and to attempt to turn Asia into a theater of military and political confrontation  explosive and destabilizing factors nevertheless remain in the region  such as the presence of American troops in South Korea and attempts to perpetuate the division of Korea - including the use of the United Nations to legalize the division of that country; the presence of foreign military bases; the moves to form bilateral or trilateral military alliances; the many obstacles to the convening of a conference to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace; the undeclared wars waged against the People's Republic of Kampuchea and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan; the attempt to partition Micronesia and to turn it into a neo-colony; the delay imposed on the process of decolonization of New Caledonia and the continued occupation of East Timor  and so on.Having been the victim of several foreign aggressions  the Vietnamese people earnestly desire peace in order to rebuild their country. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  like the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea  want to seek through dialog a political solution to the problems concerning South-East Asia  including the question of Kampuchea. Developments in and around South-East Asia have shown that confrontation is in the process of being replaced by dialog and that differences are gradually being narrowed. Besides Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea  many other concerned parties have  either openly or tacitly  agreed that the two basic questions for a political solution to the Kampuchean question are the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the elimination of the genocidal Pol Pot clique. The remaining differences concern means of implementation as regards those two questions.Some people clamor for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea without  however  referring to the need to end all support for the genocidal Pol Pot clique  which is living in exile in a neighboring country and nurtures the hope of returning to power in Kampuchea. A certain individual claims to be a friend of the Kampuchean people  a defender of human rights and the right to self-determination and a champion of the struggle against terrorism and colonialism  while deliberately ignoring the fact that Pol Pot and his clique  now under the deceptive cloak of the democratic coalition  have committed genocidal crimes unprecedented in the annals of history.In barely four years in power - from 1975 to 1978 - they massacred nearly half of their compatriots and instigated armed conflicts with all the neighboring countries  the one with Viet Nam turning into a bloody border war aimed at expanding their monstrous civilization to the very doors of Ho Chi Minh City. As he consigns the tragic past of the Kampuchean people to oblivion  that same individual should ask himself whose friend he is. Is he defending human rights and the right to self-determination for the Kampuchean people and other ethical principles or is he defending the genocidal clique?There are those in this forum who used to be satellites of imperialism in the war of aggression against Viet Nam and accomplices of those treacherous puppets Nguyen Van Thieu and Lon Nol and who subsequently provided sanctuary to the remnants of Pol Pot's forces or served as the spawning ground for the so-called coalition of Democratic Kampuchea - that anomalous hybrid created to serve as a cover for the Pol Pot clique  thus continuously fostering the danger of renewed genocide in Kampuchea. Is it not shameful for them now to lecture Viet Nam on anti-colonialism and to demand that Viet Nam engage in a strange dialog with the clique of perpetrators of genocide  supposedly to realize the right to self-determination of the Kampuchean people?The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Kampuchea  prompted by a full understanding of their responsibilities  have agreed and many times declared to their own peoples and those of the world that the voluntary withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Kampuchea  which has been partially carried out every year for the past five years  will be completed by the year 1990  when the Kampuchean revolutionary armed forces will be strong enough to ensure the security of their own country.Thus  the highly important task that remains to be undertaken - a task more realistic and useful than clamoring for something that is already being done - is to endeavor to find a satisfactory solution to the Kampuchean problem. That solution must be based on the guaranteed withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and  at the same time  the elimination of the Pol Pot clique  as well as on a guarantee for the process of national reconciliation in Kampuchea without the danger of further acts of genocide. Such a solution would allow Viet Nam to withdraw all its troops before the scheduled 1990 deadline. On the contrary any solution which demands that Viet Nam withdraw its forces before that deadline without reference to the cessation of all aid to the genocidal clique  will in fact have the effect of hindering Viet Nam's troop withdrawal plan and blocking the search for a political solution. Thus it is clear that no appropriate solution can be based on the so-called eight-point proposal  which was supported by only three Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries and one ncn-ASEAN country  at the recent summit Conference of the non-aligned countries in Harare.Those eight points are in fact merely an attempt to use the pretext of a political solution to bring the criminal Pol Pot clique back to power in Kampuchea  an attempt that has failed in spite of all efforts - military attempts included -during the past eight years.In the course of the past seven years the United Nations  misled by the item entitled ""The situation in Kampuchea"" included in the agendas of successive sessions of the United Nations General Assembly at the request of the ASEAN countries  and under direct pressure from certain parties whose hands are not altogether clean  has adopted erroneous resolutions in total contradiction of the resolutions on South-East Asia adopted by consensus by two thirds of the countries represented here at the seventh summit Conference of the non-aligned countries in New Delhi and the recent eighth summit Conference in Harare. While the objective and constructive resolutions of the non-aligned movement on South-Bast Asia have encouraged the process of fruitful dialog in the region  the mistaken United Nations resolutions on the situation in Kampuchea have given a distorted picture of the situation there and provided support for the Pol Pot clique  thus conflicting with the vital interests of the Kampuchean people and hindering and undermining the current process of dialog. Moreover  as the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea has stated on many occasions  the discussion of the item  ""The situation in Kampuchea""  without its consent constitutes gross interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign country  in brazen violation of the United Nations Charter.In the present situation  a turning point is necessary in the United Nations approach to questions relating to South-East Asia  including that of Kampuchea  so that this Organization can play its full role in promoting the process of dialog which has already started between the parties concerned outside the United Nations framework.In the search for a political solution to the question of ensuring peace  stability and co-operation in South-East Asia  and also throughout the Asian-Pacific region  relations of friendship and co-operation between the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of China could play a very important role. The Vietnamese people greatly treasure their traditional friendship with the Chinese people. In the past the two peoples supported each other and were united in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The two countries have common interests*  in peace  independence and development. Wishing to restore normal relations with China  Viet Nam has  on many occasions  declared its readiness to negotiate with China at any level  at any time and anywhere  so as to resolve the substantive questions concerning relations between the two countries and other natters of mutual concern in the higher interests of peace and co-operation between the two peoples and in the region as a whole.We believe to solve differences through dialog without pre-conditions would be easier  more realistic and more fruitful than to try to solve them without any dialog in a hostile atmosphere.We share the view of certain political circles in the ASEAN countries that the so-called Kampuchean problem will sooner or later solve itself with the growth of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. What is of more far-reaching  decisive significance is to have a broader vision - in terms of time and space - which allows us to perceive now a comprehensive solution for South-East Asia and for the Asian-Pacific region as a whole. This will be essential in the ""post-Kampuchea"" period  a period which will have begun by 1990 at the latest  with or without a political solution regarding Kampuchea.The United States has an important role to play with regard to peace  stability and co-operation in Asia and the Pacific  and should therefore have found an appropriate way to assume that role in a constructive manner. The Vietnamese people are ready to turn to a new chapter and to facilitate the development of relations of friendship and co-operation between the two peoples.Time waits for no man. Artificial obstacles should be removed as quickly as possible  and the process of dialog should be given new impetus  and we should co-operate in resolving together  in this International Year of Peace  the problems before us in response to the demands of our times  as our turbulent century draws to a close.In other regions of the world  especially in Africa  the Middle East  and in Central America and the Caribbean  as a result of profound changes brought about by the march of history  but against the wishes of the imperialist forces  the situation has become more and more turbulent. While the imperialists persist in attempting to maintain the old order imposed by them  a series of young States have come into being  ridding themselves of colonial domination and freely choosing their own path of development in the very areas considered to be imperialism's strategic positions. At the same time  liberation movements are surging forward with unprecedented vigor  striving to eliminate the last bastions of colonialism and puppet regimes which are traitors to their peoples. No longer able to have things their own way  these in imperialist and colonialist circles are at times compelled to declare their readiness to negotiate political solutions  but they have in i>o way renounced their policy of using for us to serve their hegemonic ends. While anxious to avoid another Viet Nam  they are prepared to undertake direct armed intervention whenever and wherever they can. More particularly  they engage in war by proxy. State terrorism  political and economic coercion and the instigation and organization of subversive activities against countries that refuse to submit to their diktat  notably the Republic of Cuba.Viet Nam fully endorses the common position expressed at the eighth summit Conference of non-aligned countries  held recently in Harare  categorically condemning the criminal activities of imperialism  colonialism  apartheid  Zionism and other reactionary forces and affirming the most resolute support for struggling peoples. Now more than ever  it is the duty of all mankind to show solidarity with and give assistance in all spheres to the peoples of South Africa  under the leadership of the African National Congress of South Africa  and of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  and to the front-line States in southern Africa with a view to the elimination of apartheid. Our vigorous support and effective assistance must also be extended to the people of Nicaragua in its struggle in defense of its independence and sovereignty-  tothe Palestinian people  whose authentic representative is the Palestine Liberation Organization  and other Arab peoples in their struggle against the Israeli Zionists and their masters; to the Libyan people in their struggle against the policy of State terrorism practised by certain imperialist forces; to the Saharan people in its struggle for the full exercise of its right of self-determination; and to the peoples of El Salvador  Puerto Rico and other lands striving for independence and freedom.In addition to political and military threats  the developing countries are confronting serious economic challenges which are the result of colonialism and the present unjust economic order. Because of that economic order and in conditions of the increasing internationalization of the forces of production and growing international trade  the developing countries  which have already been heavily exploited  will be exploited even further. These economic challenges not only hinder the development of those countries but threaten their very existence. In a world of economic interdependence  economic challenges affect not only the exploited countries but the entire world economy. That is why the relevant decisions of the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations on the establishment of a new international economic order are in keeping with the interests of all States. In this new situation we need not only a new long-term approach but also urgent action by the international community.It is time for those that enriched themselves thanks to the old order  that are in the habit of exploiting others by means of unfair co-operative relations and the use of economic coercion as an instrument of hegemony and domination  to reconsider their policies and play a constructive part in the implementation of the economic programs and strategies adopted by the United Nations  in the common interest of all peoples and in their own interest.The groundwork has been laid for a world in which mankind can live in equality and freedom  working and co-operating in peace and friendship  free of the danger of nuclear holocaust*  a world in which regional conflicts are settled not by force but through dialog and where ideological differences do not impede co-operation for the well-being of mankind.With the aim of achieving that noble ambition  the participants in the eighth summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of non-Aligned Countries  meeting at Harare  made the following appeal*.""In fact  today the choice is no longer between war and peace  but rather between life and death. Thus  the struggle for peace and against nuclear war is the principal task of our time.""We must respond with goodwill to peace initiatives from various sources  which are vital for the future of mankind. I am thinking in particular of the initiative concerning the elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000  the initiative on the establishment of a general system of international security  and the New Delhi appeal by the Heads of State or Government of Argentina  Greece  India  Mexico  Sweden and Tanzania. There must be an immediate  appropriate response to the Soviet Union's repeated extension of its unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests.The time has come to translate the fine words about a desire for peace into deeds. it is also time for those in the most warlike ruling circles to reconsider their persistence in a position which runs counter to that of all peace-loving mankind - that is  their continuing intensification of the arms race on earth and in outer space and their attempts to abrogate important disarmament treaties concluded after long and difficult negotiations. In a world that must choose between life and death  any rejection of peace initiatives that could be decisive for the survival of our planet constitutes a crime against humanity."
"143",7427,"VUT",41,1986," Mr. President  I have the honor to convey to you the congratulations and best wishes of the Government and people of the Republic of Vanuatu. Your unanimous election to preside over the forty-first session of the General Assembly is a tribute to you and to the Government and people of Bangladesh. We add our voice to that of those who have already spoken so eloquently of your broad experience  your skills and your dedication to the principles and ideals which unite us in this world body.We congratulate your illustrious predecessor  Jaime de Pinies  for the outstanding manner in which he carried out the duties of President. We also associate ourselves with the many expressions of appreciation and praise for the work of our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.We are pleased to see that the Secretary-General's health has been restored. It is to be hoped that we  the nations of the world  will ease the burden of his high office by following up our expressions of praise with concrete deeds that are consistent with our Charter and the sentiments expressed by those moving words. Matching our deeds to the words might assure the future good health of our Secretary-General and the United Nations itself. Such a course of action might even assure the good health of our very troubled world.Last year at this time we gathered to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of our Organization. For a brief period  the world's attention was focused on the United Nations and the dramatic activities here at Headquarters. A few observers were drawn to  and mesmerized by  the obvious glamor and excitement of that historic event. Most  however  waited anxiously for the results of our thought and reflection on what had been achieved during our first 40 years and what had not  where we have been and where we are going. For us  and for most of the world  it was less a period of celebration and more a period of critical evaluation.Today   we are not commemorating a notable anniversary. There fore  fewer cameras  microphones  flashbulbs and notepads are present. Fewer words are written  fewer said  and even fewer listened to. None the less  what we say and do at this session will be just as important and crucial to the future of the human race as what was said and done at the last session.This year  the mood is quieter and more subdued. The airports  hotels and restaurants of our host city are not quite as crowded today as they were cone year ago. The streets and highways approaching the United Nations are not as jammed with official motorcades  and the general public is not- as affected by  and therefore not as concerned with  our deliberations. However  as little has changed foe the better since we -last met  our current session is  in a very real sense  every bit as dramatic  urgent and intense as the last. A cursory glance around the globe reveals why.The prisons of South Africa are even fuller than they were one year ago. The refugee camps that house the people of Palestine are even more crowded than they were one year ago. More people have been killed as a result of the senseless and tragic war between Iran and Iraq. In Lebanon  more children have been deprived of the innocence of youth and turned into soldiers as even more death and destruction have been visited upon that once serene land. Cyprus continues to be divided and occupied by a powerful neighbor.More debt has accumulated in South America  threatening that continent's democratic advances. More firepower and less development aid has been pledged to the people of Central America  and new obstacles have been placed in the path of the Contadora process. A few still speak of the ""five"" States in Central America  forgetting the existence of Belize  and the fact that it is a home to many refugees and that it  too  is vulnerable to the region's instability.The people of Kampuchea and Afghanistan are no closer to being allowed to live in peace and choose their own destinies  free from all forms of foreign interference  than they were one year ago. The people of East Timor  and those of other territories in our region  are no closer to being free to determine their own futures that they were one year ago.We are no closer to seeing a referendum held in Western Sahara than we were last year at this time. South Africa is no closer to aiding its illegal occupation of Namibia than it was one year ago. Certain foreign economic interests are no closer to ending their illegal and immoral looting and pillage of Namibia's resources than they were one year ago.The illegal traffic in deadly drugs has increased  and more young lives have been ruined  if not ended  as a result. Individual and State terrorism continue unabated in absolute defiance of every known standard of decency and common sense. France continues to test its nuclear weapons in our region  disregarding the objections of the countries of the region and the harm caused to our environment.Throughout the world  more people are hungry  homeless  unemployed and  as a result  frustrated or without hope. Gaps in real income between nations and between individuals have widened. Everywhere one looks  the rich have become richer and the poor have become poorer. Yet  somehow  in the midst of all of this  the inventory of nuclear weapons has grown larger.Despite all of this  there is a faint glimmer of hope. FOr millions of people in every corner of the earth  the United Nations still represents mankind's finest qualities. It symbolizes their dream of justice  equality  and peace. They care little about celebrations and commemorations. Diplomatic dinners and receptions are very remote to them  but the United Nations and its specialized agencies are not. That is why we must make sure that the Organization is not destroyed or emasculated  but instead strengthened and made even more relevant.The financial crisis facing the United Nations is  as everyone knows  in reality a major political crisis. As such  it commands our attention and demands  above all else  our candor.A great deal has been written  and even more has been said  on the subject of the imperfections of the United Nations. Critics point to our lengthy debates  repetitive speeches  strident resolutions  and our frequent waste and inefficiency. The criticisms are not completely without merit. There is considerable room for improvement.However  one must ask why the United Nations' most vociferous critics do not begin with a candid self-examination. What measures have they taken to correct similar  if not worse  shortcomings  in the various national and local governmental bodies of their own respective jurisdictions? Are we to believe that the United Nations is unique in its frequent waste and inefficiency? Is this the only place where there are too many lengthy speeches and too many divisive resolutions? Of course not.Let us pause for a moment and carefully consider what the most vocal critics have to say about the excessive number of resolutions passed each year. We happen to agree with that criticism. However  it does not go far enough. We should also ask why Cyprus is still occupied*  why the Palestinians still can't go home or even call their hone their home; why apartheid still exists in South Africa; why Namibia is still not interdependently so many other questions on our agenda are unresolved.Had the earlier  more moderate resolutions been implemented  most of those problems would have been resolved  and others might not have arisen. If today's resolutions are more militant  or strident in tone  the fault may not lieexclusively with the authors of the resolutions. Those who  while haying it in their power to restrain or reform those States that have ignored their obligations under our Charter  have chosen not to exercise that power  must also share the responsibility. Their repeated failure to help us implement the expressed will of the international community has led to the situation they now abhor.The occasional inability to be exact and concise in our various resolutions is  we agree  a serious and regrettable deficiency. However  it is a deficiency of form. On the other hand  actively frustrating the will of our international democracy in so many instances is a substantive shortcoming. That is even more regrettable.There is no doubt that we should consider changes in some of our practices and procedures  and perhaps even in some aspects of the structure of the United Nations. However  we must be careful not  as the saying goes  ""to throw out the baby with the bath water"". Change and reform are two-way avenues. We cannot be expected to consider making some changes but not others. Nor can we reform the Organization without a willingness by most of our Members to modify their behavior and a willingness by other to reform themselves.The report of the Group of High-Lev el Intergovernmental Experts is an important document. It is obvious that considerable thought and effort have been expended in its preparation. We commend the Group of 18 for its labor on our behalf. The conclusions of their report merit our careful consideration  as it is obvious that we have reached a critical stage in the history of this Organization and another very critical stage in the process of international co-operation.This year  as in past years  we have been reminded of mankind's vulnerabilities and imperfections. In lands an geographically removed from each other as the Solomon Islands and the Cameroons  death and destruction have struck without warning  in the form of an unusually severe cyclone in one instance and of a volcanic gas leak in the other. It is almost as if nature had chosen those harsh methods of delivering a painful reminder of its mystery  its power and the fact that as individual nations we are all vulnerable.In lands as politically remote from each other as the United States and the Soviet Union  two separate incidents involving imperfect technology and human miscalculation have caused major disasters that have.had an impact upon and traumatized people far beyond the borders of those two powerful States. The tragic explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and the equally tragic accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant point to mankind's scientific imperfections and the very thin margin of error between scientific progress and disaster. In a related sense those two accidents also bring to mind the thin margin of error between the policy of nuclear deterrence and the potential accidental nuclear annihilation of the entire human race. They remind us that unless we work together no amount of technology can save our species from its own inventions.How many more reminders will have to be given before an even greater disaster occurs? what further lesson do we peed? Must we see more evidence of the homicidal and suicidal nature of the nuclear-arms race or may we finally say that enough is not only enough but more than enough?As President Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev prepare for their second summit meeting we note the positive step evidenced by the recently concluded Stockholm accord. It is to be hoped that the flexibility demonstrated in the final stages of the negotiation of that accord and the trust and confidence evidenced in its terms will enable them to take further steps on the long road to a lasting and stable peace.The establishment of trust and confidence in Europe is but one dimension of the world-wide search for peace. Trust and confidence in the process of multilateralism must also be evident in our work here at the united Nations  to ensure the continued relevance of the Organization and its value to future generations. Not one of our countries  large or small  East or West  North or South  can afford to denigrate this Organization in word or deed. We all need the United Nations. Some of us simply recognize that we need it more than others of us care to admit.I now turn to southern Africa. That area  more than any other  tests the will and resolve of the international community. The late W. E. B. DuBois wrote in his most noted passage that ""the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line"". I doubt that this renowned historian  despite his wisdom and acumen  knew how prophetic those words would be. He was born in a society that had only recently ended its own form of legalized slavery. Racism was still prevalent in the land of his birth. Segregation was the accepted code of behavior. Africa  Asia and the Caribbean were colonized. The peoples of those regions were locked in the grip of those who saw them as mere subhuman producers of raw materials for their hungry factories.A great deal has changed since his time. DuBois and others managed  through decades of difficult struggle  to overcome the segregationists and change the face and the soul of the land of their birth. Their children now know hope where before they knew only despair. Most of the countries of Africa  Asia and the Caribbean are  through the efforts of their respective peoples  now politically independent. Their children also know hope where once they knew only despair.Unfortunately  South Africa is a land untouched by the passage of time. Despite its twentieth century technology  its people continue to be victims of the backward attitudes of the nineteenth century. Even in death South Africa's people are victimized. A few weeks ago  at a place called Evander  177 human beings lost their lives in a gold-mine accident. That disaster could have been avoided but concern for the safety of African miners is not an attribute of South Africa. The company involved identified the five dead whites by name  occupation and marital status and gave details of how many children each had. The 172 dead blacks were identified only as members of different tribes. Even in death they were given no dignity. This was not South Africa's worst mining accident and it is not the worst example of the South African regime's inhumanity. It is  however  a good example of how pervasive that regime's racism is. Recent cosmetic changes are almost meaningless. Despite the efforts of some to paint a different picture  its intransigence and unwillingness to change in any substantive manner are as evident today as they were yesterday.The apartheid regime is not content with terrorizing the people of South Africa. Its system has also been imposed on the people of Namibia and threatens the survival of each of the front-line States. That regime  in fact  challenges every member of the United Nations.None of us could possibly accept such behavior in our own countries  why  then  do we still permit those storm troopers in Pretoria to call themselves a legitimate Government? Why do some of us still hesitate to align ourselves with the people who seek nothing more than the right to walk the land of their own country as free human beings? Why do same of us close our eyes to the fact that the Pretoria regime has already imposed sanctions on neighboring African States in an effort to make them betray their own principles and their own people? How can those who oppose sanctions claim to be motivated by concern for South Africa's black population when apartheid itself is nothing more than the institutionalization of sanctions against that same population? How much longer must the world wait for some finally to decide to join the battle against this evil? What degree of brutality and callousness will finally move them to action? Must we wait until the next century for their attitudes to catch up with those of this century?Turning to our own area  the South Pacific  we draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact that ours is a part of the world that contains many of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories. We seldom fail to mention this  because nothing poses a graver threat to the stability and tranquility of our region and nothing is in greater contradiction of the Charter of the United Nations and its various pronouncements.In the modern world colonialism is just as much an anachronism as apartheid. What could be more outdated than the notion that the people of any territory are incapable of deciding for themselves who they are  what they wish to be and how they choose to live? That is why the maintenance of colonialism in the midst of the South Pacific region is unacceptable. The States of our region speak with one clear voice on the subject. We are as convinced of this as are the States of other regions that colonialism has no place in their midst.In August  the Heads of Government of the 13 member States of the South Pacific Forum decided to ask the United Nations to place New Caledonia on its list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. That step had been considered in the past but had not been taken. In the past  the Forum countries believed that the administering Power recognized its responsibilities in the area of decolonization and that it would act accordingly. The events of the past year have now convinced us otherwise.In September  the Heads of State or Government of the 101-member Movement of Non-Aligned Countries supported our regional initiative. At the eighth summit conference in Harare  Zimbabwe  the Heads of State or Government strongly urged the forty-first session of the General Assembly to place New Caledonia on the list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. They also admitted New Caledonia's independence movement  the Front de Liberation Nationale Ranak et Socialiste (FLNRS) as an observer. Vanuatu  having joined in those unanimous decisions  now anticipates that the General Assembly will itself take appropriate action.He seek no quarrel with the administering Power and will not be provoked into one. If we are called names or if stones are cast in our direction we will not respond in kind. The principles involved are too lofty  our Charter is too explicit and the various resolutions are too clear for us to allow ourselves to be dragged into such a useless and senseless exercise.We have been told that this is all our fault. How can that be so? It was not Vanuatu that colonized New Caledonia. It was not Vanuatu that drafted the Charter of the United Nations. It was not Vanuatu that was the author of the various resolutions on decolonization. It was not a representative of Vanuatu who first uttered the words ""liberty  equality  fraternity"".We cannot take individual credit. Vanuatu is only one of 13 countries in the South Pacific For una  one of 99 countries and two liberation movements in the Hon-Aligned Movement and one of 159 coin tries in the United Nations.On another day  we were told that Australia was to blame* on another day  it was New Zealand> on another  Fiji ; on yet another  Papua New Guinea; and on other days the Solomon Islands or Samoa. Everyone has been given credit for causing the case of New Caledonia to be brought to the united Nations except the one party which really deserves the credit; the administering Power. It chose not to proceed with what it had promised the colonized people of New Caledonia. Therefore it can blame no one but itself.We have also been bold that economic aid to Vanuatu will be terminated if we persist in bringing the question of New Caledonia to the united Nations. This is a most unfortunate suggestion. Naturally we do not want to see this aid terminated. Vanuatu is  after all  a small developing country. In fact it is one of the least developed countries. However  we will not be intimidated in this way or in any other manner.Similar threats have been made and carried out against other countries. Vanuatu is not the first and will probably not be the last to be threatened in this fashion. We regret this  but such is life. We have always believed that the administering Power is above such actions. We still hope that it is. However  if it is not  Vanuatu will survive  and New Caledonia will still become independent. Nothing will stop that process.Finally  we were also told that the Political Declaration by the Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Coin tries was meaningless. ""They do not mean it "" we were told. ""They will change their minds when they get to the United Nations "" we heard.We find it incredible that anyone should believe that the leaders of the non-aligned countries are not serious when they issue a political declaration. It is fathomable to us that anyone would believe that they do not mean what they say and say what they mean. How could anyone expect representatives of the non-aligned countries at the United Nations to act contrary to a clear and explicit declaration made by their Heads of state or Government?More incredibly  how could anyone expect non-aligned Members of the United Nations to forget their own histories and reverse a unanimous summit decision on what is clearly a decolonization question? How could anyone expect any Member of the United Nations to say that the United Nations should not even consider a colonial question? How can anyone question the competence of the United Nations to consider this Batter? Who aiaong us is prepared to take the floor and express a lack of confidence in the fairness and objectivity of the decolonization process that we ourselves have established and that we ourselves monitor? Vanuatu would never ask any nation to do anything that is so patently at odds with its own principles and the Charter. we hope that France  the administering Power in New Caledonia  would not consider asking any nation to do such a thing.Prance is still our friend  its representatives and its nationals are in all sincerity welcome in Vanuatu. We anticipate that they will also be welcome in an independent New Caledonia. We fully understand the political constraints and other difficulties facing France in New Caledonia due to the presence of a large settler population. It has faced similar constraints before  as have other administering Powers.The independence movement and the countries of the region are anxious to work constructively with the French Government in the decolonization process. That is why we wish to have the United Nations play its customary role. What could be more reasonable?Indonesia  our large and influential neighbor  is a country we respect. We have always admired its struggle to free itself from colonialism. Everyone knows that we have also on occasion disagreed with some of its policies in our area. Despite these areas of disagreement  Vanuatu has always considered itself a friend of Indonesia and always will.On roost matters we concur. On a few we do not. However  we listen attentively to Indonesia's position on those subjects. We analyze what is said and carefully note the areas in which  as a matter of principle  we do not agree and those in which we do agree.Nothing is static. Only evolution is a constant. We have never feared to let Indonesia know where we have disagreed. Similarly  we do not fear to let it know where we* agree. We do so today once again as a candid friend.We are pleased by the ability of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to address some of the problems that have arisen along their border in a positive and conciliatory manner. As a Melanesian State sharing a rich cultural heritage with other Melanesian peoples  Vanuatu appreciates the measures taken to assure the survival of cultural diversity and ethnic pluralism in our region. We commend Indonesia and Papua New Guinea for the steps they have taken in this regard. Both deserve a great deal of credit and support for these initiatives and those to follow.On East Timor  we support the Secretary-General's attempts to bring about an acceptable solution. His humanitarian efforts merit the support of the entire international community. The negotiations between Portugal and Indonesia are an encouraging sign. As we have always stated  we will support the genuine wishes of the people of the Territory  nothing more and nothing less.R Ours is a monumental task. The United Nations is charged with considering and resolving major issues some of which seem in one form or another to have vexed mankind almost from the beginning of recorded history. There are still no easy answers or quick solutions to any of these issues.Just as nature's process of creating oil or precious minerals took centuries of agitation and ferment of various elements  so too will the process of creating a better future take years of effort by every nation represented in this Hall  andr-some that are not yet represented here. We have begun that process. Let us continue it  and let us bequeath to future generations' the ability and the means to improve upon the humble efforts of this generation. ."
"144",7461,"WSM",41,1986,"Mr. President  my delegation is reassured to know that this difficult forty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly is being steered by a statesman of your ability  from a country with which we share warm friendship and co-operation in several forums  including the Commonwealth and the Group of Least Developed Countries  where Banqladesh's role is appreciativelyacknowledged with appreciation.We must also thank Mr. Jaime de Pinies for his dignified and efficient conduct of the historic fortieth session. We are also reassured and gladdened by the Secretary-General's welcome recovery and return to us. We are  more than ever  in need of his experience and wisdom.If last year was one for reflection and reaffirmation of faith  this year is surely the year for action and reform - indeed a year of reckoning - and the most urgent item with which we must wrestle is the survival of this Organization and its continuance in the most effective and efficient manner. Small States  like ourselves  need the United Nations and have shared the belief  expressed so often during this debate  that the United Nations would become a truly effective collective security organization. While we continue in that belief  the reality of it is yet far from realization. What we  as small States  have to ensure is that the United Nations not only survives its current crisis but comes through the stronger for it. The Group of 18  whose establishment we endorsed  has worked hard towards this end. My delegation feels that  given the constraints under which itwas operating and the very real political differences which exist on the subject of reform  the report it has produced is a very constructive and useful step forward. We support those elements on which consensus was reached and  in regard to chapter 6  we support a reform of the budget formulation and decision-makinq process. We look to this Assembly to arrive at a consensus which will ensure that the views of both the major contributors and the small States are taken into account. We are encouraged by the Secretary-General's comments in document A/41/663 indicating that he has already taken steps to ensure that the Secretariat is in a position to start the process of reform as soon as the decisions of the General Assembly are known. Now it is up to all of us  and we for our part are optimistic. We trust that these hopes will not be dashed by major contributors continuing to withhold funds despite our efforts.The Secretary-General has used a dramatic analogy. He says: ""that the safety net which the United Nations constitutes for the world's security should not be allowed to become tattered"". In Samoa we have a saying that is perhaps akin to this. We say that ""the fishing net that became entangled in the night will be disentangled in the morning"". Thus we believe that  no matter what the difficulties or how knotty the problems  they can be resolved in the light of reason and good faith and thus the net be repaired. We are convinced that we can restore confidence in this organization and in its role.To turn to the broader scene  my delegation finds it ironically sad that in this International Year of Peace so little real peace has come to the troubled parts of the world.In South Africa there is no peace for children languishing in gaols and no prospects for peace while the South African Government turns deaf ears to the cries of suffering and to the dire warnings that have been given by many. Thesewarnings include that of the Commonwealth Group of Eminent Persons. We support the Commonwealth proposals for action and believe that pressure from the world coMunity is imperative.We also wish to see a peaceful Namibia  free from South African illegal occupation and brought to its rightful place in the world community through the United Nations plan.In Afghanistan foreign forces remain  and children have no peace in which to play and for playthings only bombs disguised as toys.The Iran-Iraq war drags desperately on  with massive losses of young lives that have known no peace in their short span.Lebanon is still tragically strife-torn  with brother fighting brother in conflicts still fueled by outside interference and with little hope of peace in sight.In Democratic Kampuchea people who have known no peace for generations still suffer. Foreign forces remain  and despite the efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and the new eight-poi*. approach proposed by the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  response is lacking and peace seems far off.In Korea a people is still divided and knows no permanent peace. We support the peaceful reunification of Korea and  as an interim measure  the admission of both Koreas to the United Nations  which should increase the opportunities for peaceful contact between them. In Central America also  despite the efforts of the Contadora and the Support Group  peace is still elusive. The Middle East peace process hae round to a halt and the Arab-Israeli conflict continues. There is little likelihood of peace there till direct peace negotiations  with the participation of all concerned  are undertaken. Meanwhile  the very symbols of our peace-keeping efforts  the united Nations peace-keeping forces  are targeted and slain in direct defiance of our collective aspirations for peace. Finally  while terrorism is rampant there can be no guarantee of peace for any of us anywhere on this Earth.While the Secretary-General and his representatives have been tireless in their efforts to bring the spirit of this year to bear on the situation wherever possible - and ther-a are some glimmers of hope - there is no way for peace to prevail while countries still persist in flouting the principles of the Charter.In our part of the world  the South Pacific Forum members have taken several decisions that are intended to preserve the peace and security of our region. At their meeting last year the Forum Heads of Government adopted the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty  and at this year's meeting they adopted three protocols calling on the five major nuclear-weapon States to respect the Treaty. We have been gratified by the favorable international reaction to the Treaty and pleased that several of the nuclear-weapon States have indicated their readiness to sign the protocols. We would urge those that have so far given no response to acknowledge the deeply felt concerns of our region  to sign the protocols as soon as they are open for signature and to adhere to them henceforth.People sometimes think of the South Pacific as peaceful and pristine and remote from the world's problems. They forget that our region more than any other has been used and abused as a testing ground by nuclear-weapon States. It has also been contemplated as a convenient dumping ground for nuclear wastes. The countries of the South Pacific are united in their absolute opposition to any such use of our environment. We are united in outrage that the French Government continues to test nuclear weapons at Mururoa Atoll. This testing is in flagrant disregard of our constant calls for it to cease.This testing takes place in the heart of Polynesia. As a Polynesian country  Samoa has long asked that  if this testing is so safe and of such great importance to the security of metropolitan France  France do it on its own territory and free us in the Pacific from the fear of disaster and of damage of an irreversible kind to us and our surroundings.This fear  and the deep concern felt so keenly by small Pacific Island states because of both the fragility of our environment and the vulnerability of our peoples in the face of nuclear disaster  testing or dumping  is echoed across the seas by others in similar surroundings. This shared concern was most eloquently voiced here several days ago by the Honorable I.ester Bird  Deputy Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda  a sister small island country. He said:""We in the Caribbean have good reason to sympathize with our sister States in the Pacific that have been distressed for years over nuclear tests conducted by larger States and the dumping of nuclear wastes. We share the deep-seated fears of the Pacific Island countries about the long-term medical effects of exposure to radiation and the contamination of the environment  including marine life and food crops  which could be caused by nuclear activity.All of out fears are justified  and for this reason we have for many years joined in efforts here to promote the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty. We see this as one of the most urgent and practical steps to slow down the deadly arms race and decrease nuclear dangers. We will continue to press for this and other measures designed to halt the arms race.We were encouraged that two draft conventions in the field of nuclear safety were finalized at the recent International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meeting in Vienna  and that it appears that the super-Powers intend to abide by them. Surely they must realize  in the wake of the tragic disasters experienced by them both in the past year  that no nation  however mighty  is technologically invincible or free from human frailty. We are much saddened by these tragedies and the loss of life involved. We would hope  however  that these experiences might prove to the super-Powers how imperative it is that they work together  both in sharing technology for the safety and benefit of mankind and in eliminating nuclear weapons and the chance of nuclear disaster from this Earth.The successful outcome of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe and the holding of the preparatory summit in Iceland this week-end give us cause for hope and we pray that this may be fulfilled.Last year we celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. This year  as we in Samoa look back over 25 years of successful decolonization action by the United Nations and look forward to next year and our own silver jubilee  marking our 25 years of independence  we wish to congratulate the United Nations on its tremendous achievements in this area and the very positive role it has played both in our region and in other parts of the world.However  in the South Pacific the process is not yet complete. We are anxious for those that have not yet fulfilled the aspirations of their peoples to share in this historical process and join us as full members of our Pacific community.We are  indeed  pleased that the peoples of Micronesia have had the chance freely to express their views and have done so under the supervision of United Nations Missions  which have included representatives of South Pacific countries. Thus tine principles of the Charter and of resolution 1514 (XV) are being observed  and it is for this reason that the Forum countries are firm in their support for the termination of the trusteeship. We welcomed the decision of the Trusteeship Council in this regard on 28 May this year.In New Caledonia  however  the United Nations has not yet played an active role in the decolonization process  and the Forum leaders  at their recent meeting  took tine decision to seek the re-inscription of New Caledonia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. This decision reflects the concern of the For urn to see""a peaceful transition to an independent New Caledonia in accordance with the innate rights and aspirations of the indigenous people and in a manner which guarantees the rights and interests of all inhabitants of this multiracial society"".The Forum members expressed their disappointment that the present French Government seems to be going back on previous commitments entered into with all parties in New Caledonia to see the Territory move to a form of independence and  instead  now seem intent on New Caledonia's remaining a Territory of France. Forum leaders emphasized the importance of genuine dialog with all the parties concerned  including France  and their wish to continue their efforts in this regard. It is hoped that United Nations participation will not only enhance theseefforts but assist the progress of New Caledonia to the exercise of a truly legitimate act of self-determination monitored by the United Nations. We feel this to be essential for the peace and stability of the South Pacific region.We welcome the assurance of support for this move by the non-aligned Heads of State or Government in Harare and look forward to working with non-aligned delegations here and to gaining the widest possible support from the membership ofthis Organization.During this General Assembly we shall mark the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the two human rights Covenants. Yet  sadly  violations of human rights of the vilest kind still shame the human race. Here  just as in other areas I have mentioned and many others that 1 have not had the time to touch on  eternal vigilance is required. The United Nations has so much to do and so many needing or depending on its efforts that we cannot afford to let it fail.We in Samoa hold firmly the deep conviction that  with God's help and our own efforts  this Organization will be restored to the vision its founders held 41 years ago."
"145",7502,"YEM",41,1986," As I stand before the General Assembly today to make a statement on behalf of my country  the Yemen Arab Republic  I find myself at a loss. Do I congratulate the President on his assumption of the presidency  or do I congratulate the Assembly. In any case  his election could not have been a more judicious choice in view of his conspicuous qualities and his long political experience.His unanimous election to the presidency of this session can only be interpreted as an indication of the high regard in which the friendly and fraternal country of Bangladesh is held by the nations of the world. My delegation's pleasure in this appointment is all the greater in view of the fraternal bonds and ties of friendship  based on mutual respect and constructive co-operation  that exist between our two countries.1 should also like to express our appreciation and gratitude to his predecessor. Ambassador de PiniSs  whose presidency of the fortieth session was a great honor for us. It is self-evident to say that he presided over that session with great competence and dedication  and in a manner which enabled him to merit all our approval and admiration.I must also pay a tribute to the invaluable and constant efforts made by the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and to his well-known sincerity and determination in the service of our Organization in particular  and the international community in general. I take this opportunity to renew our sincere wishes to him of continued good health  so that he can continue to perform his arduous tasks in the best possible manner.During our last session  at which we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations  the city of Geneva witnessed the first summit  after a lapse of some years  between the two super-Powers on 20 November 1985. But despite the high hopes pinned on that meeting it did not achieve sufficient detente or improvement in the international situation in general  and in the arms race in -particular  to restore our confidence and peace of mind about the present and future of mankind. Hence we still harbor feelings of anxiety and apprehension  because the terrible arms race is as fierce as ever and shows no signs of slackening. In addition to the fact that the weapons of mass destruction have not been eliminated from the arsenals  such weapons are certain to destroy our world. In view of the persistence of this situation it is no wonder that life on this planet is subject to the danger of extinction at any moment  whether as the result either of a fit of anger on the part of one side or the other  or of an accidental error by one party. Just as our last session coincided with the first summit conference betweenthe leaders of the two super-Powers  fate has decreed that our present session coincides with the second summit - scheduled to take place in three days in the capital of Iceland - to overcome problems whose settlement could have obviated the need for that meeting.Moscow and Washington's agreement to meet at the highest level raises our hopes  and we trust that the results of the coming meeting on 12 October will not be as disappointing as those of the previous meetings. To be realistic  we hope that it will lead to specific agreements that will put an end  albeit gradually  to the frenetic race to procure the most deadly and destructive weapons  and will also lead to the elimination of the weapons of mass destruction in the arsenals of the two super-Powers.We also hope that the two sides will achieve an agreement to keep outer space free from the arms race  in the hope that it will be a refuge for man if he hasnowhere to turn on earth  though God fee bid that will ever happen. It is absurd to hear some recklessly advocating the militarization of outer space  as though this planet were too small for their destructive tendencies. Humanity faces enough danger to its presence on this planet. If the aim of this frenzied attempt to achieve supremacy over others is to attain sole hegemony over the nations of the world  it would be useful for those suffering under that illusion to realize that the gains earned by the friendship of peoples outweigh the gains earned by brute force. This persistent arms race prompts us to wonder whether humanity has indeed attained such a degree of affluence as to permit some to expend vast sums on this frenetic race. The answer is no.What is undeniable and irrefutable is that many nations of the world are still suffering from poverty  starvation  underdevelopment and disease. Is it not then the duty of those who squander such vast sums on developing the means of destruction and annihilation to channel those funds  or at least some part of them  into the elimination of the hunger  poverty  underdevelopment and disease which afflict millions of people? We hope that the two major Powers will continue their meetings  because we hope that they will achieve important  specific results that would pit an end to their frenetic rivalry in acquiring more weapons of mass destruction  and thus permit them to channel their energies into the service of humanity  and to eliminate their stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.The United Nations  which was created to contribute to the establishment of peace and security all over the world  is called upon to play a greater role in overcoming all impediments and obstacles on the path towards these agreements  so that man everywhere nay enjoy peace of mind about his present and future.My country  the Yemen Arab Republic  cherishes its membership in the Non-Aligned Movement because of its complete and profound belief that  as a developing country  non-alignment is the best approach it can adopt in the face ofall the pressures of international polarization to which  like numerous other States it is subjected. The growing membership of this Movement is confirmation of the magnitude of the growing re coalition on the part of numerous States of the importance of non-alignment as the ideal option for maintaining their independence and national sovereignty  and for averting the danger of polarization.In view of any ambiguity that might obscure the concept of non-alignment  I wish to take this opportunity to assure you that the concept of non-alignment subscribed to by our enlightened leadership under our brother the President  the Secretary-General of the General People's Congress  Colonel Ali Abdallah Salih  is a crystal clear ethical concept of principle. Non-alignment  as a concept and in practice  certainly does not mean neutrality between right and wrong; rather it means standing by what is right and championing it and standing against wrong and resisting it. While on the subject of non-alignment I should like to express my country's satisfaction at the success of the recent summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Harare  the capital of the friendly country of Zimbabwe. That success was one more illustration of the growing role played by the Won-Aligned Movement in supporting our supreme international Organization and its efforts to promote peace and justice in the world and to settle the international and regional disputes which abound in the international community. The success of that Conference also prompts us to praise the exemplary manner in which His Excellency the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe  Mr. Robert Mugabe  presided over the meetings of that Conference  and his constructive contribution to the achievements of the Conference  as reflected in its decisions and recommendations.We would have liked to see the United Nations entering the fifth decade of its long life - God willing - in a world devoid of injustice  tension  and causes of conflict  poverty and hunger; but a cursory look at the globe suffices to cause concern and frustration. However  this does not negate the achievements of the United Nations  reflected in its success in solving some problems that have developed during the past four decades and in championing the right of a number of peoples to determine their own future and win their free dm. But we must also acknowledge its failure to settle a number of crises and problems and to solve many political questions. But it is not fair to lay blame for that on the united Nations alone  because its ability to take effective action is conditional upon the degree of interaction between itself aid international forces  and it derives its strength from the responsiveness of the Member States in general and the major Powers in particular.One of the foremost among the outstanding and perennial questions is that of Palestine and the resulting strife  which has come to be known in the modern political lexicon as the Middle East crisis. Thirty-eight years have elapsed  yet tiie people of Palestine are still deprived of the same right to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on their national soil as that enjoyed by other peoples in the world who have attained their rights and gained their independence.This question has become a perennial item on the agenda of successive sessions of the General Assembly  as well as on the agendas of its subsidiary organs and bodies. The fact that this question has remained without any just solution  despite the innumerable resolutions of this Organization  is categorical proof of the success of some States in robbing the United Nations of its role and of its raison d'etre. I cannot think of any question which is more just and more deserving of concern and settlement than this Question  especially since the rights of the matter are crystal clear. Since the United Nations is unable to redress the blatant injustice inflicted upon the victimized people of Palestine and accepts the aggressor  Israel  as one of its Members  to occupy a seat in this Hall  to run amok challenging its prestige  cynically disregarding its resolutions. It is no wonder that the peoples of the world have lost their confidence in the United Nations and have even come to ridicule its existence. If the Middle East crisis involves continuous strife and is a hotbed of international tension  it is because the Question of Palestine  which  as we have previously declared  is the crux and essence of the strife in the area  is still unresolved.But how can we find the way to a just solution of this Question? How can we find the way to a settlement of the strife in the region based on justice  while Israel persists in its arrogance and aggression  occupying Palestine and the territories of neighboring Arab States  and challenging the United Nations and the whole international community  without shame or scruple? How can we expect Israel to give up its policy of aggression and immature recklessness  and its practice of terrorism  as long as it receives all means of support and encouragement from a major international Power  the United States of America?Unquestionably the fact that the Question of Palestine has remained without a just solution for about four decades is an affront to mankind and proof of the failure of the United Nations to discharge its role and to fulfil its duties. It is no secret that Israel is responsible for the frustration of all the international efforts and endeavors  collectively and individually  designed to settle this just Question.There is near unanimity on the need to convene an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and all parties to the Arab-Israeli strife  but those who are blocking the convening of such a conference  and even reject the idea  are Israel and its ally  the United States. Does anyone need further proof that Israel rejects peace? But if Israel is aspiring to impose the peace of capitulation  it is badly mistaken. And why does it insist on what kind of peace  and reject peace based on justice and right?Be that as it may  the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations  with the the participation of all the parties concerned  foremost among which is the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole legitimate representative of our brothers the Palestinian people  and the five States that are permanent members of the Security Council  remains in our view the proper framework for seeking an appropriate formula to solve the Question of Palestine and the problem of the Middle East  and hence to establish a just and lasting peace in that sensitive part of the world.Perhaps Israel entertains the dream that its occupation of Palestine and the Syrian Golan Heights  and the other parts it still occupies in Lebanon  will with the passage of time become an unchallengeable fait accompli  and thus acquire international legitimacy. If that is so  Israel must remember that Western colonialism  faced with the growing struggle of the peoples  had to depart from a large number of countries after an occupation which had in many cases lasted over a century. Thus  ^he fate of its occupation of the Arab territories  whether Palestine  Lebanon or Syria  will be no better than the fate of Western colonialismIt is high time for our Arab nation to put a prompt and decisive end to its prolonged suffering as a result of the implanting of Israel in the heart of the Arab homeland. The acts of aggression and the crimes committed by the Zionist entity over the past 30 years are more than enough to convince even its fervent partisans  foremost among them the United States of America  of the aggressive nature of this parasitical entity and of its arrogance and folly. But those biased in its favor see its vices as virtues  and its crimes as acts of heroism.The United States  as a major Power  is now called upon to reconsider its position in support of Israel and to review its policy in order to play its role  with other major international Powers  in restoring justice and seeking a just solution to the question of Palestine and the crisis in the Middle East  in order to establish peace and justice. However  no international effort can succeed unless the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are restored and unless the occupied Arab territories are returned to their rightful owners.The Arab States have affirmed the sincerity of their wish to restore a just peace in the region through their proposal reflected in the decisions of the twelfth summit Conference at Fez  and they reiterated their attachment to that proposal at their emergency summit Conference in August of last year.Although that initiative won broad international support  Israel still rejects the establishment of a just and lasting peace  and continues to declare that rejection with arrogance and insolence. But the United Nations should not stand idly by in the face of this intransigent Israeli rejection. The United Nations must intensify its efforts to impose a just and lasting solution so that the area will not remain a hotbed of tension which could burst into flames at any moment.Sufficient proof of the gravity of the continuing crisis in the Middle East is the widening cycle of violence  which has now encroached on other areas. But those who have been up in arms as a result of some individual incidents should study and investigate the causes of the phenomena of individual terrorist acts in order to eradicate this scourge. Because  had it not been for the condoning of Israel's terrorism  which claims the lives of thousands of innocents  the acts of terrorism by groups or individuals claiming the lives of other innocents would not have taken place. We are against terrorism  but resistance to terrorism must also be aimed against Israeli terrorism.Hence  those who condemn individual terrorism only  should also condemn Israeli terrorism  which is practiced against the people of Palestine and Lebanon under the eyes of the whole world. There is no more heinous crime than collective terrorism. It is unacceptable that some parties on the international scene should view terrorism the way an Arab poet describes it: the murder of one person in a jungle is an unforgivable crime  while the murder of an entire people is open to debate. The logic of the double standard is completely unacceptable.Individual terrorism  no matter how heinous  cannot be equated  in terms of either responsibility or results  with the terrorism practiced by a State which  I regret to say  belongs to this and to other international organizations. Putting an end to Israeli terrorism and its occupation of Palestine  Lebanese territories and the Syrian Golan Heights  and the restoration of these territories to their rightful owners  would eradicate the phenomena of individual terrorism  which is considered a natural result of the negation of justice and the prevalence of the law of force  usurpation and aggression.It is truly regrettable that the beginning of our current session coincides with the seventh year of the long and bloody war between Iraq and Iran. This is a costly war. Thousands upon thousands have fallen in this war  to the point where its victims have exceeded one million. Numerous installations in both countries have been destroyed  and much of the infrastructure has also been destroyed. The Yemen Arab Republic  which has consistently called for an end to the bloodshed  sees this raging wac as a wanton absurdity and a depletion of the capabilities of two peoples to whom we have been bound by ties of religion and good-neighborliness since ancient times. We appreciate the endeavors of the Secretary-General  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  and the Non-aligned Movement  and welcomed the initiative of Iraq last August and its readiness to accept a cease-fire. We therefore hope that Iran  for its part  will adopt a positive attitude by responding to that initiative and accepting the offers of mediation  because these continued hostilities threaten the entire area and are jeopardizing international peace and security.The world should not stand idly by watching this bloody human tragedy. Hence we call upon the major Powers  and those in a position to do so  to play their role in putting an end to this destructive war before its sparks fly out in all directions to start a greater and more destructive fire.Putting an end to this tragic war calls for the observance by the belligerents of an immediate cease-fire  the withdrawal of all forces to the internationally recognized boundaries and the holding of direct negotiations that would preserve the legitimate rights of each  in accordance with the rules of international law. Hence  Iran must express its readiness to agree to this and to follow the example of Iraq.As regards the problem of Afghanistan  which remains unchanged  the Yemen Arab Republic  while welcoming the declaration by the Soviet Union of its intention to withdraw seven of its battalions from Afghanistan before the end of the year  supports all international efforts and endeavors directed to achieving a peaceful solution to this problem through negotiation among the parties concerned  with a view to enabling the Afghan people to exercise its right to sovereignty and to the choice of its own social and economic system free from all external pressures. We feel that any approach to solving this problem must provide for the need for the refugees return to their homes as soon as possible  and the cessation of all forms of foreign intervention. While the problem of Cyprus still remains unresolved because of the difficulties encountered during the negotiations between the representatives of the two communities  it demands a redoubling of the international effort by the United Nations and an intensification of its endeavors to guarantee a continued dialog between the two parties to the dispute  because dialog is the optimum means of achieving a satisfactory settlement which guarantees for all freedom of religion and coexistence on the basis of equality of rights and duties within a single independent Cyprus.In Africa  the occupation of Namibia by the racist regime of Pretoria is another grave challenge to the international community. Despite the numerous decisive resolutions adopted by the United Nations  the Pretoria regime arrogantly rejects them all  and insists on continuing its usurpation of this Territory.Paced with this intransigent rejection by the racist regime  we must increase our support for the people of Namibia  under the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  its sole legitimate representative. This calls for increased pressure by the international community to break the vicious circle of this perennial problem by putting an end to the occupation of the territory by the racist regime of South Africa.The actions and crimes of the racist rigime against the Namibians and their militant leadership violate the most fundamental human rights and all the resolutions of the Organization in general  and Security Councilresolution 435 (1978) in particular. Unless these resolutions are implemented  the Namibian people will remain a victim of the most heinous form of aggression  oppression and injustice practiced against it by the racist regime of South Africa. Despite the continued condemnation by the international community of the practices of that odious regime  the mere presence of which is considered an affront to humanity  it still persists in defying world public opinion and allresolutions of the United Nations and other organizations  and in continuing its flagrant violations of all international laws and norms.In southern Africa itself  the same regime is still practicing the hideous policy of apartheid  using all forms of humiliation  torture and oppression to deny the indigenous majority all its rights and to maintain its domination by oppressing the heroic resistance.It is no wonder that this regime has no other ally or champion but Israel  since birds of a feather flock together. Both regimes are not only alien  but also have a racist and fascist doctrine. This binds them in an unholy alliance of collaboration far removed from ethics  honor and all other fundamental values and norms. It does not surprise us that Israel sides with the racist regime of South Africa  but we are surprised to see it getting support from States which pay lip service to freedom and consider themselves the champions of human rights. But why should we feel surprised when those same States also support Israel  the first ally of the Pretoria regime  and its counterpart?With respect to Korea  my delegation would like to express its satisfaction at the desire of the Korean people in North and South Korea for reunification  and hopes that this lofty aim will be achieved peacefully and democratically  free from all external pressure or influence.While my country feels highly gratified at the restoration of democracy in some Latin American countries  it is following with great concern the news about the armed clashes currently taking place in Central America. But we are firmly convinced that the solution to these problems lies in resort by the parties concerned to dialog and peaceful means to arrive at a formula that will guarantee to each people in the area the right of self-determination and the right to choose its own regime without any foreign pressure.The feet that the structure of current international economic relations remain unchanged  despite the obvious injustice it entails for the developing countries  will remain a major cause of tension in our world  because it has a continuing effect in widening the gap between developing and developed countries. This is because the latter regard the former as cheap sources of raw materials and as open markets for their manufacturers  instead of regarding them  as they should  as their partners in complementarity. The absence of the necessary equal footing between the two sides can lead only to more poverty for the poor and greater wealth for the rich.In addition to the dangers inherent in the unjust international economic situation  the proliferation of adverse phenomena in the world economy  such as fluctuating currency exchange rates  the decline in commodity prices  the establishment of tariff and non-tariff barriers against exports from the developing countries  and the hampering of the transfer of technology from the industrial to the developing countries have all been exacerbating the economic crisis faced by many developing countries. While that has already been demonstrated by the depression and stagnation in international trade  the difficulties and pressures being endured by some countries burdened with debt  and in the faltering development plans in many third world countries  resulting in a decline ir  their social and economic growth rates  could  if the situation continues  lead to even more serious consequences. Unless the countries of the North are sufficiently responsive in their dialog with the countries of the South and make some of the concessions needed from then  the world may suffer an economic catastrophe whose effects will not be confined to the developing countries but will inevitably spread to the industrial countries  and be reflected in the stagnation of their industries  depressed markets for their products and the deterioration of their economies.In order to improve the quality of life in our world  there must be an absence of all forms of exploitation from international economic relations  so that there is an international economic order based on justice  interdependence  and complementarity  because the injustice suffered by the developing countries in their dealings with the developed countries will adversely affect all peoples  which in turn would lead to the emergence of political problems that would reduce many parts of the world to chaos. Political coexistence among the various nations of the world calls for the establishment of healthy relations among them on the basis of economic interdependence and complementarity  if not on a unity ofAny hope for the recovery of the world economy will remain an illusion unless confidence is restored in the relations among the various parties. Moreover the wealth with which some States in the world are endowed  or which they gained in the past while other peoples were slumbering  and which has provided the basis of their growth and development  should not be the source of happiness for the few and misery for the many  if mankind is not to remain for ever divided between rich and poor. My country's choice of the democratic approach represents a final and irreversible decision. The general elections held a few weeks ago to broaden the base of the General People's Congress and the subsequent election of the members of the Standing Committee of that Congress by the representatives of the popular electoral base in full freedom and integrity  as acknowledged by both citizens and observers  was an affirmation of the determination of our national leadership  headed by our President  the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and the Secretary-General of the General People's Congress  Colonel Ali Abdullah Saleh  toThe unity of Yemen is the loftiest objective of our peoples  and our national leadership loses no opportunity of affirming its commitment to that objective. We are still working with our brothers in the southern part of Yemen in order to achieve that objective as soon as possible.Finally  I renew my call to the United Nations to redouble its efforts to solve all problems and questions  foremost among which are the questions of Palestine  the Middle East  South Africa and Namibia  so that they do not remain perennial items on the agenda of successive sessions of the General Assembly  as has been the case for years - nay  for decades - thereby making it possible for the Organization to regain its prestige and capability in the eyes of all peoples and nations.I pray that God may grant guidance and success to the Assembly in the performance of its task."
"146",7549,"YUG",41,1986,"I should like to extend to you. Sir  warmest congratulations on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly. It is indeed a great pleasure to greet in this high office the representative of Bangladesh  a country to which we are linked by bonds of friendship  joint commitment to the policy of non-alignment  and mutual and broader co-operation.I should also like to express my appreciation to Mr. Jaime de Pini£s  a distinguished representative of friendly Spain  for his successful conduct of the deliberations of the fortieth anniversary session of the General Assembly.Our appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his continued efforts to solve international problems and  in particular  his endeavors to preserve and strengthen the role of the United Nations at this critical juncture for our Organization and for multilateral co-operation in general.The anniversary session of the General Assembly last year provided the right opportunity for us to ask ourselves what we had done in the past 40 years to implement the objectives we had set before ourselves in creating the UnitedNations. Our joint assessment was that the world had undergone enormous changes in the past 40 years  that progress had been achieved in all areas of mankind's development  and that a vital contribution had been made by the United Nations.Together we assessed that we still owed a great debt to those aspirations of the world enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations more than 40 years ago. They are aspirations for a world free for all; a peace lasting and secure for all; a world in which the differences in development would be diminished and the progress of all would be ensured; a world without divisions into blocs; a world in which we should all bear in mind that we share a common present and future  and that it is only by joint efforts that we can make them better.In the anniversary year we proclaimed 1986 the International Year of Peace. We are faced with the question: What have we done this year to bring about peace? What steps have been taken and what steps could or should we have taken to move with greater confidence along the road leading to lasting peace?All the dangers  contradictions and conflicts that have plagued the world for years still prevail and threaten our very survival. The values and achievements that we have patiently built up through joint endeavors in the struggle for peace  security and equitable international cooperation are threatened today  perhaps more than ever before. Confrontations  the arms race  crises  the spread of poverty and the underdevelopment of a large part of humanity  the attempts made by some of the most powerful countries to resolve global political and economic problems  denials and efforts to push aside the achievements and emancipation of peoples and countries: all these things bring home the bitter truth of the world in which we live.Is it possible to say that we have taken a step towards peace this year even though nothing has been done at least to start eliminating the causes of the crises in southern Africa  the Near and Middle Bast  South-west and South-East Asia  and Central America; while the problems of Cyprus and the reunification of Korea remain unresolved; and while new tensions  demonstrations of force and the use of force and dangers for peace emerge as is the case in the Mediterranean?A just and lasting solution of these crises calls for renunciation of the policy of fait accompli and of the positions acquired by force  withdrawal of occupation forces  the cessation of all intervention and interference in internal affairs and  above all  the exercise by peoples of the right to self-determination  independence and free development.However  there were certain developments in this International Year of Peace that raise hope and call for further efforts. The representatives of 100 non-aligned countries have come here from their summit conference in Harare  from a large meeting of peace and co-operation  resolved to make a contribution to the relaxation of tension-and the renewal of detente  disarmament  the overcoming of crises  and the quest for solutions to development problems.The summit Conference worked out a Program for the involvement of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in the struggle for peace and development. It took clear positions  launched initiatives and called for co-operation in the resolution of international problems. The decisions of the eighth summit Conference are a reflection of the determination of non-aligned countries to continue and strengthen their involvement.This year has also seen a continuation of the dialog between the two super-Powers. We still expect it to bring about concrete results. There is a widespread readiness in the world to support and make a contribution to the success of that dialog. However  there is an impression that mutual mistrust and rivalry are so deeply rooted that it is difficult to turn away from confrontation and towards negotiation and agreement. The ""/orId is plagued by continuous uncertainty as to whether the orientation towards dialog and negotiations will survive  whether the progress that is being made will be maintained. It lives in fear that the fate of peace  co-operation and development will become lost in the maze of negative tactical moves. All experience shows that negotiations bear fruit only if they are directed towards solving problems. After all  that is what negotiations are all about.It is encouraging that in the year between two Assembly sessions a number of proposals and initiatives have emerged  aimed at halting the arms race and reducing and eliminating nuclear or conventional arms  which constitute a realistic basis for fruitful negotiations. Further  it is encouraging that the first stage of the Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe was successfully completed. That is telling proof of the vital interest of all European countries in co-operation and in overcoming bloc barriers. Europe has no alternative but to strengthen understanding and co-operation. The craning follow-up meeting in Vienna to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will provide an opportunity and impose an obligation to continue along this road  in the interest not only of Europe  but of all.From their meeting in Harare the non-aligned countries addressed an appeal to the super-Powers to undertake urgent measures to prevent the outbreak of nuclear war  to discontinue confrontation and conflicts and to move along the road of dialog with a view to bringing about the cessation of the arms race and reaching substantive agreements in the field of disarmament  including an immediate nuclear test ban and early agreement on preventing the arms race in space.Last year  at their summit meeting in Geneva  the United States and the Soviet Onion committed themselves before the world to accelerating the negotiations  with the following aims""to prevent an arms race in space and to terminate it on earth  to limit and reduce nuclear arms and enhance strategic stability"". (A/40/1070  p. 3) The world is expecting decisive steps. It supports every effort of the two super-Powers leading in that direction. te hope that another summit meeting between the Soviet Union and the United States will take place and that it will make a concrete contribution to the process of relaxation of tension and disarmament.The summit Conference of non-aligned countries in Harare and the recently concluded special session of the General Assembly on Namibia reminded us once again how much we owe it to the peoples of southern Africa to remove the vestiges of a dark past. Nowhere in the world today are human rights  fundamental freedoms and human dignity so ruthlessly suppressed as in South Africa and occupied Namibia by the apartheid regime.The international community has only one choice: either to accept a situation in which mass bloodshed is unavoidable and of which the proportions and the final outcome are unforeseeable or to resort without delay to the last available peaceful means - the imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The appeal of the non-aligned countries from Harare was addressed primarily to those that still hesitate to join in the general request for the imposition of sanctions. The opposition to sanctions cannot be justified by alleged concern that their consequences would affect the black population of South Africa. After all  no curse is worse for them than apartheid. The people of South Africa and Namibia ask to be saved not from sanctions but from racial discrimination  lawlessness and slavery.It is Illusion to think that by opposing sanctions the narrow interests of individual countries in southern Africa can be preserved. They will be consumed by the fire set by apartheid. Only a southern Africa rid of apartheid and colonialism can open vistas for co-operation  which is possible only between free countries and peoples and in which everybody can find  preserve and realize his interests.The continuation of the crisis in international economic relations and its ever more difficult consequences for developing countries make it incumbent upon our General Assembly not only to devote greater attention to these problems but also to initiate the necessary action. International co-operation in solving the economic problems of the world is in crisis. In the absence of dialog between North and South  the differences in the level of development may grow into political divisions and confrontations. In disarray and mutually confronted  guided by narrow interests  we shall not curb negative trends in world economic relations and development.The developing countries are exposed to the devastating consequences of factors over which they have almost no influence. One of the most difficult problems besetting them is that of debt. At the same time this is one of the most pressing political  economic and financial problems world wide. Debt has become a means of extracting enormous profits from developing countries. Objectively  it maintains and deepens the differences in development. In the 1981-1985 period alone  the developing countries paid the developed ones about $US 340 billion in interest payments; none the less their overall debt increased by a further $us 300 billion. The postponement of a genuine solution obviously only exacerbates the problem of debt. It was therefore high time to include this issue as a separate item in the agenda of the General Assembly.He expect the General Assembly to take positions which will guide all the institutions within the United Nations system that are directly and concretely dealing with these problems. Me are deeply convinced that it is necessary to proceed  first and foremost  from the need to ensure a stable and accelerated development of debtor coin tries  alleviate the conditions for the service of debts to the maximum extent  and launch a process of a genuine solution of interrelated issues of money  finance  debt  trade and raw materials.The recent Eighth Submit Conference of Non-aligned Countries in Harare has confirmed once again that the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries remains consistent in its independent orientation  authentic principles  and the goals it opted for at its First Summit Conference in Belgrade twenty-five years ago.In the positions the Harare Summit has taken  the policy of non-alignment is yet again asserted as a factor in the relaxation of tension and in active and peaceful co-existence. It was and remains a force deeply committed to the overcoming of confrontation and the strengthening of co-operation. Naturally  it has resolutely opposed and continues to oppose each and every threat to peace  freedom  equality  independence and a free development of all countries  not because it seeks confrontation  but rather because it seeks to remove from international relations all causes of confrontation and threats to peace and the free development of all countries.The Movement aspires to overcome the bloc and all other divisions in the world which lead to confrontation and impede the progress of the world and its overall relations. The Movement can evaluate the policy of any country only on the basis of its substance  on the strength of its contribution  at each particular moment  and on each specific question  to peace  cooperation  equality  relaxation of international tensions  disarmament  unhampered development of all countries  over cosing of differences in development and co-operation between North and South. After all  the value of a specific policy can only be measured against deeds.The united Nations is the best expression of one of the greatest achievements in the development of international relations: equitable participation of all countries in the solution of questions that concern the destiny of the whole world. We must safeguard and promote this achievement. We  therefore  do not accept the attempts to determine the rights of the United Nations Mergers according to their might and wealth.We do not close our eyes to the shortcomings of the world Organization. What we need is common concern and joint efforts to eliminate them. We have already taken the initial steps and we should continue along these lines.The United Nations was created and can survive only as an organization of independent and sovereign States  acting on an equitable basis in the quest for a better world today and a better tomorrow.The world has long been living between confrontation and co-operation  conflicts aid accommodation  mistrust and understanding. we live in a world beset by deep-rooted divisions; however  we all live in this one and only world. Without faith in our common survival and progress  without mutual understanding  we are all equally threatened  what has been said so far from this rostrum strengthens our hopes that we can and must confront resolutely the legacy of the past and the challenges of the present  and build a future with shared responsibility for our common destiny."
"147",7613,"ZMB",41,1986,"When I addressed the Assembly on 17 September 1986  as we met in special session to review the question of Namibia  I had the opportunity to congratulate the President on his well-deserved election to his post for the forty-first session. My delegation is delighted to note that he is guiding our deliberations with great skill. May his stewardship bring about a successful conclusion of our work.Last year we commemorated the fortieth anniversary of our Organization. At that session  we all reaffirmed our hope and faith in the United Nations. We are meeting again today to continue our collective efforts to find solutions to the problems facing us.Regrettably  since our last regular session there has been very little we can point to in the direction of progress that we have achieved in resolving the many problems facing mankind today. On the economic front  third-world nations continue to face very critical economic problems  including the pressure of crushing external debt and lack of real growth in their economies.On the political side  the threat of nuclear catastrophe continues to threaten the world  while regional profeJoms in southern Africa  the Gulf  Central America  the Middle East  Korea  Cyprus  Afghanistan and Kampuchea remain unresolved.The world faces a number of economic challenges. In the developing world  and especially Africa  economic prosperity remains an unattainable and distant goal for the majority of the country. Instead of moving forward  the economies of many countries are either stagnant or actually declining. This situation has been brought about by both inappropriate domestic policies and the current unfavorable international economic order Happily  an increasing number of African countries  including my own  are taking the hard steps required to reorient their economies towards increased productivity and eventual growth.The holding  earlier this year  of a united Nations General Assembly special session on the critical economic situation in Africa testified to the determination of the nations of Africa to address their economic problems. Yet  despite the efforts that we ourselves are making to deal with our economic difficulties  these problems will not disappear until the nations of the world have been able to resolve the central issue of the relations between the nations of the rich North and the poor countries of the South. The existing international economic order is clearly exploitative and contributes a great deal to the economic problems we are facing in the third world.Our countries continue to be essentially producers of primary commodities. Under the existing international economic order  the prices of these commodities are invariably fixed by the rich North  which provides the markets. The nations of the North have also the benefit of fixing the prices of their own products which they sail to us. Since the prices of primary products invariably remain lower than those of industrial products  we have a situation in which net real resources are flowing from the poor nations to the rich instead of the other way round. When one also bears in mind the flow of invisibles from the poor nations to the rich  the situation is clearly desperate  requiring urgent action by the international community.Since we are unable to receive fair prices for what we export  we are forced to borrow in order to finance our development plans. The result is that debt servicing has now become a serious constraint on our development efforts. In order  therefore  to give real meaning to our reform of domestic policy  it is necessary that the international community take urgent measures to reduce the impact of debt servicing cm our economies.At the same time  fresh efforts should be made to bring about the establishment of a new international economic order. The reluctance by the industrialized countries to agree to the establishment of a new order is clearly intended to continue the present system in which the poor are exploited to enrich those who are already rich.The international political situation remains equally unsatisfactory. The specter of nuclear war overhangs the world as the nuclear race continues unabated and threatens to extend to outer space. The world power blocs continue to develop new and more powerful weapons of mass destruction despite the fact that existing stockpiles of weapons are already at levels that cannot be justified by any rational military purpose. We remain convinced that the survival of mankind cannot be guaranteed until real progress is made towards disarmament under effective international control. We believe that the first step in this process is the freezing of the development  testing  production and stockpiling of additional weapons. In this respect  we welcome the efforts being made by the Wiited States and the Soviet Union to reach agreement on limiting nuclear weapons.The situation in southern Africa continues to pose a serious threat not only to regional security and peace but also to international peace and security. The major problems that bedevil our region are three: the continuation of apartheid in South Africa  the illegal occupation of Namibia by racist South Africa and South Africa's policy of destabilization against the independent African States in the region.This Assembly is familiar with the nature of apartheid. It is a policy or system under which the white minority regime of South Africa retains in its hands all political  economic  military  scientific and social power to the exclusion of the black majority and uses that power to carry out a most extraordinary and systematic program of exploitation and dehumanization of the black majority comparable only to slave trade and Nazism. It is noteworthy that the perpetrators of this system were supporters of Nazi Germany during the last war. Indeed  as Nazism was being defeated in Europe  it was already beginning to re-emerge in South Africa.The black people of South Africa have made every effort to end apartheid peacefully. For close to 50 years they carried out their protest against white minority rule peacefully. Regrettably  this peaceful effort was entirely fruitless and resulted only in the intensification of apartheid.The independent African countries of the region have also made concerted efforts to bring about a peaceful end to apartheid. Some of our countries have met with the leaders of South Africa and have also signed agreements with them with the aim of bringing about peace in our region. Regrettably again  these efforts have failed  and they have failed only because racist South Africa remains committed to racism and apartheid. Finally  the international community has made efforts to assist South Africa to abandon apartheid. The latest of these efforts were made by the Commonwealth and the European Economic Community missions to South Africa. Those  too  failed  and for the same reasons. Last week discussed the question of Namibia. As we saw  efforts to bring Namibia to independence have stalled because of the extraneous conditions demanded by the United States and apartheid South Africa.I have deliberately gone into these details to show that the African people of South Africa and the independent African States of the region have made every effort to bring peace to southern Africa. We cannot  therefore  be blamed for the increase in tension that has occurred.Instead of responding favorably to those efforts. South Africa has intensified repression of its black majority  especially under successive states of emergency. Moreover  South Africa has refused to allow Namibia to accede to independence and has instead mounted a campaign of destabilization against its neighbors. That campaign consists of a number of co-ordinated elements! the destruction of our transport infrastructure in the vain hope that having to depend on South Africa will cause the African States to support apartheid; military attacks such as those on Angola  Botswana  Zambia and Zimbabwe; the promotion of bandits in our countries; economic blockades such as the one against these other economic sanctions such as those recently applied against Zambia and Zimbabwe; and a variety of threats.Because racist South Africa has refused to abandon apartheid  the black independent nations of southern Africa  the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the Commonwealth  the Non-Aligned Movement and the international community in general have called for the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa  these being the most peaceful instrument of persuasion now available  all else having failed.Sadly  these  too  have been effectively blocked by the vetoes of the united States and Britain. Even the efforts of the European Economic Community have been effectively diluted by Britain and the Federal Republic-of Germany. Clearly this support encouraged and strengthened the racist regime in its persistent maintenance of apartheid.We can find no reason why the United States and Britain  which fought and defeated Nazism barely 40 years ago  now find themselves firmly on the side of apartheid  other than their own racism  economic interests and misguided ideological considerations.We again call on the United States and Britain to unblock the international process for peace. Unless that is done  the black people of South Africa and Namibia will have no alternative but to look to themselves to bring about the end of apartheid and the independence of Namibia. Were this to happen  there could no peace anywhere in the region  and that for a long time. The major Western countries would not be able to escape their responsibility.We also call on South Africa to take the steps necessary to bring about negotiations and peace. In particular  we call on South Africa to declare apartheid null and void  lift the state of emergency in all areas and eliminate all the draconian laws  lift the ban on the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC)  the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) and other political organizations  release unconditionally Nelson Mandela and all the other political prisoners still in jail or detention and establish a dialog on the future of the country between Government leaders and the genuine and authentic leaders of the African people.Another area of great concern to us is the Gulf region. Since the Gulf war started six years ago the loss of life and property on both sides has been considerable. In 1981-1983 Zambia joined Cuba  India and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in a Committee of Four appointed by the Non-Aligned Movement to mediate in the war. That effort  like others  failed. Recently  at the Non-Aligned summit in Harare  Zambia again called for an end to the war. While Iraq has shown willingness to end the war by negotiation  Iran  regrettably  has shown no flexibility whatsoever  insisting that the war be ended on the battlefield.The international community cannot allow this needless war to continue indefinitely. The United Nations Charter provides the means to intervene in a situation where international peace and security are threatened. In our view  such a situation exists today in the Gulf.Moreover  the two countries involved are both members of the Non-Aligned Movement. The continuation of the war not only weakens the two countries concerned but also affects the well-being of the Movement. For these reasons  we in Zambia believe that the peace plan proposed by Iraq offers the best chance of resolving the conflict. As the Assembly is aware  the Iraqi peace plan involves the following broad elements  the general  complete and unconditional withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized borders  a general and complete exchange of prisoners  the signing of a peace and non-aggression agreement between Iran and Iraq  non-interference by either country in the internal affairs of the other country  respect by each country for the choices of the other  and the commitment of each country to all efforts aimed at achieving stability and security in the Gulf area.Zambia believes that if those elements are accepted  they will provide a basis for moving forward towards peace in the area.The conflict in the Middle East continues to be another source of concern. As we have stated before  the core of the Middle East problem is the question of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in an independent. State of their own. Israel's refusal to concede that right  its acts of aggression against its neighbor s and its continued occupation of Arab lands only serve to compound the problem. We call upon Israel to concede the right of the Palestinian people to their own independent State and to desist from acts of aggression against its neighbors. We remain convinced that a just solution of the Middle East problem is still possible within the framework of the United Nations.The situation in Central America continues to worsen despite the efforts of the Contadora Group to bring about peace  we commend the efforts of the Contadora countries and the Support Group aimed at bringing peace to the region. We are  however  concerned that Central America is turning into an arena for East-West rivalry. We feel strongly that those outside Central America should respect the sovereignty  national independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned character of the Central American States.The continuing conflicts and tensions in Afghanistan and Kampuchea are also of great concern to us. We believe that the solution to these problems lies in political settlements based on the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from these countries and on respect for the sovereignty  national independence and territorial integrity of both countries. We believe that the people of these countries should be given an opportunity to choose their own economic  political and social systems without outside interference.In the Korean peninsula  Zambia supports the desire of the Korean people to reunify their country through peaceful negotiations. Finally  Zambia supports the independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Cyprus. We are anxious to see a lasting solution to the conflict in that divided community. For this reason  we support the efforts of the Secretary-General to bring unity to the island.In concluding my statement  let me again stress the urgency of the racial crisis unfolding in southern Africa. The United Nations can play a meaningful role in bringing about the peaceful elimination of apartheid in South Africa and independence for Namibia  but only if it is allowed to do so by the major nations of the West. We ourselves stand ready to play our part. But if the major nations of the West continue to support apartheid by blocking all peaceful efforts to end it  the oppressed people have a right  nay  a duty  to rid their country of apartheid by all the means at their disposal  including armed struggle. If this is what they have to do  the loss in human life and property will be incalculable. This loss is unnecessary and can be prevented. Does the West have the will to prevent the unfolding catastrophe?"
"148",7647,"ZWE",41,1986," I should like to preface my statement by discharging some special and pleasant duties.First  Sir  on my own behalf and on behalf of my entire delegation  I wish to offer you our heartiest congratulations on your richly deserved unanimous election to preside over the forty-first session of this Assembly. Your own distinguished record as a skilled and experienced diplomat gives us justified confidence that under your guidance this Assembly will deal successfully with its long agenda. I pledge the maximum co-operation of the Zimbabwe delegation to you in your efforts to guide the Assembly to even greater achievements.Your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Jaime de Pinies  is equally deserving of our tribute for the able manner in which he discharged the duties of his office and we heartily thank him.I am pleased  Mr. President  to see seabed on your side our Secretary-General  my friend Mr. Perez de Cuellar  who  as I have learned  is rapidly recuperating from his recent illness. As we all also know  despite problems with his health  the Secretary-General paid full attention to the well-being of the Organization  as is ampLy illustrated by his analytical repeat for this year.I should begin by noting that the long list of issues on the agenda of this session is truly reflective of the burning and pressing concerns of the international community. In many ways the questions before this Assembly are quite similar to those on the agenda of the recently concluded eighth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held in Harare from 1 to 6 September 1986. I shall crave the Assembly's indulgence to refer in my statement to some of the important decisions and pronouncements of that historic summit meeting over which I was singularly honored to preside.Since the adoption on 14 December 1960 by this Assembly of the epoch-making Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Com tries and People's  resolution 1514 (XV)  no less than 60 countries and many millions of people have successfully broken their colonial shackles and are now occupying their rightful places in the Assembly and other international forums. While the Harare Summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries noted this impressive record with satisfaction and gratification  the leaders also expressed themselves as equally disturbed and disconcerted that the people of Namibia  New Caledonia  Micronesia and other dependent Territories continue to endure colonial domination and exploitation. Both the 1960 Declaration and elementary justice and morality demand that they be granted the right to shape their own destinies.The question of Namibian independence  end in particular the refusal by the South African apartheid regime to grant that independence despite all the clear and unequivocal decisions and resolutions of the Assembly  constitutes nothing less than a scandal. I do not propose to discuss this issue in any detail  having regard to the recently concluded special session of the Assembly  which yet again addressed it fully. I merely wish to reiterate the following aspects: the United Nations  through its Council for Namibia  is the legal administering authority until such time as Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is implemented and Namibia is free and independent. The racist Pretoria regime is illegally occupying Namibia by military force and entirely against the wishes and aspirations of the Namibian people. Even as we are gathered here  the racist occupation forces are not only exploiting that Territory and its people  they are also massively militarizing Namibia into a formidable launching pad for aggressive acts of State terrorism and military destabilization against neighboring States  especially Angola. In this connection  this Assembly must  as did the recent Harare eighth Summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries  condemn strongly the Pretoria regime for this and for recruiting  training  financing  directing and infiltrating bandits and mercenary elements into neighboring countries to destabilize and overthrow their Governments.Equally unacceptable to and condemned by us are the policies of linkage  whereby the independence of Namibia is  in effect  made conditional upon the exit of Cuban troops from neighboring Angola.Our fears that the United States policy of constructive engagement was not in the interests of peace in our region were later justified by that Government's decision to resort to the arming  equipping and financing of Jonah Savimbi's counter-revolutionaries and bandits for the purpose of overthrowing the legitimate Government of the People's Republic of Angola. This action  which clearly is State terrorism  must surely have the effect of undermining the possibility of a quick and peaceful resolution of the conflicts in our region. What is very urgently required is not criminal collaboration with the murderous Pretoria regime  which is already on the warpath  but the acceleration of its isolation until it offers unconditional co-operation with United Nations efforts to implement resolution 435 (1978) for the independence of Namibia.Southern Africa is a region truly in crisis. The root cause of conflict in the region is obviously the apartheid system which  according to the eighth Summit Conference of $ton-Aligned Countries  has already jeopardized the sub-continent's peace and security and is threatening international peace and security as well. Only positive and concerted action by the whole international community  not pious resolutions  will break the obduracy of the apartheid regime. The same international oo ran unity which has declared apartheid a crime against humanity and an affront to universal conscience must also take concrete action against this international monster.The Assembly must laid weight to the call already made by the Organization of African unity (OAU)  the Non-Aligned Movement  and recently by the International Conference on Sanctions against Racist South Africa  held in Paris from 16 to 20 June 1986 for the immediate imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the Pretoria regime. But pending the imposition of comprehensive mandatory sanctions by the Security Council  I wish to commend for the serious consideration of the Assembly the following package of measures endorsed by the recent eighth Summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries  which includes  but is not limited to  the prohibition of the transfer of technology to South Africa; cessation of export  sale or transport of oil and oil products to South Africa  and of any co-operation with South Africa's oil industry  cessation of further investment in and financial loans to South Africa or Namibia  and of any governmental insurance or guarantee of credits to the regime; prohibition of imports from South Africa of agricultural products  coal  uranium and other mineral commodities; enactment of legislation  or adoption of other measures to comply with United Nations Decree No. 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia enacted by the United Nations Council for Namibia in 1974; termination of air and shipping links with South Africa*  cessation of all academic  cultural  scientific and sports relations with South Africa and of relations with individuals  institutions and other bodies endorsing  or based an  apartheid.Equally disturbing to the international community is the situation in the Middle East  at the core of which is the question of Palestine. Since they were deprived of their land and were callously dispersed in a heart-rending diaspora  the Palestinians have been hounded and even massacred at the hands of Israel and its agents  yet their fighting spirit of resistance continues to rise and soar from the ruins and ashes of enemy brutality and destruction.No Middle East settlement can be just and comprehensive unless it is based on Israel's total and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Palestinian and Arab lands  followed by the full restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians. These rights include the right to unimpeded return to their homeland  the right to self-determination and the right to establish their own independent and sovereign State in their own territory. In this regard the idea of an international conference on peace in the Middle East that would include the PIO as a full participant must be pursued with vigor.Many speakers have already referred in detail to other hotbeds of tension and conflict characterizing the world scene today. I think it is a frightening observation that  at a time when these persistent regional conflicts are threatening to erupt into a conflagration of global dimensions  faith in multilateralism as a central and effective median ism for resolving international tensions and conflicts by peaceful means is on the retreat.I should like to suggest very strongly that this is the time to intensify and reaffirm our commitment to such principles of the United Nations Charter as non-interference in the affairs of sovereign States  respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other States and the inadmissibility of the threat or use of force in settling international disputes and crises.loss of faith in the efficacy of those fundamental principles of multilateralism was responsible for the beginning aid perpetuation of the dangerous situations in Kampuchea and Afghanistan  the tragic Iran-Iraq conflict and the situations in Central America  including Nicaragua  the Korean peninsula  Western Sahara  and the Mediterranean region  including Libya and Cyprus. In all these situations we demand that recourse to the theory and practice of ""might is right""  which can never be justified  be abandoned  for it negates the principles of the Charter and imperils international peace and security.In the same vein  I wish to coax end for its good work the Group of High Level Intergovernmental Experts established by the General Assembly at its fortieth session in accordance with its resolution 40/237 to review the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations. The Group's observations  analyses and recommendation as contained in its report  which is submitted to the Assembly as document A/41/49  are a realistic attempt to find solutions to the problems besetting our Organization  and I sincerely trust that the Assembly will see that in that serious light.The world economic scene is just as gray and critical as the international political scene. For the third world in general the international economic environment has been terribly unfavorable  and for Africa in particular it has been and continues to be disastrous. We are all familiar with the problems of high interest rates  fluctuating commodity prices  the crushing debt burden said the very low levels of external concessional assistance. To these we must also add the devastating effects of such natural disasters as drought and the encroachment of the deserts  which not only threaten the viability of our agricultural sector but also Bake economic recovery even acre difficult.African Governments and peoples are becoming increasingly aware that they more than anybody else just play a major role in their continent's economic regeneration. They are aware of their responsibility to effect and ensure the success of painful structural adjustment measures which aay not be without serious political and social consequences. However  there can be no denying that unless our efforts are generously supported and complemented by the international community  and especially the industrialized countries  Africa's economic recovery  growth and development prospects will continue to be remote. This position was Bade clear in the Africa Priority Program for Economic Recovery  submitted to the Assembly at its special session earlier this year on the critical economic situation in Africa.The economies of African countries are of course an integral part of the world economy. Moreover  most of the economic problems confronting the African countries are also shared by the majority of third-world countries in Asia  Latin America and Oceania. That is why the Heads of state or Government of non-aligned countries paid attention to those problems during the recent Harare Conference. The non-aligned leaders rightly observed that the persistent world economic or is is underlying the importance of fundamental structural adjustments in international economic relations in order to create a just and equitable economic system promoting rapid and sustained economic growth and development throughout the world  especially in the developing countries.It is now time that we reaffirmed our commitment to  and reiterated the continuing validity and relevance of  the Declaration and program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic order as enshrined in General Assembly resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)  of 1 May 1974  as well as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  in General Assembly resolution 3281 (XXIX)  of 12 December 1974  The lack of progress in the implementation of these and similar resolutions  despite the flexible and constructive attitude adopted by the developing countries  is deplorable. The Group of 77 must be commended for its tremendous efforts aimed at stimulating the stalled process of international negotiations through the implementation of the proposals of the seventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which include the launching of global negotiations in two phases: first  a program of immediate measures in areas of critical importance to developing countries  including the International Conference on Money and Finance for Development  and  secondly  a comprehensive reform of the existing inadequate  inscrutable and outdated international monetary and financial system.He cannot but regret the fact that no progress has been made in the implementation of those  proposals  thanks to the intransigent positions adopted by some developed countries. This Assembly should stress the urgent need for the implementation of the program of immediate measures for the reactivation of the world economy.For our part  we in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries have requested the Group of 77 to continue its efforts to reactivate negotiations for the launching of global negotiations as soon as possible. He urge reciprocity and a demonstration of the necessary political will on the part of the developed countries to enable negotiations to be launched. These negotiations  in our view  should be of a global character and should be conducted within the framework of the united Nations.At its fortieth session this Assembly  by its resolution 40/3  proclaimed 1986 the International Year of Peace. That proclamation was specially designed to provide all the people of the world  through their Governments  intergovernmental organizations  non-governmental organizations and as individuals  with a special opportunity to think about and do everything possible for the promotion of world peace.This move was prompted by international concern and anxiety about the continuing deterioration in the international situation from the economic  political and security point of view.The continuing ares race and the concomitant production of more sophisticated weapons of death and destruction  as well as tensions which continue to characterize relations between the two super-Powers  all heighten the risk of a nuclear confrontation which is certain to lead to the destruction of mankind.Moved by the same concerns and anxiety  the eighth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries addressed the Harare appeal on disarmament to the leaders of the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  impressing upon the two that the struggle for peace and for the prevention of nuclear war is the principal task of our time. We appeal to them yet again to heed the voice of. the great majority of mankind that the irrational and suicidal nuclear arms race should be terminated forthwith.By the end of this session and in the tradition of this lofty Assembly  dozens of resolutions will have been adopted. However  such resolutions trill not on their own produce real and concrete results towards the promotion of a world outlook characterized by a democratic and stable political atmosphere  a just and equitable international economic order  peace and confidence in the future. Only political will and statesmanship on the part of our leaders  especially the leaders of the more powerful countries  as well as a creative commitment to the principles of multilateralism on the part of all of us  will ensure a happy and safe world for all and for future generations."
